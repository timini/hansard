<p id="S5LV0011P0-00151">The KING, being seated on the Throne, and the Commons being at the Bar with their Speaker, His Majesty was pleased to make a most gracious Speech to both Houses of Parliament, and then retired.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00152">His Majesty's Speech was as follows:&#x2014;</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00153">"<i>My Lords, and Gentlemen,</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00154">My relations with foreign Powers continue to be friendly.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00155">The state of war between Italy and Turkey unfortunately still exists. My Government are ready, whenever a favourable opportunity may present itself, to associate themselves with other Powers in any mediation that may help to bring hostilities to an end.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00156">The situation in Persia continues to engage the serious attention of My Ministers, who are in constant communication with the Russian Government in regard to the best means of enabling the Persian Government to re-establish order and tranquillity in the
<col>2</col>
country. Papers will be laid as soon as possible before Parliament in connection with Persian affairs.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00157">I trust that the crisis in China may soon be satisfactorily terminated by the establishment of a stable form of Government in conformity with the views of the Chinese people. My Government continue to observe an attitude of strict non-intervention, while taking all necessary steps to protect British life and property. I fully recognise that the leaders on both sides in China have shown every desire to safeguard the lives and interests of foreigners resident in the Empire. Papers regarding the affairs of China will be laid before you.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00158">I am glad to be able to announce that at an International Conference which sat recently at The Hague and at which I was represented, an agreement was arrived at in regard to the regulation of the trade in opium and kindred drugs. A copy of the Convention, signed at The Hague on 23rd January, will be presented to Parliament.</p>

Me with overwhelming proof of the devotion of the Princes, Nobles, and Peoples of My Indian Empire to Ourselves and of their loyalty to My rule.

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00160">We were not less moved by the welcome which has been accorded to Us on Our return home and by the sympathy shown to Us by all My subjects in the personal sorrow which has overtaken My family.</p>

<title>ADDRESS IN REPLY TO HIS<lb/> MAJESTY'S MOST GRACIOUS<lb/> SPEECH.</title>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00175"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the gracious Speech from the Throne indicates many questions to be submitted to the consideration of Parliament which are undoubtedly controversial, and will in their discussion call out strongly divergent and even discordant appreciations. It is, however, gratifying to us all that the first topic on which I address your Lordships is one in which I shall, though inadequately, express the unanimous sense of the House. We all rejoice that the journey to India has been so successful in all its objects. We rejoice that it has resulted in such a strong manifestation of the loyalty and good will of the Princes and people of India, and that the personal recognition by the King of his obligations towards the hundreds of millions of our Indian fellow-subjects has called out a feeling of grateful appreciation evinced, as His Majesty tells us, not only officially but by the spontaneous expression of dutiful affection from all classes and sections of the Indian people. Although a cloud of family sorrow has darkened the return of their Majesties, on which we venture to offer our respectful sympathy, yet we may express our loyal
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0028"/>
<col>5</col>
satisfaction that from a public point of view the journey has been accomplished without any mishap or serious drawback, and we hope that the policy which His Majesty was advised by his Ministers to proclaim to his Indian subjects may increase the stability of his Indian Empire and reconcile the discordant feelings which had been aroused by previous administrative decisions.<lb/>
Passing on now to matters upon which I cannot hope to anticipate equal unanimity when they come up for definitive discussion in this House, I may nevertheless appeal to your Lordships to give them, not only fair consideration, but some measure of a friendly appreciation which may result in some conclusion to be reached not without a substantial measure of assent from both sides of the House. And first as to the Bill foreshadowed to deal with the voting qualifications of electors. I think I may appeal to your Lordships to consider the great expediency of simplifying our terribly complicated laws which affect the registration and qualification of voters. Surely we may all unite in endeavouring to secure that a person qualified to vote shall come on the register at the earliest possible moment and not have a long period of suspended electoral vitality interposed between the acquisition of the qualification and its effective exercise; and also that a person passing from one district to another should at once be put on the new register as soon as he loses his old qualifications. The complicated provisions of registration impose great expense on political organisations with no gain to any but to that expensive army of political agents which both Parties have to maintain. I think I may also appeal to your Lordships to give effect to the sound principle that a voter should vote once and not more than once. When the Referendum was under consideration, though no machinery was devised or suggested for framing an electoral roll, yet the leaders of the Conservative Party admitted that the voters on such a poll should vote once and once only. This principle is not less expedient for ordinary elections, and it is not less desirable because it is not coupled with what i agree is also a desirable change which is popularly expressed as "one vote one value," now widely advocated by Conservatives, and which is equivalent to the establishment of equal or approximately equal electoral districts.<lb/>
<col>6</col>
But, my Lords, there are two measures of special importance&#x2014;the Bill dealing with the Established Church in Wales and the Bill extending a measure of local self-government in Ireland&#x2014;which will undoubtedly occupy the greater part of the time of Parliament and absorb the greater part of public interest. I turn first to the one which we understand is to come first on the Government programme&#x2014;the Bill for the disestablishment and disendowment of the Church in Wales. This, my Lords, is no new proposal, and we have in Ireland a precedent of accomplished legislation on the same subject. What are some of the arguments by which such a proposal may be supported? First of all, I submit that the principle of State Establishment and preferential treatment of any form of religion or religious organisation is not in accordance with the present view of the great mass of statesmen. Would any Minister in organising the Government and constitution of a newly settled Colony or Dependency dream of introducing the principle of an Established Church or of concurrent endowment of all ecclesiastical bodies, or propose any State interference and control in reference to matters theological and ecclesiastical? It may be said, even if we would not do this if we had <i>tabula rasa</i>, it is a different proposition to disturb existing arrangements, the inheritance of centuries, especially if it could be added that these arrangements work smoothly and are acceptable to the population concerned. I quite admit this. I remember that Mr. Gladstone, after he had come to the conclusion that the old arguments by which he defended the union of Church and State had lost their validity, nevertheless shrank from touching the Establishment in this country, partly from feelings of deep-rooted sentiment, and partly because he felt that Governments could not outrun public opinion, and that it was rather their duty to formulate legislation for which public opinion was ripe than to be the missionaries of new views not generally accepted, even though those views were shared by them.<lb/>
Can it be said that the Established Church in Wales satisfies the conditions under which a legal settlement which we would not now create may be allowed to continue? A Conservative may think the precept <i>Quieta non movere</i> a sound one, but can any one consider that that maxim applies to the Welsh Establishment? The
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0029"/>
<col>7</col>
Parliamentary representatives of Wales, sometimes by a majority of ten to one, sometimes unanimously, tell you that their electors desire complete religious equality and complete severance of the State from all ecclesiastical matters in the Principality. If you look at the facts as to the religious preferences of the people, without haggling over disputed figures, I have no doubt that of all the people adhering to some form of religious belief not more than a fourth profess to belong to the Established Church. Visit Wales and you find throughout the length and breadth of the land, in new populous industrial districts, in sparsely peopled mountainous tracts, among the rows of workmen's cottages and at lonely cross roads, the places of worship erected by the voluntary effort mainly of the poorer classes. In fact, the Nonconformists are reproached with building chapels beyond all possible needs of the population.<lb/>
We are told that of late years the Church of England has been active and has gained ground. No doubt there has been an immense change for the better if we compare the condition of the Established Church seventy years ago and at the present day; and I think that Anglican activity, especially in the populous and growing districts of South Wales, has been largely the result of voluntary effort and does not owe very much to State Establishment. No doubt Church extension in Wales has been materially subsidised by the financial resources of the general Establishment through the funds of the Ecclesiastical Commission and Queen Anne's Bounty; but the progress of the Anglicans in Wales is mainly due to their own activity and their own efforts. I have seen figures quoted showing how, in active centres of Anglican ecclesiastical life where large sums amounting to thousands a year are raised voluntarily, the State endowment amounts now to a few hundreds, and by the operation of this Bill the hundreds would shrink to tens. But the inference I draw is not that which is suggested by those who circulate these figures. The activity which results from the necessity for self-reliance and personal effort exists already, and will only become greater when those who now are limited as well as helped by legal establishment will have more perfect freedom and a greater sense of personal responsibility in the common government of the branch of the Church to which they belong.<lb/>
<col>8</col>
My Lords, I think it is a good thing to study questions historically and to understand how the present has grown out of the past. But, after all, in dealing with political questions it is the present which chiefly concerns us. The origin of the legal obligation to pay tithes, the early endowments of bishoprics and monasteries, the growth of the parochial system&#x2014;all these matters are interesting, but they are not directly germane to the legislation proposed. Whether the Church of England is one with the Church of Rome and continuous or not is, perhaps, interesting to theologians but not to statesmen. The Tudor settlement which we call the Reformation, while maintaining and enforcing the obligations of all to conform to one legally recognised type of religion, settled that those who a few years before were burnt as heretics should alone enjoy the revenues and dignities of the Church, and not only that, but that those who were dispossessed and were formerly the executioners should now be subject to severe penalties for not submitting to the new state of things, penalties which in some cases were those inflicted for high treason.<lb/>
When we are told that it would be better to take Church funds and devote them to some new ecclesiastical body rather than apply them to secular uses, I cannot help thinking that those who propose this doctrine would be sorry to be taken at their word. When all life interests and other claims for compensation have been settled, there may be some &#x00A3;100,000 or &#x00A3;150,000 of present value available for general Welsh purposes of public utility from the funds of the Church. Surely it is better that this money should go to purposes of public advantage which will benefit all and raise the standard of civilization in Wales rather than that the State should follow the Tudor example and, while preserving legal continuity, establish a body which should condemn or set aside the doctrines and teaching of the present Church and affirm doctrines repugnant to that Church. But whatever the theoretic value of the suggestion may be it is an idle one, since the Nonconformist bodies do not ask for or want your money. They want religion to recommend itself to the free assent of the faithful of each generation, and they do not want the theology of the sixteenth century to be fixed as the standard for all time. Still less do they want, through the inevitable decay of
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0030"/>
<col>9</col>
enforced uniformity of doctrine, a free hand to be given to those who use the endowments and privileged position of an Established Protestant Church in order to reintroduce what are practically Roman Catholic ritual and doctrine, and who openly proclaim, in name as well as in substance, that the clergy are sacrificing priests and that the communion is the mass and the consecrated elements are to be worshipped. My Lords, I venture to say this confidently, that when all religious bodies and all religious opinions in Wales are put on one level of citizenship with no privileges or State aid for any, the sectarian animosities which now exist will tend to diminish, and the Welsh people will be more free to approach political questions without the Party obligation to support those who would give them this equality and to oppose those who would maintain a privileged Church.<lb/>
I now turn, my Lords, to the contemplated legislation for Ireland which foreshadows some scheme of Home Rule. As to this, without attempting to forecast what will be the provisions of the Bill which we shall see hereafter, I think I shall have the concurrence of all when I say that the problem which the Government have set before themselves for solution is one of extreme difficulty, that problem being the granting of local self-government, legislation, and executive administration to Ireland while retaining the substantial unity of the United Kingdom in all matters beyond those of purely local concern, and along with this retaining the effective supremacy of the Imperial Parliament and, I will add, of the Executive responsible to that Parliament. The Parliamentary history of the last twenty-six years records successive failures to solve this problem. And I will say for myself that I will support no illusory solution which offers mere phrases and does not give effective and direct power for the purpose of maintaining the paramount rights of the United Kingdom. But, of course, the time for examining the Bill, and, if necessary, for amending it so as to secure that the assurances of the Government shall have adequate effect given to them in the clauses of the Bill, will be when the Bill becomes public property and its clauses, as they certainly will be, are subjected to a careful scrutiny in the Press, on the platform, and in both Houses of Parliament. Meantime I would make an earnest
<col>10</col>
appeal to your Lordships and to all those whom you can influence to approach this question, if you can, with the purpose of conciliation and of bringing about a settlement. My Lords, this question has been before the country for twenty-six years since a responsible Government first made definite proposals for its solution, and it has agitated the minds and determined the policy of the majority of the Irish people for a much longer period.<lb/>
I feel myself, great as are the dangers, great as are the difficulties in dealing with the matter, that it is urgent for us to try and settle it, not by a mere <i>non possumus</i>, but by a readiness to concede much which may even in our judgment be less desirable, if by doing so we can reconcile the two nationalities while maintaining the effective legislative and administrative unity of these islands. I do not urge this from fear of any injury that a discontented Ireland can inflict upon us. The whole population of Ireland is now only about one-eleventh of the population of the United Kingdom, and of the Irish population not three-fourths are unreconciled, and I do not believe, that those three-fourths are irreconcilable. But we want something more than sullen submission with occasional outbreaks on one side; something better than arrogant repression on the other. We have against us a heavy weight of bad traditions and bad memories of an unhappy past when we and those who call themselves the loyal party in Ireland united to depress and oppress the mass of the population. Surely, my Lords, the spirit in which we should now approach this question should be one of anxious desire to conciliate and reconcile, and a willingness to run some risks for the sake of a possible&#x2014;may I say a probable?&#x2014;national benefit of immense importance.<lb/>
And, my Lords, may I remind you, without introducing a tone of Party recrimination, from which I should hope our future debates would as far as possible be free, that both sides have, I will not say trifled with the question, but have certainly from time to time allowed glimpses to be caught of a possible willingness to entertain special legislation for Ireland which should concede some measure of special local autonomy. I record Lord Salisbury's celebrated speech at Newport where he spoke of the relations of Austria and Hungary as deserving special study. May
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0031"/>
<col>11</col>
I say that that was an unfortunate illustration, as the duality of Austria and Hungary far exceeds any concession of local self-government that would in my opinion be suitable between Great Britain and Ireland. I consider that the alliance brought about through Lord Randolph Churchill with Mr. Parnell whereby Mr. Gladstone's Government was defeated in 1885 did more than anything to bring Home Rule within the range of action of responsible statesmen. I have always understood that it was the concession of an inquiry into the trials and executions for the Maantrasna murders that determined Lord Spencer's acceptance of a policy of Home Rule, for he felt that unless the Irish Executive was supported by both great Parties in Parliament government as then administered became impossible. I need not refer to the most recent ebullitions of a Sunday paper to show that the idea of some form of Home Rule was lately entertained within the ranks of the Conservatives, if thereby the old power of the House of Lords could be preserved. I hope your Lordships will excuse me for these references and not suppose that I make them as though I were the pot bandying abuse with the kettle. I touch upon them to show that for some time both Parties have recognised that the <i>status quo</i> was becoming, I will not say impossible to maintain, but more and more difficult, and more and more exposed to criticism which is hard to refute.<lb/>
I would appeal to the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition, and who therefore leads, not the House, but the overwhelming majority of this House, whether he, with his great knowledge of Ireland and with, I am sure, his great sympathy with the Irish people, does not earnestly long to find some way of escape from the bitter consequences of the past. My Lords, my task in dealing with this question of Ireland is not an easy one.
<quote>"Incedo per ignes Suppositos cineri doloso."</quote>
I am as resolved as ever that I will be no party to legislation which breaks up the effective unity for Imperial purposes of the United Kingdom. If Ireland were in the South Pacific we could have a Colonial solution, and make that country as independent as Australia or Canada. But we cannot do this, and the solution is therefore more complicated. Let us, however, approach the task not with a desire to
<col>12</col>
influence passion or under pretence of extreme loyalty to threaten Civil War. Confident that many of your Lordships are as anxious as I am for a peaceful, safe, and lasting settlement, I trust you will not only to-day vote the Address in reply to the gracious Speech, but will at a later date endeavour, even at some sacrifice of our own conviction of what is absolutely best, concede something to those dissenting and even hostile convictions which now cherish a deep-rooted unfriendliness in Ireland and among those of Irish race in Great Britain, in our Colonies, and in the great American Republic. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00176"><member>LORD FURNESS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, although a newcomer to this historic Assembly, I have been here long enough to realise that a speaker rising for the first time, especially in performing the honourable duty allotted to me this afternoon, may feel assured of receiving every consideration from your Lordships. I have singular pleasure in seconding the Address on an occasion so profoundly interesting. This first Parliament summoned by His Majesty King George V will undoubtedly leave an exceptional impress upon the pages of history. But, however important may be the other contributory causes, none, I venture to say, will prove so illustrious and beneficent as the sojourn of the Sovereign and his gracious Consort in India, so happily inspired and so satisfactorily conducted. While echoing sincerely the language of His Majesty's Speech in this regard, I am sure that your Lordships will gladly recognise that the King's initiative and enterprise in this particular has vastly enlarged the capacity and opportunities of the Monarchy for the improvement of the lot of the Peoples. I so fully endorse the sentiments expressed by my noble friend the mover of the Address, that I feel I shall best meet the circumstances of the hour and the wishes of the House by passing on at once to that part of His Majesty's Speech relating to a subject of the highest importance of which I have intimate knowledge and experience.<lb/>
The most disquieting element manifest at the moment is the latest phase of the differences between Capital and Labour. This is no question of Party politics: all shades of opinion can and surely ought to unite in an effort to solve the greatest domestic problem which lies immediately in front of us. Just now the kingdom rests
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0032"/>
<col>13</col>
under a heavy cloud of industrial controversy, but I have little doubt that if all of us resolve honestly to bring to its consideration our entire experience and resource the difficulties may be overcome. The keystone which holds us together as a community is our sense of individual responsibility, and both Capital and Labour must shoulder their respective responsibilities, just as they accept the privileges which the progress of civilisation has conferred. I sometimes fear that these organised forces do not realise as fully as they might their responsibilities to the nation at large. Their tenacity to their conception of their respective rights and duties has a tendency to magnify rather than appease the differences which arise from time to time, and, as a consequence, drive apart instead of welding together those workmen and employers who are on a footing of cordial relations, and would naturally prefer to remain undisturbed in pleasant co-operation were they permitted to do so by their respective Federations.<lb/>
Of one thing there can be no possible doubt: the restlessness and uncertainty of the industrial situation are working incalculable harm to our trade supremacy. What, then, is the remedy for a state of things so menacing to the prosperity and strength of our country? It is true that the conditions of modern industry have eliminated that close personal contact and association which formerly existed between the employer and his workmen; it is equally true that the development of industry&#x2014;apart from this lack of personal association&#x2014;has given the workman very much more than did the old system, whether as to time or money. So important is the advantage of personal contact between employer and employed and the close identification of the interests of both, that it is highly desirable to have this ready intercourse in some form largely reintroduced. In the pressure of circumstances its claims have been neglected. To-day it is asserting its importance with no uncertain voice.<lb/>
Given an understanding spirit, assuming a right temper, I know nothing in the circumstances of industry to-day to prevent a peaceful solution of the difficulties that from time to time arise. I do not suggest that the solution will be found either easily or quickly. It is a tiresome and trying business, and therein lies a
<col>14</col>
difficulty. Over a long series of years efforts have been made, by arbitration, by conciliation boards, and by direct negotiation, to settle disputes without a resort to barbarous methods. But since the formation of Employers' Federations and Workmen's Federations there is, I fear, developing a too ready disposition on both sides to cling to the spirit of the strike and the lock-out. With the expansion of industry you have on the one hand the huge combinations of capital necessary to successful production on modern lines; on the other, great masses of workers arrayed in equally solid combinations. So that any serious contention between the two results in suffering and loss, not only to the parties immediately concerned, but even more so to the community as individuals and through its business ramifications to the nation as a whole.<lb/>
On the men's side there is the steady increase of grievances to be dealt with at their head-quarters; the process of settlement cannot keep pace with it, and the accumulation of these grievances accentuates the feeling of soreness that originally prompted them. On the employers' side there is the consciousness that much valuable time of responsible officials is given up to the consideration and settlement of disputes, coupled with the knowledge that such settlement as is arrived at may not be respected by the men whose leaders have agreed to it, on their behalf, as their accredited official representatives. That sort of proceeding, apart from its moral aspect, is totally opposed to the necessities of modern business, which is everywhere engaged in eliminating unnecessary and wasteful elements in costs of production. For friction, with its losses and wastes, we need to substitute consolidation of interests with harmonious association. My own feeling is that much irritation arises from the over-centralisation of these matters by employers and workmen alike.<lb/>
The difficulties which now so seriously handicap industry would largely vanish if grievances could be at once dealt with on the spot where they arise, before large bodies of men become disaffected. That was an outstanding feature of the co-partnery scheme which I tried in my shipyards. A works' council was formed, and there were on it officials of the yards and representatives appointed by the workmen
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0033"/>
<col>15</col>
engaged in the various trades of the industry. That council dealt at once with the troubles which arose in those shipyards from time to time, whilst through it the workmen received information relating to the course and conditions of trade. The spirit of amity was cultivated, and on that side the co-partnery was an undoubted success. It was given a twelve months' trial, the men having undertaken that in no circumstances would they strike, whilst the firm bound itself not to resort to a lock-out. Unfortunately, the renewal of the scheme was affected by external conditions that were brought to bear upon the men who had worked under it, so that the promising situation in the co-partnery yards came to an end. Both employers and workmen know full well that the strike and the lock-out are barbarous weapons, but they do not yet seem to have arrived at the point of realising that such methods are entirely ineffective for the purpose of permanently settling disputes. There is urgent need for a thorough understanding of this aspect of the case and the education of both parties upon the question. Some ask, Why not make strikes and locks-out illegal? I fear the temper of our people, whether employers or workmen, would resent bitterly so large an interference with their personal liberty. For my part, I believe that reason will always secure what will be denied to force.<lb/>
In my judgment, co-partnery in one form or another will ultimately be found to be a solution satisfactory to all concerned. Granted that co-partnery is suspect both amongst workmen and employers, yet I am convinced that a careful examination of its methods must demonstrate the merits of the system to any mind that is at all free from bias. So great is my faith in co-partnery as a practical solution of this industrial problem that one is tempted to counsel His Majesty's Government that it could render few services of more vital importance at this time than by advising the Sovereign to appoint a Royal Commission for the purpose of reporting upon the value and expediency of the remedy of co-partnery as a means of ending industrial strife in our midst. It is hard to believe that, if the principles and practice of co-partnery were minutely and candidly discussed, both the leaders of the employing class and the leaders of Labour would not arrive at the conclusion that in the interests of our common country it was their bounden
<col>16</col>
duty to give the remedy a sympathetic trial. And in any event, I earnestly believe that if the chieftains of Capital and Labour persist in using against each other the weapon of stubborn tenacity, and refuse to walk in ways more in harmony with common sense, they will inflict upon the nation, and at no distant date, one of the gravest injuries it has ever sustained in the whole course of our history. I beg to second the Address.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00177">Moved, That an humble Address be presented to His Majesty in reply to the gracious Speech from the Throne.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Sheffield.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00178"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, upon this occasion His Majesty's Government have rather conspicuously departed from what was at one time a more or less established practice in regard to the selection of the Peers to whom was assigned the difficult task of moving and seconding the Address. I can remember the time when such Peers were generally selected on the ground that they had yet their Parliamentary spurs to win, and there was a consecrated phrase usually employed by the Leader of the Opposition, who congratulated the mover and the seconder, always with an added expression of the hope that, encouraged by their success, they would take a frequent part in the discussions in this House. To-day I feel myself debarred from the use of that consecrated phrase. My noble friend the mover is not only a frequent but a formidable participator in our debates&#x2014;formidable occasionally even to those who sit immediately around him. The noble Lord who seconded comes to us with considerable experience of the House of Commons, and with all the weight and authority which belongs not only to a great employer of labour, but to one whose name is identified with a courageous experiment for the purpose of bridging over in that reasonable spirit which is referred to in His Majesty's gracious Speech the unfortunate gulf which at present too often separates Capital and Labour. I am sure the House listened with interest to what he had to say as to co-partnership. For myself I feel strongly that any one who is able to bring a substantial contribution to the solution of these all-important problems deserves the gratitude of the whole community. I was almost tempted to say that the selection of two such noble Lords seems to us an
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0034"/>
<col>17</col>
indication that His Majesty's Government were perhaps conscious that their case was rather a difficult one, and that it therefore stood in need of two such strong exponents.<lb/>
May I be allowed to associate myself with all that was said by the noble mover in regard to the visit of their Majesties to their Indian Dominions? We expected that that visit would be a successful one, but I think we may say, quoting the words used by the King himself in a Message addressed to the Prime Minister, that the success exceeded all expectations. And it was, if I may say so, in all respects a wonderful achievement. Whether we have regard to the immense distances traversed, to the millions of people with whom His Majesty was brought face to face, to the immense strain, physical and mental, which this great Royal progress involved, or last but not least to the impression&#x2014;I believe a lasting impression&#x2014;produced upon the people of India by their Majesties' visit, we must consider that that progress through India was an achievement probably unequalled in the history of the Royal House. Another feeling occurs to our minds now that their Majesties are once more with us&#x2014;a feeling of relief. These long voyages, made under changing skies and varying climates, bring with them risks from which no traveller can escape. But royal travellers run other risks, about which we do not like to say much, but which are real risks, and particularly real when the countries visited are Eastern&#x2014;countries which we know are the home of fanaticism. Those risks were faced by their Majesties with an intrepidity which commands all our admiration, and that feeling, I venture to think, intensifies the depth of the welcome with which we received them back to these shores. We must all regret that a gloom was thrown over their homecoming by the death of a member of this House very closely connected with their Majesties, and one who had earned the affection and respect of all who were privileged to know him.<lb/>
Before I leave the visit of their Majesties to India may I be allowed to say that I noticed with satisfaction that it was not suggested to us by the noble mover that the success of the Royal visit was to be attributed mainly or even in part to the historic announcement made by His Majesty on the occasion of his visit to
<col>18</col>
Delhi. Any such assertion would, I conceive, imply a much too modest estimate of the effect produced upon the people of India by the demeanour and characteristics of their Majesties themselves. There can be no doubt as to the effect produced by the personal influence of His Majesty or again as to the reverence, spontaneous and inborn, which was paid to him as the incarnation of a rule which, in the minds of the people of India, stands for justice, the protection of the weak against the strong, good administration, and, above all, irresistible strength. But as to the policy announced at Delhi there is room for doubt, and we shall have something to say about it upon a future occasion. It is mentioned in His Majesty's gracious Speech that a Bill will be introduced dealing with this subject; but there are questions connected with it which do not really arise out of the kind of Bill which I understand His Majesty's Government are likely to introduce. The Bill is apparently intended rather to deal with what one may call the technical aspects of the case&#x2014;the arrangements which will be made for the readjustment of the different Provincial Administrations; whereas the points to which we, I think, are likely to call attention are points of a different kind. I refer, for example, to the wisdom of removing the capital from Calcutta, and to the wisdom of choosing Delhi as the place to which that capital is to be removed. We shall also have something to say about the question of expense. I own frankly that I mistrust the estimates which have been made of the expense involved as much as I have mistrusted other estimates put forward by His Majesty's Ministers. Then I think we shall have a word to say as to the extraordinary secrecy observed With regard to these changes&#x2014;a secrecy which, remember, carried with it inevitably the result that it was impossible for the Government either here or in India to consult fully all those who in ordinary circumstances would have been consulted in regard to the expediency of these great changes. And finally, my Lords, it will be our duty to say something as to the manner in which His Majesty's Government have connected this new policy with the personal intervention of His Majesty. As to the Bill, all I will now say is that I cannot help thinking that this House will be placed in a somewhat unusual and somewhat embarrassing position if we are told in one and the same breath that the sanction of
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0035"/>
<col>19</col>
Parliament is necessary in order to give effect to this policy, and also that what we are asked to consider is not a proposal, but a complete and coherent policy which has been accepted as a whole by His Majesty's Government, and to which His Majesty's word has been irrevocably pledged from his Throne in Delhi.<lb/>
I will pass for a moment to the brief sentence in which His Majesty deals with the question of his relations with foreign Powers. We are all glad to see the old formula reappear, and to know that His Majesty's relations with foreign Powers are of a friendly character. I have no doubt this statement is literally correct, and yet is it not true that it is impossible for any one to look at the general situation of international politics without a feeling of very considerable uneasiness? It is no exaggeration to say that there are vast areas in which there is no approach at the present time to anything like stable equilibrium. Great changes are in progress, and great problems are presenting themselves&#x2014;problems the solution of which depends upon the temper in which they are approached; and that temper does not, I am afraid, in all cases appear to be exactly what one would desire. Both on the East and the West of our Indian Empire the old order of things is passing away. In China a Dynasty which I believe is the oldest in the world has disappeared, and a new form of government is to be given to a great Empire numbering a population equal to that of the whole of Europe and considerably exceeding the whole of Europe in extent; an Empire which includes races frugal, brave, industrious, and capable under good leadership of taking a great part either in the political or commercial or even the military affairs of the world. These changes cannot fail to affect the interests of this country. We can be no indifferent spectators, but for the moment all we can do is to trust to the neutrality and watchfulness of His Majesty's Government.<lb/>
On the other side of the Indian Empire another old Monarchy is disappearing. It seems not very long ago that his late Majesty entertained the Shah of Persia in this city. The present Shah is an exile and chaos and disorder reign in his place. The condition of Persia is a matter of very special interest to this country, for geographical reasons, on account of the
<col>20</col>
proximity of Persia to India and our interests in the Persian Gulf; and also on account of the special responsibilities which we have lately assumed in regard to Persia. In 1907 Great Britain and Russia undertook the task of maintaining the integrity and independence of Persia. The independence of Persia is, I am afraid, very shadowy at this moment, and the difficulty of maintaining its integrity is rapidly increasing. We shall be grateful for any information which the noble Marquess is able to give us in regard to Persian affairs, particularly in regard to the intentions of His Majesty's Government, acting in co-operation with the Government of Russia, to take measures for re-establishing order and tranquillity in Persia. We should like more especially to know something in regard to the condition of Southern Persia. There are disquieting accounts of Indian troops sent to Shiraz for the protection of the British Consul there, and held in a position somewhat resembling that of prisoners in that place. We should like also to know, if there is anything to be told us, what is happening with regard to the important railway project which has been much discussed in the newspapers lately&#x2014;a railway which, we understand, is in contemplation, and which would run from some point on the Russian frontier to a point on the Persian Gulf or the shores of the Indian Ocean.<lb/>
In the Balkan Peninsula things do not look very hopeful at this moment. The Albanians do not appear to be inclined to settle down under the new Turkish <i>regime</i>, whilst from Macedonia there come accounts of deplorable outrages committed sometimes by one side and sometimes by the other. We ask ourselves uneasily what is likely to happen at that critical moment when the snows melt and when disorders are apt to arise in that part of the world.<lb/>
In Tripoli, Italy and Turkey are at war, and we are glad to hear that His Majesty's Government are watching for an opportunity of mediation. All I will venture to say on that point is that I believe there is nothing so dangerous or so unlikely to produce a good result as a premature offer of mediation in a case of the kind. Then, in Morocco, France and Spain appear to be involved, each in their own region, in operations which promise to be somewhat prolonged. It is a singular thin, but Morocco appears to be fulfilling a rather
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0036"/>
<col>21</col>
remarkable prophecy, to which a friend of mine called my attention, made in 1891 by the late Lord Salisbury. Lord Salisbury then said&#x2014;
<quote>"Some day or other Morocco will be as great a trouble to Europe, and trill carry with it as great a menace to the peace of Europe, as the other Mohamedan communities further to the East used to carry twenty or thirty years ago."</quote>
Lord Salisbury's words have come remarkably true. We may congratulate ourselves that there is no menace to the peace of Europe at this moment, and yet it appears to be almost a commonplace, not only in this country but on the Continent, to say that there was a moment not many months ago when this country was on the eve of a serious quarrel&#x2014;a serious quarrel with a Power with which every right-thinking Englishman desires not only to live at peace, but to co-operate in the discharge of the great obligations which belong to two great progressive and civilising Powers. It is lamentable that these misunderstandings and apprehensions should exist, and it is the duty of all right-thinking people to endeavour to dispel them. In any effort to do this His Majesty's Government will, I am convinced, have the support of those who oppose them in regard to other questions. But I certainly will not take upon myself to tender advice to His Majesty's Government on this point, for the reason that I think they already get perhaps a little too much of it, and it is advice which appears to me to be very often based upon a misapprehension as to the facts.<lb/>
I will, with the permission of the House, give an illustration of my meaning. I see that His Majesty's Government are continually adjured to arrive at a general understanding with Germany as to all outstanding questions very much in the same way as the late Government came to an understanding with France in 1904. I noticed the other day a remarkable speech delivered by the right rev. Prelate who presides over the diocese of Winchester. It was a speech in which I entirely concurred. He dwelt upon the horror with which nine Englishmen out of ten would look on any serious difference between this country and Germany, and he said that the heart and head of the British people revolted from such an idea. Then he went on to draw his conclusion, which was this. He said it was the duty of the country to constrain the diplomats and to insist upon what he called a genuine
<col>22</col>
<i>entente</i> with Germany. May I be allowed to appear as a witness to character on behalf of the diplomats? It is quite true that in 1904 the late Government came to an understanding with France about a number of outstanding questions, questions which, I think, might he described as of a sub-acute, if not of an acute character. They had reference, for example, to the relations of the two countries in Siam, in the New Hebrides, in Newfoundland, and in Egypt. In that case there were ample materials for what might be called an all-round understanding. But there was no such array of acute and outstanding questions between this country and Germany, and for this excellent reason, that for the previous twenty years one British Government after another had been settling these questions as they arose, and settling them to the satisfaction of both countries. I will not trouble the House with an enumeration on of the different Agreements arrived at. There must have been, I should think, from fifteen to twenty altogether, relating to all parts of the world, and affecting, amongst other things, our respective interests in the Western Pacific, Samoa, New Guinea, Heligoland, East Africa, West Africa, South-West Africa, and, finally, our spheres of interest in China. The result was that when we went to Germany, as we went to all the Powers, for an Agreement as to Egypt, upon the same lines as our Agreement with France, the British and German Governments came to the conclusion that it was better to restrict the negotiations to questions connected with Egypt only. That was done. There was, I think, a little Treaty of Arbitration which was made about the same time, but that really was all that there was an opportunity of doing at the moment. I do not suggest that nothing more remains to be done in that direction now; but what I do suggest is that, in the past, so far as I am aware, the diplomatists have always been ready to settle these questions with Germany in the most friendly manner, and so, I have no doubt, is the Government which is now in power.<lb/>
And may I be permitted to say, seeing the Secretary of State for War in his place, that if his genial presence at Berlin on a recent occasion has at all contributed to so desirable a result, if he has come back with anything in the nature of an olive branch in his button-hole, we shall congratulate him on this side as warmly as he
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0037"/>
<col>23</col>
will be congratulated by his friends on the other side of the House. Such a solution would have this further advantage, that it may enable the noble Viscount with a lighter heart to abstract from his Expeditionary Force whatever number of men may be necessary in order to ensure the safety of his own colleagues when they make excursions wholly unconnected with olive branches. I will only say this much more in regard to foreign affairs. I am glad to see that Papers have been promised to us, because during the last year or so we have been very meagrely supplied with information as to a number of these important international questions.<lb/>
I now pass to the programme of legislation which we are asked to consider. For that programme I can only find one appropriate epithet, and that is the word preposterous. And yet, immense as it is, there are remarkable omissions. I do not know whether those omissions are covered by a very remarkable clause at the end of the Speech to the effect that Parliament is to be invited to consider proposals for dealing by legislation with "certain social and industrial reforms" That is a splendidly elastic formula. I should be inclined to say that the word "certain" was inappropriate, and that an element of uncertainty entered very largely into the calculation. I do not know whether that little sentence is intended merely to refer to minor and comparatively insignificant Bills of the kind which are often described as Departmental Bills or whether, as some of us suspect, it is intended to cover a great deal more. I own myself that I lean towards the latter hypothesis. I will tell the noble Marquess frankly that I interpret those words as a kind of saving clause under cover of which His Majesty's Government will hold themselves free to do what they have done on other occasions, and that is to take up, in the middle of the session, under the influence of Party exigencies, proposals which are not their own proposals, but which are forced upon them by the more exacting section of their supporters.<lb/>
There is one omission which I notice&#x2014;perhaps a minor omission, but I should like to refer to it. I see no reference to any legislation for improving the position of those small holders who at present rent their farms from the local authorities. The noble Marquess must be very well aware that a great many of these people are by
<col>24</col>
no means grateful for the privilege of renting land at a rental considerably in excess of the ordinary prevailing agricultural rents, and thereby buying the freehold of their farms by instalments, not for themselves, but for the local authority. That point has been a good deal discussed, and I certainly understood that some members of His Majesty's Government had distinctly stated that legislation was contemplated for the purpose of meeting what is an undoubted grievance. Then I should like to know why nothing is put down in consequence of the recommendations contained in the Report of Lord Haversham's Committee, which many of us have read with great interest, and which strongly presses the necessity of doing something to protect sitting tenants whose farms, for reasons with which we are all familiar and which are clearly indicated in the Report of the Committee, are being put on the market in constantly increasing numbers. I say nothing as to the omission of such questions as Poor Law reform or the relations of local and Imperial taxation. Of course these matters have to be put aside while His Majesty's Government are playing tricks with the Constitution, or attacking the Church, or doubling the electorate. But there is one very important omission which I cannot pass by without a word of notice&#x2014; reform of the House of Lords. Have the Government quite forgotten the words of the Preamble of their own Parliament Bill? Have they quite forgotten the Prime Minister's pledge that this great question should be taken up during the lifetime of the present Government? Have they quite forgotten his admission that the obligation to do this was an obligation of honour?<lb/>
Now a word as to the measures which are included in the gracious Speech. I do not believe that any British Ministry ever embarked upon such a task as His Majesty's Government have set to themselves for this session. May we be allowed to say that we do not regard these vast commitments as a sign of strength and vigour in His Majesty's Ministry. TQ us they seem, on the contrary, to be indications of helplessness and subserviency. So much so that I do not think it too much to say that the principal measures in the programme are legibly labelled with the names of the particular political factions which are to be placated by their introduction. There is the Bill dealing with the Welsh Church.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0038"/>
<col>25</col>
The noble mover made a Second Reading speech on that question. The thought did cross my mind that he would not have made a Second Reading speech in moving the Address if he had believed that the Bill had any chance of coming up to your Lordships' House. The Bill is described as one to deal with the establishment of the Church in Wales, and to make provision for its temporalities. Was there ever a more grotesque euphemism for a process which might be described in much more simple language as taking away 18<i>s</i>, 6<i>d</i>. in the pound from your victims and leaving them 1<i>s</i>, 6<i>d</i>.? That Bill is notoriously introduced in the hope of obtaining a large body of Nonconformist support for His Majesty's Ministers. I for one am not at all convinced that that support will be forthcoming. I believe that the weakness of the case, in spite of the able advocacy of the noble Lord, is becoming more and more evident to the people of this country, including the Nonconformists. There has been lately a very interesting extra-Parliamentary inquest upon this question. Two right rev. Prelates, whom I may be allowed to congratulate upon their indefatigable exertions, have been dealing freely with the question, and I think they and those who have been acting with them have succeeded in throwing the greatest possible doubt on the arguments and particularly on the statistics which are advanced in favour of this attack upon a part of the Church of England. The noble Lord made what seemed to me a very important admission. I think I heard Min say that he could not deny that the Church in Wales had gained ground in recent years. That is part of the ease. We believe that the Church in Wales is a progressing Church; we believe that. its income is not at all in excess of its requirements; we believe that the funds which you are going to take from it belong to it; and we believe that by depriving the Church of these funds you will denude of religious ministrations a great many remote districts where the ministrations of the clergy of the Church of England are the only ministrations which are available for the people. It is no consolation to be told that these abstracted funds are going to be used, as the noble Lord told us, for the general benefit of Wales. I presume that what that means is that what is taken away from these unfortunate dwellers in remote places is to be spent on such institutions as public libraries or public washhouses
<col>26</col>
in Tonypandy or places with unutterable names in various parts of the Principality.<lb/>
I pass to the amendment of the law relating to the franchise. The noble mover dwelt upon the anomalies of the present franchise. It is quite possible, no doubt, that there are anomalies in the present franchise. But the question we want to have answered is whether His Majesty's Government are going to make an honest search for anomalies and to remedy those anomalies, whether the remedy suits their political book or not. We believe, on the contrary, that while some so-called anomalies will be touched, such anomalies as the over-representation of Ireland or the preposterous disproportion between the amount of representation accorded to different constituencies are likely to be left as they are. But not only are we to have this enormous increase to the electorate, but apparently upon the Government measure there may be drafted an excrescence which on the top of that increase will acid to the electorate something like eight millions of women. And that in spite of the often quoted statement of the Prime Minister that he regarded such a measure as a political mistake of a very disastrous kind, in spite of his admission&#x2014; made on the occasion of a deputation headed by my noble friend behind me&#x2014; that he doubted whether such a change would have the sanction of general and predominant opinion in the country. In spite of all that, he is apparently ready, at the bidding of a majority of the House of Commons, to adopt this colossal alteration in the law as his own, and to force it upon the country without further reference to the constituencies themselves. I venture to think that political levity could not go very much further.<lb/>
One word as to Ireland. The noble mover began by referring us to what he called the sad record of past misgovernment in Ireland. I do not care to go into the question of the past misgovernment of Ireland, this evening. I dare say there have been mistakes, and mistakes on both sides; but what I do protest against is our being asked, on the strength of errors committed ninny years before our time, to take a step which we at any rate are convinced would be a disastrous one. I remember Lord Dufferin had a happy
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0039"/>
<col>27</col>
phrase with reference that kind. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"Do not let us antedate our responsibilities inreland."</quote>
Then the noble Lord suggested there was a growing inclination on this side to deal in a more conciliatory spirit with the question of Home Rule, and he told the House that he believed that last year there existed within the ranks of the Conservative Party some inclination to treat home Rule as an open question. His suggestion was at any rate to that effect. I really do not know what the noble Lord referred to, but I can tell him&#x2014;and I suppose I have a right, to say something on the subject&#x2014;that I am wholly unaware that there has been any weakening in any section of the Conservative Party, or the Unionist Party, in regard to this subject. The other suggestion made by the noble mover was in the nature of a personal appeal to myself. He asked me whether I would not join him and others in an effort, as he said, to end the bitter controversies which raged round this question. The reason why we regard with unconquerable aversion these proposals to give Home Rule to Ireland is that we believe that their adoption, far from ending these bitter controversies, would prolong them indefinitely, and render them even more bitter than they are at present.<lb/>
Let me say with regard to this promised measure of Home Rule for Ireland that we look forward with genuine relief to seeing the measure itself. The sooner we get the Bill the better. We desire to emerge from the region of platitudes and plausibilities and grandiloquent assurances and false analogies to which we have been obliged to listen for many months past, and we desire to see all these translated into the clear cut language of a Bill to be laid upon the Table of this House. When that time comes we shall be able to judge of the merits of this wondrous scheme which is to lay the keel of a system applicable, not only to Ireland, but to Scotland and Wales, and, I suppose, also to England, though England is very often left out of account in these calculations, and which is also to be applicable <i>mutatis mutandis</i> to our great Dominions over the seas. We want to see this Bill which is to content the people of Ireland &#x2014;not always very moderate in their demands&#x2014;without imposing intolerable burdens on the taxpayers of this country.<lb/>
<col>28</col>
We want to see this Bill which is to give independence to an Irish Parliament without detracting, as we were told by the noble mover, one jot or one title from the supremacy of the Imperial Parliament at Westminster. We want to see this Bill which is to put executive power into the hands of men who throughout their careers have defied the law when it did not suit them to obey it without endangering the well-being of the loyal minority in Ireland. Finally we want to see this Bill which is to protect everything and everybody by a rampart of multitudinous safeguards without creating any friction between those who are defending and those who are assailing the fortress.<lb/>
There is one other question with regard to Home Rule which I should like to ask. When we are told that His Majesty's Government are proposing this great revolution not because they want to purchase eighty Irish votes but because they desire to relieve the congestion from which Parliament is suffering, may we be allowed to ask this question 1 Would any Home Rule Bill that you could conceive have afforded any relief to the Parliament at Westminster in the present session? Look at the Bills which you are going to lay before Parliament. A Bill for the Disestablishment and Disendowment of part of the Church; a Bill affecting the conditions of the Union; a Bill for largely increasing, perhaps doubling, the electorate. Are any of these Bills which could have been taken off your hands by a Parliament in Dublin? Of course not I read a few days ago a speech delivered by a colleague of the noble Marquess, the Solicitor-General, who said that all that he and his friends wanted for Ireland was a Bill which would enable the Irish Parliament to deal with the parish pump. I wonder if the noble Lord will contend for one moment that the Church, the franchise, or the Union are to be classed in the same category with the parish pump.<lb/>
I will ask another question, not referring to Home Rule, but to the whole catalogue&#x2014; What hope can His Majesty's Government have of carrying the whole of these Bills during the present session of Parliament? If they have no hope, if these Bills are merely what is commonly called "window-dressing," then I say they are committing a fraud on the
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0040"/>
<col>29</col>
people of this country by announcing them. If they intend to push them through, by what methods do they intend to accomplish that result? I have seen it said, and I believe truly said, that in an ordinary session only sixty days are available in the House of Commons for Government legislation. I believe that last year the closure was resorted to ninety times. How many closures will you have this year if you are going to push the whole of this programme through? And do not let it be forgotten that this year the session begins considerably later than usual.<lb/>
Another question. Where do the House of Lords come in in your programme? We are constantly told that even under the Parliament Act the House of Lords have very extensive opportunities for consultation, revision, and delay if necessary. How are those opportunities going to be afforded to us in regard to all these great Bills-and let me remind the noble Marquess that we are entitled under the Parliament Act to receive them a clear month before the end of the session? If His Majesty's Ministers mean business with regard to these Bills we must have them at least a month before the end of the session. I hope His Majesty's Government will not be deluded by the precedent of the Insurance Act of last session, which was allowed to go through in spite of the lateness of the date at which it reached this House because we were aware that owing to its financial character it would not be possible for us to deal with it in Committee. But I shall be surprised if your Lordships are equally complacent with regard to the Bills mentioned in the gracious Speech from the Throne.<lb/>
Again, what room are you leaving in this programme of yours for the discussion of finance? The Budget of 1911 only came up to us in the month of December. Are these days when we can afford to dispense with the discussion of the finances of the country? I believe that one of the most alarming symptoms of the age in which we live is the apparent indifference of a large part of the people of this country to the reckless prodigality of the Government of the day. I do not care how good the objects are. Money may be spent on the most laudable objects, but that does not in the least relieve Parliament from the obligation to discuss the financial proposals
<col>30</col>
of the Government, nor does it relieve the Government of the day from the obligation to give Parliament the fullest opportunity of discussing them. The treatment of finance by His Majesty's Government is, I honestly believe undermining the credit of this country. We look back regretfully to the time when this country could borrow money much more cheaply than any of the other Great Powers. It is true that some of them, not all of them, have to pay more for money when they borrow it than they used to do. But in no country has the national credit gone down hill at the pace and to the extent to which it has gone down hill in this country. And there is only one explanation forthcoming from business men, and that is that by your prodigal expenditure, by the manner in which you have rushed finance through Parliament, and by your attacks upon Capital, you have shaken, deeply shaken, that foundation of credit and financial stability which in former clays has tided this country through great crises in its national history. I noticed the other day that the First Lord of the Admiralty in a speech at Glasgow told his hearers that he for one was prepared to face the financial situation with composure. He said that His Majesty's Government did not intend to borrow, but that they could with the utmost case, if they wanted money, borrow &#x00A3;100,000,000. I wonder whether the First Lord of the Admiralty asked his experts what the effect of putting a &#x00A3;100,000,000 loan on the market at the present moment would be likely to be on the price of Consols. I am afraid there can be no doubt that the only result would be another downward step in the downward progress of the credit of this country.<lb/>
My Lords, I will make one final observation on the programme of the Government. It is this. It seems to me to be incredible that a Government which is in a minority in the House of Commons&#x2014;if you compare the number of its supporters with the number of any other one political Party&#x2014;it seems to me incredible that a Government which is in a minority in the House of Commons, which depends for its existence upon a coalition between different Parliamentary groups, should arrogate to itself the claim of tampering with the union of these islands, of disestablishing a part of the English Church, of doubling, if necessary, the strength of the electorate, and that it should claim to do this without an appeal
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0041"/>
<col>31</col>
to the constituencies. It seems to me equally incredible that such an attempt should be made while one of the Houses of Parliament, by the admission of His Majesty's Ministers themselves, is improperly constituted; and while the other House of Parliament so inappropriately represents the views of the people of this country that they are ready to add anything between one and eight million of voters to the number of the electors. I cannot conceive a more cynical disregard of political principles than that you should embark on such a course under such conditions. That it is fraught with disaster I feel no doubt. We have vet to see whether that disaster will befall the country, or whether it will overtake the authors of these crazy enterprises.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00179"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (THE MARQUESS OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in paying the usual compliments which the Leader of the Opposition offers on such occasions to the mover and seconder of the Address, the noble Marquess drew attention to the fact that my two friends differ in some respects from those who in former years have discharged the same duty. He pointed out that it has often been the custom on these occasions for young Peers who sit on the side of the Government of the day to try their oratorical wings for the first time as mover and seconder of the Address, and, as we know, some of the most distinguished members of your Lordships' House have won their first cheers in one or other of those capacities. It is quite true that on this occasion we are more nearly reminded of the baptism of such as are of riper years and are able to answer for themselves. The noble Marquess drew some inference from that fact, but the fact that we have called upon some more experienced members of our Party on this occasion may be partly accounted for by the generally admitted circumstance that the quite young members of this House do not usually sit on the Liberal benches. Young Peers who come to this House generally come as members of the Conservative Party. But I am sure we shall all agree that both my noble friends discharged their task with great ability. Both of them have sat in another place. My noble friend the mover of the Address, as the noble Marquess pointed out, holds a position with regard to some matters,
<col>32</col>
particularly with regard to the question of education, both in this House and in the country which is second to no other; and my noble friend who seconded the Address is also a conspicuous figure. As employer Lord Furness has more than once played a unique part in matters affecting the relations of Capital and Labour. It is quite true&#x2014;and I led to say this by an observation which fell from the noble Marquess&#x2014;that, although we look on both of my noble friends as staunch supporters of the Government, certainly we do not expect from either anything like servile acquiescence in everything we may suggest merely because it comes from us. They possess to a considerable extent that independence which is always claimed and sometimes exercised by members of your Lordships' House.<lb/>
The noble Marquess first mentioned the paragraph in the Speech which deals with their Majesties' visit to India. It is quite true that doubts were expressed by some well qualified to speak as to the wisdom or advisability of that visit. I personally was never in any way affected by those doubts, and from the very first was one of those who favoured it on every ground. It is undoubtedly the case that some of those whose first-hand experience of India was infinitely greater than mine had considerable doubts as to the wisdom of encouraging their Majesties to pay this visit, partly upon the particular ground of the almost inevitable risks involved in a visit of Sovereigns to places where great crowds are collected, and partly upon general grounds with which I confess I could never bring myself to agree. But whatever may have been the different views held at that time I think there is only one view possible now. Certainly there is only one view that can be held by anybody who was privileged to be there and saw the continuous and unalloyed triumph which attended their Majesties from the moment of their lauding at Bombay and their greeting by what I suppose is almost the most gorgeously picturesque crowd that you could see collected anywhere, through the splendid series of ceremonies at Delhi, through the magnificent heartiness of the civic welcome at Calcutta, back again to the affecting farewell which His Majesty took of his Indian subjects at Bombay. All through those varied experiences the success and triumph of their Majesties' visit was never in doubt for a moment. The events of
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0042"/>
<col>33</col>
the visit have been described by the most accomplished pens and I need not dwell noon them. We must all recognise what thanks are due to the Viceroy for the personal part he took in the preparations for their Majesties' welcome, to the Durbar Committee most ably presided over by Sir John Hewett, and also to the citizens of Calcutta and Bombay for the endless pains which they took to devise means of welcoming their Majesties.<lb/>
But if I may be allowed, by the permission of the House, for once to break the rule which we jealously observe, and desire to observe in this House, of not bringing the personality of the Sovereign into our debates, I cannot refrain from saying how much the success of the whole visit is clue to the individual account of His Majesty and of the Queen. The entire forgetfulness which their Majesties displayed of everything except the performance of the Stately duties, many of them involving long hours and much physical fatigue, which they had set themselves to undertake; their complete accessibility to all sorts of people in India; and most of all, perhaps, the air of fearless and unaffected enjoyment with which they entered into the popular side of the pageants in which they were the chief figures, contributed more than anything else to the marvellous success of their Majesties' visit. We all know what. divinity hedges a King, particularly in am Oriental country, where he is regarded as representing a special manifestation of the Divine essence and character. Their Majesties visit has in no way impaired that tremendous feeling of awe and reverence. To have achieved this and at the same time to have created about themselves an atmosphere of simple human friendliness and sympathy, means that to heir Majesties have rendered a service to the Empire and have performed a work which could only have been performed by the Sovereigns themselves and by none of their subjects, however distinguished they may be in other respects. I believe, my Lords, that the effect produced in India by their Majesties' visit will be no transient effect; but that the admiration and loyalty which they inspired will sink deep into the hearts of the Indian people. I should estimate that not less than some fifteen millions of persons must have been immediately aware of the presence of their Majesties, and that of these nearer ten millions than five millions must have seen
<col>34</col>
them face to face; and when we consider how in a country like India first-hand reports are carried from village to village and from district to district, we shall be able to appreciate to how many of His Majesty's Indian subjects the fact of his presence and personality has thus been brought home.<lb/>
The noble Marquess mentioned the further paragraph of the Speech which deals with the administrative changes which were the subject of the announcement by His Majesty at Delhi. The noble Marquess will, I ant sure, forgive me if I am not drawn by his somewhat critical tone into a discussion on this subject at this moment or even into any mention of those changes. For it seems to me that it will be better to treat the matter as a whole on that day of discussion which I hope will be an early one, as I know that noble Lords opposite are desirous of discussing the whole question. We shall then he able to consider it in all its hearings, and therefore I shall not now say anything as to the reception which the announcement met in India, although that is a point which was specially mentioned by the noble Marquess. The Indian part of the Speech contains, as the noble Marquess reminded us, a melancholy note of the <i>amari aliquid</i> which sometimes attends great triumphs and which was not absent from the return of their Majesties to these shores. The late Duke of Fife never took, either as a member of the House of Commons or as a member of this House, that part in public affairs which his natural shrewdness and his acquired knowledge might, in the opinion of those who knew him, have entitled him to take. But we can say that he will be most deeply regretted in private life by those who had the privilege of knowing him, and also in that part of Scotland in which he filled a most conspicuous place.<lb/>
Before passing away from this personal reference perhaps I may be allowed to make a very short reference to another loss which this House has sustained by the death of one of its most distinguished members&#x2014;one of the few members of whom it can be said that his reputation was absolutely European. I mean, of course Lord Lister, who although he did not often attend our debates, was one of our number of whom we were all in our hearts most proud for the great services which he had
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0043"/>
<col>35</col>
rendered to humanity during his long life, and which made him beyond all dispute one of the foremost men in England.<lb/>
The earlier part of the Speech deals with foreign affairs, and, as the noble Marquess has pointed out, it is a somewhat stormy horizon in various parts of the world at which we are obliged to look. The first topic mentioned is that of the unhappy war which still continues between Italy and Turkey. The Speech informs us that we have agreed to associate ourselves, if occasion should offer, with other Powers in offering mediation. I desire to endorse most fully the caution which fell from the noble Marquess on this point. It is easy and attractive to speak of mediation. But where two proud nations are concerned, as in this instance, you must be quite certain before you are in a position to offer mediation that a solid basis for mediation exists; otherwise your well-meant attempt may do more harm than it could possibly do good. Subject to this caution it would, of course, be a welcome possibility to his Majesty's Government, as, I believe, it would to the other great Powers of Europe, if we could see our way to offering our good offices to either country concerned with a view to the termination of this deplorable dispute.<lb/>
The noble Marquess mentioned the affairs of Persia, which have, unless I am mistaken, been the subject of more than one discussion in this House during the period that I have been unable to attend it; and, as the Speech says, the situation still continues to engage the serious attention of His Majesty's Government. Two points are, I think, worthy of special mention. In the first place, we have seen how much more deeply distracted the situation in Persia has become by the attempts of the ex-Shah of Persia to return and to obtain a footing in the country. The ex-Shah has had throughout, and was able to produce, a certain degree of following in Persia itself; but we are convinced that the best hope, if not the only hope, for the restoration of order in Persia is that the ex-Shah should leave the country. We could not recognise him in any form after the complete misgovernment and era of corruption which was associated with his former rule. Therefore it must be the desire of all friends of Persia that he should retire or he retired from the country as soon as possible.<lb/>
<col>36</col>
The noble Marquess spoke, I think, with a somewhat needless degree of pessimism of the future of Persia. He spoke of it as a disappearing monarchy. I hope that is a needlessly gloomy view to take. The existing Government there is, we believe, as determined as any Government has been to maintain the independence of Persia. But its members now fully admit and are evidently prepared to act on the opinion that it is useless, and worse than useless, to ignore the fact of Russian influence in Northern Persia, and they desire to act as far as possible in concert with their neighbours. The second point on which I wish to say a word is the continuing need of obtaining funds for Persia by which an improvement can take place in the government. I am glad to say that we have been able to arrange for a comparatively small immediate advance to Persia for immediate purposes; and I hope that that may be the prelude to the raising of a larger loan, which will enable the Persian Government to start more fairly on the restoration of order.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00180"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>:
Would the noble Marquess say whether the advance is a British advance or a joint advance?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00181"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: It is a joint advance of equal amount from Russia and ourselves. Then the noble Marquess particularly and naturally mentioned the southern area in which our interests are so prominent. We are bound to remember that all through these disturbed times we have received a number of representations from subjects of His Majesty whether British or Indian, who are interested in Persian trade, and some of our critics, I think, have not quite fully recognised that it is impossible for us altogether to ignore those representations. His Majesty's Government are strongly averse to direct interference in Persian affairs, and if any member of His Majesty's Government more than another has reason to be so averse it is the man who fills the office which I have the honour to hold. From the Indian point of view for more reasons than one anything like direct interference in Persia is thoroughly objectionable. In the first place, we have no desire&#x2014;quite the contrary&#x2014;to send Indian troops to Southern Persia, because that is not the purpose for which the Indian Army exists, and the actual difficulties which would confront
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0044"/>
<col>37</col>
our forces there are, owing to the nature of the people and of the country, always likely to be severe. But, in the second place, we always have to bear in mind the peculiar position which Persia holds in the regard of the Mahomedan community of India. That alone makes us thoroughly averse from appearing to interfere unduly in the internal affairs of Persia. Although we have been accused of sending Indian troops to Southern Persia, we have desired to confine the sending of those troops I simply to guards for the various Consulates, and we have not permitted their being used for the ordinary purposes of escorting trade caravans. They have been simply Consular guards of the ordinary character, although somewhat stronger than in more peaceful times they would have been. What we particularly hope when the financial situation is more regular is that the Persian Government themselves may be helped to make the southern trade roads safe, which to anybody who knows the character of the great and in some cases almost semi-independent tribes who live or move along those roads is a task which requires not merely force but also the exercise of seine diplomacy.<lb/>
The noble Marquess made some allusion to, or I think desired to obtain information about, the proposal for a trans-Persian railway to India. That I have always felt is a project which from many points of view must require very close examination and careful consideration on the part of anybody who acts for Great Britain, quite apart from the particular question of the special route which such a railway might most reasonably take if it were made. The whole question is one of very serious import indeed from the Indian point of view, and it is certainly not one about which we ought to give a hurried decision, although it is an undoubted fact that some of the great trade interests in India are exceedingly anxious to see such a railway made. The whole subject is still in the region of absolute inquiry. Neither we, nor any other party, are pledged to any particular undertaking or form of undertaking, and I can assure the noble Marquess that we shall continue to watch most carefully the further stages which the project may reach and shall jealously examine all the details connected with it.<lb/>
The next paragraph in the gracious Speech deals with China. The changes in
<col>38</col>
China are so astonishing that they almost baffle any attempt at description, because it is as though the slow movement down a great valley of a glacier, taking centuries to accomplish its course, had changed at one moment into a rapid torrent. Our policy, and, 1 am glad to know, the policy of the Powers generally, is one of nonintervention. I think it has become a matter of general acceptance that a country must choose for itself what form of civilised Government it considers to be best suited to its own needs and conditions, and that it is not reasonable or wise for foreign countries to attempt direct interference with such a choice. But it is undoubtedly the case that that policy of non-intervention has been made very much easier both for us and for others by the happy absence, the almost complete absence, I think, of those attacks upon foreigners which on some former occasions in China have proved to be such a serious element in internal disturbances. As your Lordships will recognise, the exaction of reparation for attacks of that kind is apt to become almost indistinguishable from active intervention; and it is therefore satisfactory that both sides in this great national contest have abstained from attacks of that kind. Before leaving China I am unwilling to refrain from expressing one word in tribute to that very distinguished Ulsterman, Sir John Jordan, who, as the representative of His Majesty's Government in Peking through these difficult times, has shown both tact and ability of which it is impossible to speak too highly.<lb/>
The noble Marquess alluded to a topic which does not appear in the Speech, but of the reference to which it is quite impossible for me to complain, because it is a matter which has been much in the public mind of late&#x2014;I mean the relations existing between this country and Germany. Those relations have for some time past, as is familiar to everybody, not merely in this House but in the country, been a matter of anxiety, especially since the discussions which took place last summer respecting events in Morocco. The events of that time have been fully and clearly explained by my right hon. friend Sir Edward Grey and I need in no way dwell upon them. What has been so serious has not been anything between the two Governments, but the state of public opinion in the two countries. It is that which has caused the feeling of anxiety of which I spoke.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0045"/>
<col>39</col>
For instance, it is useless to blink the fact that it has been very largely believed in Germany that last summer, when those events were proceeding, we were making preparations of a special character for a. possible attack upon Germany. My Lords, there was not, and there never has been, any foundation for that belief. It is hardly necessary perhaps, speaking in this House, to make that statement. All that ever happened&#x2014;it is a matter of departmental action which will be universally recognised as not merely desirable but necessary&#x2014;was the continuance of those purely defensive, I will not say preparations, but measures, which we always take on all occasions and which were not in any way altered or specially wakened into activity on that particular occasion. I suppose it was some report of those everyday and ordinary preparations which was conveyed to Germany through the ordinary channels of information that created an impression there that we were making preparations of a special kind. Since then both Governments&#x2014;I am sure it is as true of the German Government as it is of ours&#x2014;have been concerned to check that thoroughly unnatural state of public feeling, both Governments knowing that such beliefs were not justified by facts and were not justified by the intentions of either.<lb/>
In these circumstances I think your Lordships will agree that it was a natural thing that either on one side or the other&#x2014;it is not important which&#x2014;some steps should be taken for conversation which might make it generally clear that no misapprehensions existed, and we had some reason to infer that a visit of a British Minister to Germany would not be disagreeable to the German Government. My noble friend behind me (Viscount Haldane) often goes to Germany&#x2014;I believe, as a matter of fact, he would in any case have been paying a visit there before very long&#x2014;and it seemed to His Majesty's Government, particularly in view of my noble friend's familiarity with Germany and his intimacy with many Germans, that it would be an advantage that conversations should take place, altogether without prejudice, between him and those responsible for the German Government, which could be held with more openness and frankness&#x2014;that is to say, frankness owing to their informal character&#x2014;than would be possible if regular diplomatic <col>40</col>
negotiations were entered into in the usual way. My noble friend, as we all know, went to Berlin and there had a number of conversations with distinguished members of the German Government, and I am able to say that he found them animated in quite as marked a degree as His Majesty's Government could be with a desire to dissipate any national misunderstanding which might exist.<lb/>
In the first place, both the German Government and His Majesty's Government agree that real and solid good may be done without in any way impairing on either side those friendships or bonds of various kinds which exist between Germany and Great Britain on the one side and various other nations on the other. That is a matter of common agreement between the German Government and ourselves. The noble Marquess, in a very interesting historical survey, pointed out that the reason why no general attempt has been made to settle at one blow a series of burning questions in the same manner that a settlement was arrived at between France and ourselves is that in the case of Germany no such series of questions existed, because various questions in different parts of the world had been dealt with on many previous occasions as they arose. That is no doubt perfectly true, and, as I think has been before observed in this House, one of the peculiar difficulties attending the state of feeling which has existed between Germany and ourselves is that it appeared rather to represent an atmosphere on the one side or the other rather than a state of things due to the existence of particular questions for which a particular solution might be found. Still, it is possible that there may be some questions, not perhaps in most cases of a very large or crucial character, in various parts of the world as to which some adjustment might take place between Germany and ourselves. I am quite sure that the House will not expect me to offer any details of such matters at this moment, but so far as exchanges of views on such subjects are possible, whether informal or at a later stage formal, I think your Lordships will agree they will be all to the good. But what is, I think, even more important is the spirit of complete frankness which has been displayed on both sides, and also the frank recognition which has taken place, and which we certainly desire to maintain on our side, with regard to claims
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0046"/>
<col>41</col>
to respective places in the world which Germany and ourselves fill and expect to be permitted to fill. Your Lordships will see that I have not been able to tell you anything very express or definite, but I am certainly able to say that the visit of my noble friend to Berlin has been productive of good, and I am able to express the hope that more good will come from it in the future in establishing relations of friendly frankness between the German Government, and ourselves.<lb/>
I need not, I think, allude to the other matters relating to foreign affairs which occur in the Speech except to say one word about the Opium Conference at The Hague. That is remarkable owing to the rapidity, the somewhat unusual rapidity for a. Conference of that kind, with which a conclusion has been able to be reached. That rapidity is really due to the fact that two years ago another Conference was held at Shanghai between representatives of the Powers, at which the whole question was fully discussed. But the important point which has been reached is this, and I venture to think it is one of great importance from the point of view of the Indian Government. The House is aware that the Indian Government has agreed to abandon in the course of a period which will not be a very long one the export of opium to China, and it may be assumed that to other parts of the world also the export will be limited. It was naturally felt, both by Indian opinion and by the opinion of those here who were responsible for the Indian revenues, that it was a great deal to ask a country on humanitarian grounds to check the export of a drug of that kind if there remained an unrestricted import from other sources of a worse drug or worse forms of the same drug&#x2014;that is to say, such products as morphia and cocaine&#x2014;into the very countries from which opium is being barred. The unrestricted use of opium is undoubtedly a bad thing, but the unrestricted use of morphia and cocaine is very much worse, and I am glad that the Powers have agreed to take steps with regard to the export of these most deleterious products which will prevent the replacing of opium by infinitely worse and more easily smuggled and more easily taken forms of the same or other drugs.<lb/>
I now come to the domestic part of the King's Speech, as to the form of which the
<col>42</col>
noble Marquess has dealt out criticism with no sparing hand. He considers the programme in the Speech to err both by excess and by defect. It errs by excess because, according to him, it contains various great measures which we have no chance of passing; and it also errs by defect because we do not mention a number of other measures in the kind of catalogue with which we have been familiar in Speeches from the Throne in former years. We are told that these great measures which form the bulk of the domestic part of the gracious Speech merely represent the concessions which timidity has to make to violence. I should prefer to say, and I say it with absolute conviction, that these measures of His Majesty's Government are announced in the gracious Speech because they are the measures which the people want. All the three measures are, in the opinion of a great many of His Majesty's subjects, entirely overdue. Whatever you may say about Home Rule, nobody can say that it is a new proposal. Whatever you may say about the Disestablishment of the Welsh Church, that cannot be described as a measure which a spirit of opportunism has introduced merely to satisfy a particular section of our supporters. As regards the measure dealing with the franchise and registration, noble Lords opposite know very well that for years it has been a source of complaint from a great body of our supporters, in the first place that the system of registration is such as to disqualify through no fault of their own a great number of Voters merely because they are poor, and in the second place the existence of the plural vote has for a long time been an admitted grievance of all our supporters. I confess, therefore, that, so far as the general criticism of the noble Marquess is concerned, we need not consider that it cuts us very deep.<lb/>
As to the particular measures, this is certainly not the moment and not the time of the evening at which it is necessary to discuss them. As regards Ireland, I will merely say a word on the one point which my noble friend who moved the Address mentioned as to the attitude which at various times the Unionist Party have taken towards this question of self-government for Ireland. My noble friend recalled what happened in 1885, and he also recalled what happened last year at the
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0047"/>
<col>43</col>
time when the Constitutional Conference, as it was called, was still sitting. If you go back to 1885 it was undoubtedly the case that a great many who, when the Home Rule Bill of 1886 was introduced, became and afterwards remained Unionists of a most pronounced type, had been prepared to go a considerable length, either by some form of Provincial Councils or by other expedients, in offering self-government to Ireland, and I have no hesitation in saying that in 1886 Mr. Gladstone was misled&#x2014;of course, it is open to any noble Lord to say he ought not to have been misled, but he was misled&#x2014;into believing that there was an excellent chance of settling this question of Irish self-government by some form of compromise in which both Parties would be involved. With regard to what happened last year, I believe the newspapers, and I believe some speeches also, have lately been full of a number of quotations from the Unionist Press at that time, and also&#x2014;though I speak with less confidence of this&#x2014;from speeches by Unionists implying a totally different method of approach to this subject, an entirely different tone in discussing the possibility of some arrangement with the Irish, probably of a Federal character, which would meet their wishes and finally settle the question.<lb/>
I am quite sure that my noble friend would not argue, and certainly I should not argue, that these manifestations at different periods meant that Unionists had become Home Rulers, still less that the Unionist Party had become a Home Rule Party. Neither do I pretend that these manifestations, as I call them, debar noble Lords opposite or their friends in the country from criticising any and every clause in our Bill when we produce it. But I do say that these facts, which, after all, cannot be disputed, make it ridiculous for noble Lords opposite or their friends to express a kind of holy horror at the bare notion of any form of Home Rule, and make it absurd for the Unionist Party as a whole to adopt the sort of tone towards Home Rule which we expect, and in a measure accept, from noble Lords like the noble Marquess who is not now in his place (Lord Londonderry) and those who in North-East Ireland hold the most violent views on this subject. I can assure the noble Marquess and his supporters that the Government certainly do not approach this question,
<col>44</col>
the difficulty of which I admit as does my noble friend who moved the Address, in anything like a light-hearted spirit. We entirely recognise the vast difficulties which surround it; but I think we are entitled to ask that the objections to Irish self-government should be clearly formulated and stated in detail.<lb/>
Take, for instance, the case of Ulster. I quite agree that the objections in Ulster to a Home Rule measure, so far as they are not the product of mere bigotry or the merest Party feeling, ought to be most carefully considered and weighed by those who are responsible for the measure; but I think we are entitled to ask that those who make these objections should state categorically exactly what are the results of Home Rule of which they are so afraid, and not merely meet us with vague phrases like "Catholic intolerance" and "Catholic domination," but should say precisely what they are afraid will be done by the majority of their Irish fellow-subjects who are Roman Catholics supposing an Irish Parliament is formed. It is quite true, as the noble Marquess said, that one of the arguments that weighs most with us is that of the ever-increasing congestion of business in another place. The noble Marquess recognises that congestion as fully as we do, because he is never tired of taunting us with the measures which we are compelled in self-defence to take if we are to get our Bills through another place at all. But when the noble Marquess puts to me the rather strange conundrum which he did about the present session and the measures in the gracious Speech&#x2014;Home Rule, the Welsh Church, the Franchise&#x2014;and asks me how the passage of the Home Rule Bill would be facilitated by the existence of an Irish Parliament, I confess I am so completely puzzled by the form of the conundrum that I cannot pretend to answer the particular question as to how far the passing of our Bill to create an Irish Parliament would be assisted by the fact that an Irish Parliament existed already.<lb/>
I will not dwell upon the Welsh Church, but will merely repeat that our measure is simply in response to the steady and persistent Constitutional request of many years. But I think there is this feature which it is fair to mention&#x2014;namely, that this demand comes from perhaps the most religious part, if one is to make such com-
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0048"/>
<col>45</col>
parisons, of the United Kingdom. I do not suppose there is a more religious people in the world than the Welsh people, and, therefore, when we are told of attacks on the Church and of combating of religious influences, as we are sometimes told, it is necessary, surely, to avoid the kind of confusion which may be created in some minds by comparing an enterprise of this kind for the Disestablishment of the Church with those purely secularist movements which have taken place in some other parts of the world, and which are founded upon opposition, not merely to clericalism, but to all kinds of revealed religion. It is undoubtedly true that a system of concurrent endowment, which seems to be suggested by some as a substitute for our measure, is one which has never been accepted in any part of the United Kingdom. In the abstract., in other parts of the world, no doubt much may be said for some system of the kind, but it must be recognised that the foundation of any system of concurrent endowment is utterly alien both to our traditions and beliefs. That being so, all that we can say is that it is not reasonable, in our opinion, to bind the State up with a Church which is not the Church of the majority of the people. After all, the principle of Disestablishment was accepted, and time has not, I think, diminished the value of that acceptance, in Ireland, and, if it was accepted in Ireland, it is open to say that it ought to be accepted in Wales though, of course, anybody is entitled to point out how the conditions in Wales may differ from those in Ireland. But there, again, it is not reasonable to treat the whole thing as a matter that ought not to be touched if you are willing to agree that the principle was reasonably accepted in circumstances which, though not exactly parallel, are, at any rate, similar.<lb/>
The only other point which was raised by the noble Marquess to which I need allude is the penultimate clause in the King's Speech, which states that we are to be invited to consider further proposals for dealing by legislation "with certain social and industrial reforms." The noble Marquess seemed to be of opinion that some dark and sinister meaning lurked behind those very general words. I think I may venture to assure him that no such meaning should be read into them. The noble Marquess will not expect me, as we explicitly excluded from the Speech itself a catalogue of the minor Bills which we

hope to pass, to give him such a catalogue now. When one speaks of "minor Bills" the phrase is often a dangerous one to use, because the estimate of the importance of a Bill varies very much in the minds of different members of your Lordships' House; but I think I may safely say that there is no very large or far-reaching measure which is covered by those words.<lb/>
That, I think, is all I need say in reply to the noble Marquess. I will, however, just express the hope that the exceedingly gloomy forecast which he uttered with regard to the future of the session in the matter of time both in another place and here may prove to be an exaggerated forecast. It is obvious that the programme which has been announced in the gracious Speech is a long and heavy one, but I am certainly not prepared to admit that it represents an impossible degree of work for Parliament to undertake within the compass of the session provided that discussion is confined within limits which impartial people would agree are reasonable. At the same time, I entirely agree with him that, it is due to this House, in consideration of the terms of the Parliament Act, that a full period of discussion should be given for each and every one of the measures for which His Majesty's Government are responsible.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00207"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member> rose to ask His Majesty's Government&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>1. Whether they have any information as to the alleged action of the Portuguese authorities in preventing minor children accompanied by their parents from entering the Transvaal from Lorenzo Marques, and to ask, supposing the reports on the subject to be correct, by what arrangement and under what British law the said foreign authorities demand permits to enter the Transvaal of children obviously under age.</li>
<li>2. Whether it is not a fact that under the Transvaal Registration Law of 1908 Indian parents lawfully domiciled in the Transvaal have the right to bring in their children under 16 years of age without special licence.</li>
<li>3. Whether it is a fact that the Portuguese authorities forcibly detain British Indians belonging to the Transvaal in Mozambique while their permits to re-enter the Union are being examined by the Asiatic Department of the Transvaal, and that the delays of that Department may very likely result in the deportation to India of these British subjects by the Portuguese authorities in consequence of the expiry of their "Delagoa Bay permits."</li>
<li>4. Whether His Majesty's Government have had any communications with the Government of the Union of South Africa on these subjects, and whether they have assented to an interpretation of the law which Indian citizens cannot but regard as harsh and unjust, and agreed to the unusual co-operation of the Portuguese authorities; and to move for Papers.</li></ol></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00208">The noble Lord said: My Lords, my object in putting the Questions which stand in my name on the Notice Paper is to obtain reliable information as to the actual facts of the case, and so to call public attention to a matter which seems to me more than ever to be of enormous public importance. I shall, therefore, merely explain what has been, reported to me in regard to the facts, and refrain from
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0052"/>
<col>53</col>
any comment until I have had a reply from the noble Lord who represents the Colonial Office. In regard to my first Question, as to the alleged action of the Portuguese authorities in stopping minor children, what I have heard is this. In the month of December, I think it was&#x2014;I have not got the actual dates&#x2014;some five minor children of British Indian fathers&#x2014;British Indian fathers who were lawfully domiciled in the Transvaal, that is to say, had a right to be there and were in possession of registration certificates according to the law&#x2014;left Lorenzo Marques with their parents in order to proceed to their parents' home in the Transvaal. At Rossano Garcia, in Portuguese territory, they were arrested by Portuguese police, hauled out of the train, and compelled to pay their fares back to Lorenzo Marques, and brought up for some imaginary offence before a petty officer. Their friends in the Transvaal took prompt steps by means of the telegraph and in other ways, and they were accordingly released through the intervention of the British Consul.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00209">But a gentleman named Mr. Hitch, who has been for some years secretary of the British South Africa Committee, with whom I work in this matter, and who is devoting himself entirely to the cause of British Indians in the Transvaal, went up to Lorenzo Marques to inquire into the matter. He had an interview with the British Consul, who told him that it was all a mistake, which was regretted. Mr. Bitch recognised, of course, that mistakes will happen in the best regulated families, and therefore did not press the matter any further. But as there happened to be a number of other children at Lorenzo Marques in exactly the same position who were waiting to proceed to the Transvaal to their parents, he made up his mind to accompany them, and a couple of days later the train left Lorenzo Marques with some thirty children and their parents. This is what I have heard about it. Mr. Hitch travelled by the same train on route for Johannesburg. At Rossano Garcia a Portuguese official boarded the train and demanded from the various Indians and their children their permits to enter the Transvaal. On Mr. Hitch's recommendation they one and all declined to discuss the matter with this gentleman, a Portuguese official be it remembered. He accordingly ordered them to leave the train, and, again on Mr. Ritch's advice,
<col>54</col>
they declined to do anything of the kind; and Mr. Ritch demanded, on their behalf, by what authority this Portuguese official felt called upon to interfere with the peaceful progress of British subjects into British territory. After some hesitation the official left the train, which proceeded on its way.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00210">At Komati Poort, however, the train was boarded by an immigrant officer, and the whole party were called upon to produce their permits. Naturally the children had no permits to produce. They are not required to produce permits because under the law parents are allowed to bring in their children under age without let or hindrance. But nevertheless, so I am informed, they were all arrested, detained at Komati Poort and Barberton for some days, and eventually remanded for trial in Johannesburg. I believe it to be the fact that under the Transvaal Registration Law of 1908 Indian parents who are lawfully domiciled in the Transvaal&#x2014;and it is a question of parents who have that right&#x2014;are entitled to bring in their children under sixteen years of age without any special licence; but I have heard that in another case, which has nothing to do with this particular question, a permit was demanded even in the case of an infant in arms. I want to know whether I am right in my view that the Transvaal Registration Law does not put any impediment in the way of parents who have a right to be in the Transvaal bringing in their young children.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00211">But this process of obstructing British Indians who wish to enter the Transvaal and who believe themselves to have a right to do so by virtue of their registration certificates is being carried still further, if I have been rightly informed. It appears that there are a number of Indians who are waiting at this moment, or were at the time I heard this, for permission to proceed to the Transvaal&#x2014;some ten or twenty of them who have landed at Delagoa Bay. What happens is this. They are given a visiting pass, a kind of permit or bail, which allows them to remain in Portuguese territory until their certificates, which are sent on to the Transvaal, have been examined. For this visiting pass they have to pay &#x00A3;7. You would think that, in circumstances like that, there would be every possible expedition in examining
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0053"/>
<col>55</col>
and returning their certificates, but the delays have been such that the Indian gentlemen in question have been gravely alarmed as to whether they are going to be permitted to enter the Transvaal. They have made inquiries as to what their position is, and they are told that if they overstay their visiting pass, which is only valid for one month, they will be deported to India, and the &#x00A3;7 which they have paid for the permit will be applied to the cost of their voyage. It appears that they are perfectly helpless in the matter. If the officers in charge of the Asiatic Department choose to delay the matter beyond the month, these British subjects will be sent back to India to a large extent at their own expense and will apparently have no remedy whatever. Those are the circumstances on which I beg the noble Lord to give me as full information as possible, particularly on the point as to whether His Majesty's Government have had any communication with the Government of the Union of South Africa on these subjects, and whether that which has been done&#x2014;that is if, indeed, I have been rightly informed&#x2014;has been done with the knowledge and assent of His Majesty's Government. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00212"><i>Moved,</i> That an humble Address be presented to His Majesty for Papers relating to the alleged action of the Portuguese authorities in preventing minor children accompanied by their parents from entering the Transvaal from Lorenzo Marques.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Ampthill.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00213"><sup>*</sup><member>THE UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (LORD EMMOTT)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am in a little difficulty as to the Questions put to me by the noble Lord opposite, because no official information of any kind in regard to either of them has reached the Colonial Office. With regard to the case of the children, the only information I know of is that which has appeared in a paper called <i>Indian Opinion,</i> and that information appears to coincide with the information which the noble Lord has given to the House. But we have no official information with regard to the matter at all, and therefore I cannot say whether the facts are as stated.<lb/>
The same remark applies to the point mentioned in the third Question&#x2014;namely, whether it is the fact that the Portuguese
<col>56</col>
authorities forcibly detain British Indians belonging to the Transvaal in Mozambique while their permits to re-enter the Union are being examined by the Asiatic Department of the Transvaal, and that the delays of that Department may very likely result in the deportation to India of these British subjects by the Portuguese authorities in consequence of the expiry of their Delagoa Bay permits. No complaint of any kind has reached us at the Colonial Office in regard to that matter, but I see in the paper which I have mentioned that there is a suggestion that the matters raised in the noble Lord's third Question, if not in the first, may be referred to us; and if any representations are made to my right hon. friend the Secretary of State for the Colonies he will, of course, consult the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs accordingly.<lb/>
The latter part of the noble Lord's first Question asks, supposing the reports on the subject to be correct, by what arrangement and under what British law the said foreign authorities demand permits to enter the Transvaal of children obviously under age. In regard to that inquiry, we are not in possession of the facts, and therefore it will be obvious to the House that I cannot possibly make any reply to the noble Lord. But I should like to add that if there is any particular part of this matter which the noble Lord desires me to inquire into. I will confer with him about it and see what can be done. With regard to the second Question, in which the noble Lord refers to the Transvaal Registration Law of 1908, I think the law that he must mean is the Immigration Law of 1907, and that law excludes from the lists of prohibited immigrants the wife or minor children of any person who is not a prohibited immigrant. And in connection with that matter I may remind the noble Lord that in a Blue-book already issued&#x2014;Cd. 5579&#x2014;on page 18, Ministers have promised to preserve in the new Immigration Law the effect of the Chotabhai judgment, which bears in a very important way on this particular subject.<lb/>
In regard to the last Question put by the noble Lord, no communications have been made to the Union Government in reference to the specific points raised in Questions No. 1 and No. 3, inasmuch as no com-
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0054"/>
<col>57</col>
plaints have been received by us in regard to them. Correspondence did take place in 1910 with the Union Government about other complaints referring to quite other matters, and a reference to these will be found on page 127 of Cd. 5363. The noble Lord asks, at the end of Question No. 4, whether His Majesty's Government have assented to an interpretation of the law which Indian citizens cannot but regard as harsh and unjust, and agreed to the unusual cooperation of the Portuguese authorities. In reply I have to say that we have not been asked to assent to any interpretation of the law in regard to this matter, or even in regard to matters which occurred some time ago. Therefore we have not assented in the way suggested by the noble Lord. As to Papers, in the circumstances which I have described to the House there are no Papers in regard to these questions which we can lay.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00214"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if there are no Papers which can be laid it is, of course, idle to press my Motion. But I confess that I am immensely surprised that no such Papers exist. This is not a new question. Some time ago I ventured to raise it in the House and call attention to this extraordinary co-operation of the Portuguese authorities with the authorities in the Transvaal for the purpose of impeding the lawful movements of British subjects. At that time, if I am not mistaken, I received a promise that the matter should be inquired into. Therefore there must have been communications unless that promise was not kept, and I must say that, even apart from that, it is very surprising that the Colonial Office should not be keeping a watchful eye on these matters and inquiring into circumstances which are matters of general knowledge. They appear in the newspapers; they have been brought to the notice of the Department by my friends with whom I work in this matter in repeated communications, to which I am bound to say we have had little more than a bare acknowledgment. But, anyhow, I should have thought that the Department, knowing the enormous importance of this subject, would feel, after it has gone on so long without a final and satisfactory settlement being arrived at, that they ought to be watching it carefully from day to day and ascertaining what are the actual facts in regard to any complaints or representations which appear in the newspapers even if they are not
<col>58</col>
brought directly to their notice. But I shall take care that the circumstances are brought directly to the notice of the Colonial Office, and I hope that it will result in correspondence which will clear up the facts and allow the public to know exactly what has happened.<lb/>
I am bound to say that it is bitterly it disappointing to me that these questions should have dragged on so long without our being appreciably nearer a settlement&#x2014;the settlement which has been promised again and again, and which we have been told year after year was at hand and would shortly be accomplished. But instead of a settlement there does not appear to be, from the cases which I have just cited, any improvement in the relations between the two communities. It is evident that the troubles of our Indian fellow-subjects are not at an end, and that the persecution&#x2014;I cannot call it by any other word&#x2014;is continuing just as much as before. We had hoped that the Imperial Conference would result in some settlement of this question. Indeed, we were given every reason to hope that it would from the assurances of those who were responsible. It is true that there was no real representation of Indian opinion at that Conference, but still it was followed by official statements which led us to hope that it would lead to the result which we so earnestly desire. But the settlement which was subsequently foreshadowed has been delayed for reasons which I need not enter into.<lb/>
Then, again, we hoped that the Coronation would have a similar effect, but it would seem that the Union Government have abandoned any intention which they held at that time of really disposing of the matter and settling it in a way satisfactory to all concerned. It looks now as if they had merely been staying their hand until after the Coronation year. And when I say that, it is not merely a suspicion on my part, but it is borne out by the public utterances of those who are responsible. A prominent member of the Union Parliament&#x2014;a Mr. Nasar&#x2014;has openly said so. But more important than his remarks are those of General Botha. General Botha, when he was in this country for the Imperial Conference, said that no one could be more anxious than he was that the British Indian questions should be
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0055"/>
<col>59</col>
finally settled to the satisfaction of all parties, and that he was very hopeful that this would soon be attained. But a little later on when he was back in South Africa, replying to a question which was put to him regarding Asiatic immigration, he is reported to have said that he would like to see the country rid of Asiatics but it was a most difficult question and would cost a good deal; the Government, however, still hoped, he said, to find a solution of the problem. I submit that these two answers, at any rate the spirit of them, are absolutely inconsistent, and certainly they are inconsistent with what my noble friend Lord Selborne told us was the policy of the Government in South Africa&#x2014;namely, to preserve to British Indians resident in that country all their existing rights, but to restrict the immigration of any further Indians. Well, my Lords, in the face of utterances like that, one cannot resist the conclusion that the representatives of South Africa say one thing while they are over here and are being well received on an occasion like the Imperial Conference or at the Coronation, and that they forget their protestations of goodwill when they return to their own country. In these circumstances I must say that I am astonished that more pressure has not been put on by His Majesty's Government. It is idle to say that you cannot interfere in a self-governing Colony. If British subjects were being subjected to similar hardship and injustice in any foreign country there would be no hesitation whatever about interference; and surely it is easier to point out to your friends that they are doing you harm than it is to do so to your enemies, because you have a greater hope of arriving at an amicable agreement.<lb/>
We have our rights in this matter as well as our fellow-citizens in South Africa. Would it be nothing at all to us if all the good that has been done by the recent momentous celebrations in India were to be undone by the bitterness and discontent arising out of this question? Surely from that point of view alone we have a right, a right which we ought to make clear to the people in South Africa, and which we surely ought to be able to persuade them is one which they should recognise and make some sacrifice, if sacrifice it be, in order to meet. We have had ample information as to the state of feeling throughout the whole of India on this subject, and ample warning as to
<col>60</col>
what the result of that feeling will be if a different spirit does not soon prevail in South Africa and if this question is not soon settled. Therefore I do with all the earnestness at my command appeal to the Colonial Office to look a little more closely into it and let us have information on the subject. I beg leave to withdraw my Motion for Papers seeing that there are no Papers to be laid.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00215"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD EMMOTT</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I, with the indulgence of the House, make one or two observations in reply to the second speech of the noble Lord? He began by saying that there must be Papers with regard to these matters. The matters which he specifies in his Questions are, on his own showing, absolutely new, and have arisen within the last month or two. I have told him that no Papers have reached the Colonial Office in regard to these matters, and when replying to his fourth Question I was naturally thinking of the form in which the Question is couched. In it the noble Lord asks whether His Majesty's Government have had any communications with the Government of the Union of South Africa on these subjects. "These subjects" can only be, I take it, the matters which he mentions in the Questions standing in his name on the Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00216"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: Which includes the interference of Portuguese officials.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00217"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD EMMOTT</member><membercontribution>: With regard to the questions that arose in 1910 we had communications with the South African Government, and I told the noble Lord that a reference to those communications may be found on page 127 of Cd. 5363. But the noble Lord went on to speak of the general question of our relations with South Africa in regard to this extremely difficult question of which the matters referred to in his specific Questions are part. I regretted to hear him say that in his opinion there is no improvement in our relations, but I am very glad to be able to assure the House that that is not my own opinion. I think that there is an improvement, and that that improvement will increase as time goes on. That is my belief as well as my hope. I must say that I regretted very much to hear some of the observations of the noble Lord in regard to Union Ministers. I do not think
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0056"/>
<col>61</col>
remarks of that kind can do any possible good. I think that they may do a great deal of harm, and if the House will allow me I would like to explain in general terms how we deal with these questions of complaints that come to us from South Africa.<lb/>
The House, of course, will know that the question of the treatment of Indians in South Africa is one of the most complicated matters that we have to deal with at the Colonial Office at the present time. Besides being complicated it is extremely difficult and delicate. The South African Union is a self-governing Dominion of the British Empire, and has the same rights as our other self-governing Dominions. We, on the other hand, have a special responsibility towards our Indian fellow-subjects in whatever part of the Empire they happen to live, It would be idle to pretend that the Ministers of the Union and His Majesty's Government at home have always seen matters in the same light, for they and we have different standpoints. It is not essential that we should always see matters in the same light at first. But I think it is essential that when differences arise between us we should, first of all, each try to understand the others standpoint; in the second place, that we here should not interfere with the proper functions of the Ministers of the Union; and, in the third place, that when we do use the influence that we undoubtedly have a right to exercise we should use it at the right time and in the right place so as to obtain the utmost possible effect.<lb/>
I must say, in respect to Union Ministers, that in my opinion they do honestly try to meet us in regard to important points. They go quite as far as the public opinion on which they have to depend allows them to go; and I must add that no greater disservice could be done to the cause of Indians in South Africa, and no greater damage to the harmonious relations which at present exist between Union Ministers and His Majesty's Government, than by our pouring in upon them a constant stream of unsubstantiated complaints founded either upon Press rumours or unsifted <i>ex porte</i> statements. Every specific complaint of substance that comes before us officially is carefully inquired into, and when necessary or advisable we communicate with South Africa about them. We correspond also on all matters of new
<col>62</col>
legislation in which the interests of Indians are concerned, and it is precisely in regard to that branch of the subject that we have often most usefully used our influence in the past. In other words, we do not intend to destroy our influence by nagging, but we are ready to deal with any question that calls for inquiry, and we shall do so in the future as we have done in the past. I have ventured to make these few general observations because there are strong reasons at the present moment why Ministers in South Africa, who have really given proofs, in my opinion, of a desire to meet us on some of the difficult questions that still await settlement, should feel that we recognise their goodwill, and will continue to work with them towards a genuine solution of this extremely difficult and delicate question.</membercontribution></p>

<title>BRITISH INDIANS IN SOUTH AFRICA.</title>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00219"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member> had also given notice to ask His Majesty's Government&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>1. Whether they have any information as to the working of the Gold Law of 1908 and the Township Amendment Act of 1908&#x2013;9 in the Transvaal which are now being put into force, and whether they have received any complaints from the British Indian community to the effect that those laws are affecting them with cruel injustice, and, if so, whether His Majesty's Government have taken any action in the matter.</li>
<li>2. Whether the provision of the Act of Union empowering the Imperial Government to advise His Majesty to withhold assent from legislation unjustly affecting British Indians is regarded as operative or not; and to move for Papers.</li>
</ol></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00220">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am profoundly discouraged in asking further Questions because I understand that, although the Colonial Office will inquire into matters in certain circumstances, it is only when they consider it necessary and advisable to do so. I also understand that it is a mischievous thing to quote the remarks of Union Ministers. I confess that I am surprised, but it seemed to me that the reply which the noble Lord gave just now
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0057"/>
<col>63</col>
was carefully prepared in intelligent anticipation of things which I might say, but which I certainly did not say.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00221">Now, my Lords, I put my next Question about the working of the Gold Law and the Township Amendment Act. The old Transvaal Law of 1885&#x2014;the law of the old South African Republic&#x2014;prohibits the holding of fixed property by Indians, denies them municipal and political franchise, and requires them to be segregated in locations. That law has never been operative, and up to the present time Indians have been able to hold property by getting their European friends to hold it in trust for them, and those trusts have been upheld by the Courts of Law. The system has been acquiesced in and supported by the Courts of Law. But these two new laws&#x2014;the Gold Law of 1908 and the Township Amendment Act of 1908&#x2013;9&#x2014;seem to require a more stringent application of this old, and, if I may say so, obsolete law, and attempts are now being made to confiscate these properties which have hitherto been held in trust in the manner I have described, and so to compel the Indians to take refuge in locations where, of course, they will be unable to carry on the businesses which they have established, some of which have been in existence for twenty years and more, and will be driven out of the country by economic ruin. At present legal segregation has been impossible, as the old law of 1885 contained no sanction to that effect, but these new laws, if they are rigorously applied, will have the effect of driving the Indians into locations. It appears from what I have heard that a beginning has been made in that way. But I will merely ask the noble Lord whether he has any information as to the facts and whether he has received any complaints.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00222">My second Question has reference to the provision of the Act of Union which protects British Indian subjects by means of the Veto of the Sovereign. This matter is one of even wider interest at the present time, for we have on the one hand the statement of the Prime Minister&#x2014;I do not know whether my memory serves me rightly or not&#x2014;that the Royal Veto is as dead as Queen Anne, and on the other hand the statement of the First Lord of the Admiralty that the minority in Ireland will have to rely for protection on the Royal
<col>64</col>
Veto. Between those two opposing statements we have to make up our minds whether there is any solid protection for British Indians in South Africa by the same means. If there are any Papers I hope they will be laid, and accordingly I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00223"><i>Moved,</i> That an humble Address be presented to His Majesty for Papers relating to the working of the Gold Law of 1908 and the Township Amendment Act of 1908&#x2013;1909 in the Transvaal.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Ampthill.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00224"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD EMMOTT</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I earnestly hope that my reply to the noble Lord this time will meet with a little more approval from him than my last reply. I must begin by telling him that since I last spoke on this question in your Lordships' House on December 6, 1911, no new complaints in regard to the working of either the Gold Law or the Township Amendment Act have reached us, but the Secretary of State has been in correspondence with the Union Government about the position of Indians under those Acts which has formed the subject of complaint in the past. The questions raised involve, as the noble Lord must know, very complicated and intricate legal issues, which it would take me a long time to explain. I am quite sure that it would be more satisfactory to the noble Lord and to the House generally that Papers should be laid in regard to them, and that is what we propose to do in regard to this particular matter. The Papers in question will contain a copy of the very important judgment in the case of <i>Tamblin</i> v. <i>Rex,</i> to which I referred on December 6 last year, and there will also be included assurances from Ministers that they do not propose to interfere with vested rights. I think that covers the first Question. In his second Question the noble Lord asks whether the provision of the Act of Union empowering the Imperial Government to advise His Majesty to withhold assent from legislation unjustly affecting British Indians is regarded as operative or not. I am not quite sure to what the noble Lord alludes. There is no provision which gives any special power&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00225"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: Section 65 of the Act of Union.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00226"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD EMMOTT</member><membercontribution>: Sections 64, 65, and 66, so far as I remember, are general.</membercontribution></p>

<col>65</col>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00227"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: I understand that Section 65 provides that "the King may disallow any law within one year after it has been assented to by the Governor-General, and such disallowance &#x2026; shall annul the law from the day when the disallowance is so made known."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00228"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD EMMOTT</member><membercontribution>: I am quite aware of that provision, but it applies to all legislation. I mean there is no provision in the Act which has a special bearing on legislation as regards Indians. The section to which the noble Lord has called attention is a general provision applying to all legislation. I do not think I ought to go into the question of the analogies which the noble Lord has brought forward. What may happen in regard to a Bill which has not yet reached your Lordships' House I do not know; and in regard to the Veto being as dead as Queen Anne, the noble Lord must know that in regard to South African legislation the operation of laws has within the last few years been delayed for a short time in order to give an opportunity for consideration. At any rate there is no provision specially dealing with this question in which the noble Lord is interested. Sections 64, 65, and 66 are entirely general in their application.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00229"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are allowed in this House to speak rather discursively on questions, and therefore with your permission, having had a very special connection with this subject and interest in it, I should like to say a few words. I do not think it is realised entirely, certainly not in this country, how very complicated and difficult this question is. I can only say for my part that I do most earnestly desire a settlement for the sake of South Africa quite as much as for the sake of India. The Indian case has been repeatedly and ably stated in this House, and elements in that case are undoubtedly very strong. You will not suppose, my Lords, that I would for a moment underrate the strength of the Indian case, or the importance of the sentiment that underlies it. It is not my business to state that case, but I want it clearly to be understood that I attach the greatest weight to it.<lb/>
But in order that this matter may be settled it is necessary that those who have the settlement of it, whether in India or
<col>66</col>
in South Africa or here, should understand the other side of this case. Now what really is in question in the matter is the comparative systems of living under Eastern and Western civilisations. If you take two traders in South Africa, equally capable, equally industrious, equally sober, equally honest, one an Indian and the other a European, the Indian will always beat the European in trade, and must do so because the Indian lives under the Eastern system of civilisation and the European lives under the Western. It is not necessary to express any opinion as to the comparative merits of those systems of civilisation. I merely state a literal plain fact which lies at the root of the whole of this question. The Eastern system of civilisation is so much cheaper than the Western that the two men in all other respects equal cannot compete on equal terms in the same town at the same business. In this is to be found the reason why in South Africa public feeling is so strong for the exclusion of Indians, and you have only begun to understand the difficulties and the complications of this question when your Lordships realise that fact. If there was no restriction on immigration at all, I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that the European trader would disappear from South Africa. At any rate that is the absolute conviction of all South Africa, and I do not myself see where the flaw is in the argument.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, suppose that gradually in this country, in county town after county town, English tradesmen were excluded and Chinese tradesmen took their places, or that Bond-street and Regent-street gradually became monopolised by Chinese tradesmen. Would public opinion remain in this country as neutral, as impartial, in the matter as it is now? Obviously it would not. Or, to put a converse case, which, fortunately, has never occurred and is never likely to occur, suppose that it was found that the land in India was all passing out of the hands of Indians into the hands of Europeans. Surely the Indian Government and public opinion in India would be very strong in favour of some regulation or some modification of such transfer.<lb/>
That brings me, my Lords, to the principle on which and through which I think these matters must be considered. It is not a sound basis, I venture to submit, to say that all subjects of the King can have
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0059"/>
<col>67</col>
the same rights in all parts of the Empire. I think a better basis is to say that the particular and special interests of each part of the Empire ought to be the first consideration of the whole Empire. I do not say that those local and special considerations should not sometimes give way to the general interests of the Empire, but I do think that those occasions should be exceptional and not general. Applying those principles to India, surely all parties in this country agree that in a matter affecting the people of India what should be considered first and foremost are the welfare and the interests of the people of India. What a reasonable inhabitant of South Africa asks&#x2014;I do not say they are all reasonable in this matter, but most of them are&#x2014;is that the interests of South Africa should be the first consideration of the Empire in considering this matter, and the solution of the difficulty is the one that my noble friend behind me (Lord Ampthill) mentioned, and which has been, I think, accepted in principle by all parties except unreasonable ones, and that is that, while South Africa should be free to restrict any future immigration, those British Indian subjects who were domiciled in the Transvaal before the war should have every possible consideration shown them. Every possible restriction on their rights as British subjects should be removed.<lb/>
I will make no comparison now between the position of these men before the war and after the war. I will only state what I believe to be literally true as regards their <i>status</i> after the war at the time when I went to South Africa. They had not, of course, a vote, nor any prospect of a vote. That was a disability in respect of white men; but there are special reasons connected with the franchise which rather remove that from the category of questions which we are considering to-day. If you remove the franchise as a disability, there are only two remaining. A British Indian subject might not own the freehold of land, and he might not engage directly in a mining enterprise. I say here, my Lords, what I have said before a Transvaal audience. I do not think those two restrictions are justifiable. I think they are not only not justifiable but they are very foolish, because they are perfectly inoperative. A British Indian is forbidden to hold land in freehold, but he holds it absolutely securely through the medium of a white man with whom he makes an arrangement. And exactly
<col>68</col>
in the same way, if he wishes to take part in mining operations he is able to do so through the co-operation of a white man. Consequently while these two were legal restrictions they were inoperative legal restrictions. And therefore really all the disabilities in respect of which we had contended at one time with the Government of the Transvaal had been removed, and when I went to South Africa there was really no question in dispute between the British Indian community and the Government.<lb/>
Now what brought about the change? Why on that serene atmosphere has a dispute arisen which I have deplored intensely and do deplore, and which I think it is of the utmost importance should cease? I have said that the policy agreed upon by all parties was that while the question of future immigration should be left to the decision of the people of South Africa, those who were domiciled in the country should have every consideration shown them. When that policy was advanced and emphasised by myself the Europeans accepted it, though I do not say without some little grumbling. The British Indians accepted it likewise; they not only accepted it, but gave me quite clearly to understand that they admitted its reasonableness and approved of it. Why was the legislation passed which has been the <i>fons et origo mali?</i> I will tell you, my Lords, and I do not say this in any way as a reflection on the British Indian community. Nothing would be more unjust than to identify them as a whole with the speculations of certain of their compatriots, whether in the Transvaal or in India. But the fact is that one day the people of the Transvaal woke up and found that they were being silently flooded by an immigration of unauthorised Indians. They found that the system was organised and had reached great dimensions, and they became thoroughly frightened. You will ask me, my Lords, for some proof of this statement. Within five years immediately following the war there were 1,500 successful prosecutions of Indians who had come into the country and whom nobody could contend had any right to be there. Police officers were having bribes offered them at every frontier post and the great majority of cases of illicit entrance escaped detection and prosecution altogether.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0011P0I0060"/>
<col>69</col>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00231"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: Yes. Police officers in the Transvaal wore having bribes offered them at every frontier post. I will not trouble your Lordships by quoting them, but if any noble Lord wishes to see the cases I have them here. I will give one instance to show the extent to which the system had gone. One Indian was convicted in Johannesburg who offered an inspector of police &#x00A3;400 a month and a sergeant &#x00A3;200 a month if they would pass any Indian who came to them with a certain certificate from this man&#x2014;that is to say, one Indian offered two police officers &#x00A3;7,200 a year. The business was sufficiently large to make it worth the while of one agent to offer two policemen a retainer of &#x00A3;7,200 a year. That will show you the size and scale on which the matter was being organised. And in another case instructions were found on an Indian who had never been in South Africa at all, giving him information wherewith to answer questions that might be put to him. He was supposed to represent an Indian who had been domiciled in the country before the war and with whom he had had no connection at all, and he had a regular little code of instructions to enable him to answer questions as to the principal people who lived in the town and the physical features of the town, with a few words in English, Dutch, and so on.<lb/>
I mention these facts to show your Lordships why it was that the people of the Transvaal became thoroughly frightened. They were afraid that this question was going to be settled over their heads, that no option was going to be left to them of saying whether future immigration should be restricted or not, and that was the origin of the legislation which has been the sole cause of the trouble. I am not here to say that there was nothing in that legislation with which fault could be found. I am not here to say that there was no criticism possible upon it. I do not wish for one moment to appear to adjust the balance of blame between the British Indians or between the South African authorities. I realise most fully the great importance of this question to India. I realise how intensely Indians feel it. But I do want your Lordships to realise that the action which was taken in the Transvaal was not wholly gratuitous. I want the people of this country to understand that it is not mere causeless selfishness on
<col>70</col>
the part of South Africans which makes them view with great anxiety the possibility of unrestricted Indian immigration, but that they have a real case and that the matter is one of immense importance to them. I believe the matter can be settled. I do not think it is beyond the limits of statesmanship to settle. There are many Indians who are reasonable, fair-minded, honourable men. With them on the one hand and the South African Government on the other, and His Majesty's Government as the honest broker between them, it seems to me that a settlement is wholly possible. I am sure it will be as deplorable for South Africa if this question is not settled as I am told by those who are in a position to know it will be for India.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00232"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (THE MARQUESS OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure the House will have listened with deep interest to the observations which have fallen from the noble Earl on the Front Bench opposite, who is able to speak on this subject with a quite unequalled degree of authority and knowledge. The noble Earl will well remember that he and I have had many communications in old days on this topic, and I entirely agree with him as to its difficulty and complication. The noble Lord, Lord Ampthill, mentioned that this subject was brought up at the Imperial Conference, not at very great length it is true, and he also said that no representative of India was present. All I can say is that I did my best as Secretary of State for India to put the position to the representatives of the various self-governing Colonies from the Indian point of view, and I hope I succeeded to some extent in putting various aspects of it before them in a light which had scarcely occurred to them all. I think, therefore, that the noble Lord is a little pessimistic in thinking that the conversations which took place at the Imperial Conference have been or are likely to remain entirely without, result.<lb/>
The noble Earl who has just sat down fairly drew attention to the main cause of the difficulty which has arisen in the self-governing Colonies in various parts of the world where the small white race governs and the coloured race competes in trade and in work. As he quite truly said, the main difficulty is due to the
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0061"/>
<col>71</col>
different standard of life; and as I ventured to point out to the representatives of some of the Dominions&#x2014;I think in particular to the representatives of some of the Antipodian Dominions who were complaining in particular of the competition of Asiatic seamen&#x2014;you cannot make it anything in the nature of a criminal charge against a man that he is content to live upon rice and water whereas his competitors demand beef and beer. But the practical result of that difference is that the one kind of labour is able to undersell the other. Then the noble Earl went on to say what also is perfectly true, that in this country we have no notion of what is meant by the competition of that cheap and cheaply-living labour, and he asked what would be felt if we were subjected to that direct competition here. My Lords, we are, indeed, fortunate in that respect.<lb/>
Similar problems of the partial or complete ousting of one class or race by another occur in many parts of the Empire, and are not always confined by any means to competition between white men and men of colour. I might give as an instance the problem which has arisen in Burma of late by the competition there of Indian cultivators who have come in in very large numbers and gradually elbowed out, by greater fitness in some respects for the particular work which is to be done, the indigenous Burman, a fact which tends to create a problem of its own. The noble Earl pointed out what some of the difficulties in South Africa have been. I am able to concur with him completely in what he said of the goodwill of the Ministers of the South African Union&#x2014;which was equally, I am sure, felt by the Ministers of the Transvaal when he was governing there&#x2014;in trying to settle this question, but I am afraid there has not been anything like universal goodwill shown by a great many South Africans in this matter. There has, I fear, been a great deal of prejudice and jealousy beyond what can be justified by the dread of trade competition. One thing, I think, which has been particularly felt by Indians in this matter is that an educated Indian of standing, belonging, perhaps, to an ancient race, is sometimes talked of as though he were in all respects exactly on all fours with the lowest type of Kaffir; and it is not to be supposed that people of a proud race, as Indians are, will consent for a moment to
<col>72</col>
be spoken of in such a way or so to be treated. Of course, we all know that to Ministers and to men of standing in South Africa matters look very differently. They quite appreciate the differences which exist between different races and different-members of those races. But there has been far too much loose talk in South Africa, as in some other parts of the Empire, on this question of colour, and it is that, I think, in particular, that Indians have resented.<lb/>
It is quite true that what Indians desire, and what India as a whole is determined if she can compass it to see done through the agency of the British Government, is that those Indians who are in Africa should have a thoroughly fair chance and should not be subjected to fresh disabilities of any kind. It is not the wish of most Indians that there should be further emigration from India to South Africa, or indeed&#x2014;in some respects I think it is a singular fact&#x2014;to other parts of the world. There is now a strong body of educated Indian opinion which takes exception to any form of Indian emigration, though emigration under indenture has been to the benefit both of the Indians themselves and the various Colonies to which they have gone. But it cannot be disputed that a growing prejudice against any form of emigration for purposes of labour exists in India, and therefore I am quite certain that any attempt, if such were made now, to flood South Africa with Indians would not be countenanced by the better class in India itself.<lb/>
There have been certain cases of the kind mentioned by the noble Earl&#x2014;there were in the past&#x2014;of unscrupulous action on the part of Indians acting as organisers with a view to securing entrance, sometimes, I am afraid, under direct false pretences, into Colonies into which they were forbidden to pass, and I think it cannot be disputed that the action taken by the various South African Governments at different times, which we have sometimes considered over-harsh and narrow, has not therefore altogether been without provocation. But I do hope and believe that the noble Lord, Lord Ampthill, is speaking with some exaggeration when he tells us that the state of feeling is as bad as ever it was, and that there is nothing to look forward to but a period of dis-
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0062"/>
<col>73</col>
satisfaction and unrest. There are. I admit, some problems of difficulty. The particular problem connected with the passage of Indians through Portuguese territory always seemed to me a peculiarly difficult one, and if the noble Lord is right in thinking that there has been some connivance&#x2014;although I do not think he mentioned a specific instance of it&#x2014;some sort of collusion between certain Portuguese authorities and certain subordinate authorities in British South Africa which has had the effect of causing Indians who had a right to return to British territory to be deported at their own expense to India, that obviously would offer, and I am quite certain would arouse, a most legitimate occasion for complaint. But I do not understand that the noble Lord quoted a specific instance where that had actually happened.<lb/>
I am sure the noble Lord will allow me to remind him that what the Colonial Office asks for&#x2014;I think naturally asks for&#x2014;in cases of this kind are the actual positive <i>data,</i> and, if possible, sworn statements of those who allege that they have been victims either of a breach of the law or of an unfair interpretation of the law. It is impossible, as my noble friend behind me (Lord Emmott) pointed out with great force, for a Governor-General in South Africa to go to the Ministers there with complaints of a merely vague or general character; and the noble Lord, I am sure, will agree that complaints of that kind must be supported by specific statements, and, so far as possible, by a mass of evidence. This question is one which has given all of us who have had at any time to do either with the Colonies or with India a great deal of anxiety. So far as I am able to judge, the position is not misunderstood by educated opinion in India. I do not believe that the sound opinion of Indians expects or demands that kind of equality of access which the noble Earl opposite has pointed out in the conditions of the British Empire it is not possible should everywhere be given; but it is undoubtedly true that any suspicion of deliberate injustice, or of prejudice, or of the sort of contemptuous treatment on the ground of colour to which I have alluded, arouses in India a deep and stern feeling of indignation. On every ground, therefore, we desire to see these causes of dispute and difficulty cleared away, and I am quite certain that the Department which my
<col>74</col>
noble friend behind me represents will not be backward in making every needed representation, where a clear case is brought forward, to our friends the Ministers in South Africa.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00233"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: I am not going to take up your Lordships' time, but perhaps I may exercise my right of reply by making a few remarks on three points. In the first place, I congratulate myself that my Questions, if they have done nothing else, have at any rate elicited the two extremely important pronouncements which we have heard from the noble Marquess the Leader of the House and my noble friend on the Front Opposition Bench. Those pronouncements will at any rate serve to call public attention to this matter, which they admit to be of such tremendous importance&#x2014;a thing which I myself have not yet succeeded in doing in spite of some five years of endeavour. May I also add that I appreciate the sympathetic tone in which those pronouncements were made. The second point on which I wish to say a word is this. I find that Section 147 of the South Africa Act says that "the control and administration of Native affairs and matters specially or differentially affecting Asiatics throughout the Union shall rest in the Governor-General in Council." It was that which gave me the impression that there was a special provision, but I was mistaken in thinking that it was to be exercised in some special manner through the Royal Veto. The third point is with reference to the statement which was made in so fair and sympathetic a manner by my noble friend. The India us themselves do not ask for unrestricted right of immigration. That cannot be too often repeated. All that they ask for is the removal of the Registration Law, which they regard, and which they cannot help regarding, as unjust, humiliating, and offensive, and which as a matter of fact is unnecessary. My noble friend says this is a question which he believes can be settled. Seeing that it is no more than the removal of a law which is no longer necessary, of course it can be settled. But what worries me and makes me anxious is that it has not been settled long ago in spite of all this lapse of time. As Papers have been promised, I withdraw my Motion.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00236"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD EMMOTT</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have absolutely no official information in regard to this matter. Curiously enough, the only information that has come before me is in the form of a newspaper rumour which

bears in the opposite direction. It is to the effect that the Indians are leaving Vrededorp because of the fear of the outbreak of an epidemic, and that suggestions are being made by the white people there that a system of quarantine should be set up to keep them in their locations and prevent them going away. Therefore the information I have is in the opposite direction, though, of course, that does not prove whether or not there is anything in the Question which the noble Lord has put.

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00287">The LORD CHANCELLOR acquainted the House that the Clerk of the Parliaments had prepared and laid it on the Table: The same was ordered to be <i>printed.</i> (No. 3.)</p>

<title>THE ARMY.</title>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00288"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF PORTSMOUTH</member> rose to call attention to the Report of the Inspector-General of the Forces on the Territorial Force, and to ask the Secretary of State for War if any, and if so what, measures will be taken to secure more efficiency and training in the Force.</p>
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0065"/>
<col>79</col>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00289">The noble Earl said: My Lords, in calling attention to the Report of the Inspector-General on the Territorial Force I am bound to say that I sympathise very much with the position in which that distinguished General, who is a friend of mine, was placed. Not only is he a great soldier, but he is a very considerate English gentleman, and reading this Report one is struck throughout with the great desire on his part to say nothing which can unnecessarily wound the susceptibilities of a considerable body of patriotic Englishmen who are acting to the best of their ability and performing work which certainly ought to be shared by a very much larger number of their fellow-countrymen. I do not know whether, when Sir John French was asked to write this Report, it was remembered by the noble Viscount&#x2014;it surely must have been remembered by Sir John French himself&#x2014;that he had before the Norfolk Commission already expressed very strong views upon the questions of training and efficiency. Sir John French was one of the principal witnesses before the Norfolk Commission, and, in reply to cross-examination on the part of the late Lord Derby, made this statement&#x2014;that in his opinion a year's continuous training is the least which would give a man an ordinary insight into discipline. Those being his views, he must have found it extremely difficult to say anything as regards efficiency in reference to the Territorial Force. Indeed, it is the striking and prominent feature in this Report that not one single word is said about efficiency.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00290">I cannot do better than go through the Report very shortly and quote to your Lordships the words of Sir John French himself. Speaking as an expert in regard to the several branches of the Force, Sir John French says, as regards the Yeomanry, in Paragraph 3&#x2014;
<quote>"With so many types&#x2014;crofters, city clerks, Highland gillies, miners, farmers&#x2014;there is naturally between &#x2026; even squadrons of the same regiment inequality in appearance and efficiency."</quote>
That is to say, he complains of there being no cohesion. In the next paragraph he says&#x2014;
<quote>"There is still, as was noticed last year, some tendency to engage in advanced schemes of manoeuvre when squadrons are quite deficient in elementary training."</quote>
And following that, the Inspector-General recommends that the course should be entirely devoted to work of an instructional
<col>80</col>
kind. He mentions fire tactics, fire discipline, rapid mounting and dismounting, mutual support, advances to and retirements from fire positions under cover, security, protection, scouting, and despatch riding. What comes into one's mind when one reads this recommendation of the Inspector-General is this&#x2014;How much of this can possibly be taught within the limited time devoted to actual training? Because in the same Report Sir John French tells us that the fifteen days are further reduced by Sundays, coming and going, and other causes.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00291">Now I come to Paragraph 6, and there Sir John French says as regards the Yeomanry&#x2014;
<quote>"Squadrons are much hampered during their annual training by recruits who are without the elementary knowledge necessary to fit them for the ranks."</quote>
I want to know what is the meaning of the phrase "elementary knowledge." I ask the noble Viscount why are untrained recruits taken to camp at all, and whether the regulations for the training of the Territorial Force are enforced which were laid down at the time when the Force was set up, because one of the most prominent features in those training regulations is&#x2014;and this applies to all and every branch of the Force&#x2014;that no pay or allowance will be issued to officers or men who do not perform the necessary drills before annual training in camp. Is it the case that these men have not had the necessary drills before they came to camp? I should like also to ask the noble Viscount whether it would be possible&#x2014;I am informed that it would not be difficult&#x2014;for him to give us a return of the average number of drills, exclusive of camp training, which is carried out by the Territorials in their several branches.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00292">The next point is the Territorial Mounted Artillery. The Territorial Mounted Artillery is the arm, says Sir John French, which will be "the most difficult to bring to a high standard of fighting efficiency," and for this purpose he goes on to say that a longer period of continuous training after embodiment than in the case of the other arms will be necessary. That seems to me to be rather a strange recommendation. Already six months is considered to be a somewhat long time in which the enemy is to wait before you are to have your Force in a state of efficiency; but, if you
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0066"/>
<col>81</col>
make it even longer than that, is it not most probable that any European war would be well over before your Territorial Mounted Artillery would be efficient and be able to be brought into play at all? Then Sir John French goes on to speak of the Royal Garrison Artillery, and in Paragraph 9 he says&#x2014;
<quote>"The officers are the weak points in the organisation. Some of the older officers are quite out of date &#x2026; but are at present indispensable owing to their local influence."</quote>
I have no doubt that is perfectly true. At the same time it is a very unfortunate feature. If I may be allowed to say so, it is not the fault of the noble Viscount, but is due to there being no means of compulsion. You are not able to deal with a free hand according to the exigencies demanded to secure efficiency. Then, as regards the Infantry, Sir John French says, in Paragraph 12&#x2014;
<quote>"The training is still in many cases too advanced considering the limited knowledge of officers and men under instruction."</quote>
And as regards the Royal Army Medical Corps, he goes on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"In most of the general hospitals the noncommissioned officers and men have a very indifferent knowledge of the first principles of first-aid."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00293">I have gone through the Report and given your Lordships the exact words of Sir John French. He does not say one word of efficiency as regards the Force as a whole or as regards any branch of the Force. On the other hand, he feels it his duty to criticise in very severe language each and every branch of the Force, and then he goes into the question of training, on which I should like to say a few words. He points out that the fifteen days' training is practically reduced to nine, and he makes certain specific recommendations as regards certain branches of the Force. He specifically recommends that the services of Territorial Artillerymen should not be accepted for less than fifteen days' training. I know there are a great many men who have the interests of the Territorial Force at heart who would not be sorry to see this particular branch of it&#x2014;the Territorial Artillery&#x2014;very much reduced, if not dispensed with, so that the men who would go into that particular branch might go into other branches of the Force. There is one very striking and remarkable thing about Sir John French's Report, and it is this, that the Report ends at December,
<col>82</col>
1910, and we have had no Report since this very belated Report. However, my Lords, we have had debates in this House and we have had information given us&#x2014;I admit most freely given us&#x2014;by the noble Viscount in this House and by Colonel Seely in another place, and we have been able to examine the reports and statements made by the noble Viscount in the country; and I am bound to say that the result of investigating the figures that have been extracted here and in another place and the statements made by the noble Viscount elsewhere does not give us any hope that things are better since Sir John French's Report.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00294">I do not wish to trouble your Lordships with any great detail or mass of figures, but I think the figures are eloquent and speak a great deal more forcibly than any general loose observations on the subject. I find this very unsatisfactory state of things&#x2014;that in January, 1910, the deficiency of the Territorial Force in officers was 1,533; that in January, 1912, that deficiency had risen to 1,848. Now how about the deficiency in other ranks? In January, 1910, the deficiency in noncommissioned officers and men was 41,161; in January, 1912, the deficiency was 47,429. Now let us look at this from the point of view of those who absented themselves from camp altogether&#x2014;that is to say, who, while nominally belonging to the Force, did not submit to even fifteen days' annual training. In 1910&#x2014;these are the figures which the noble Viscount gave me in November last&#x2014;there were 1,426 officers and 24,569 non-commissioned officers and men who absented themselves from camp altogether; in 1911 the number of officers who absented themselves from camp altogether had not increased very much, but had increased from 1,426 to 1,491; but the number of non-commissioned officers and men who had absented themselves from camp altogether had risen from 24,569 to over 32,000. Let us look at it&#x2014;exclusive, of course, of the Permanent Staff&#x2014;from the point of view of the officers and men who attended camp for the full fifteen days or more, so that we may be able to get, in a sort of rough way, some estimate as to the number of men who, even upon the very low standard of training in point of time, may be said to have fulfilled the requirements of the Territorial Force as laid down. I am sorry to say that in regard to that there is a considerable
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0067"/>
<col>83</col>
deficiency. In 1910, exclusive of the Permanent Staff, 168,175 officers and men attended camp for the full fifteen days or more; but in 1911 that number had sunk to 155,293.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00295">These figures are, I must confess, very disturbing and disheartening, but besides these general facts affecting the whole Force we have other facts dealing with particular aspects of the Force which are also very disquieting. I was told, in November last year by the. noble Viscount, that of the Territorial Force 40,000 were raw recruits under one year's service; that 32,500 men were under 19 years of age; and, as regards the mounted forces, that at the last training nearly 13,000 Yeomanry horses were hired and that less than 8,000 horses belonged to the officers and men of the Force&#x2014;and, of course, even supposing you could hire horses at the last moment, they would be strange horses and, besides, would have to be ridden by men who were untrained. That is a serious matter. Then I was also told that the Territorial Force and Field Artillery batteries were not even marked for fire tactics at annual practice&#x2014;and if they are not marked for fire tactics the men cannot be of any efficiency as Artillerymen&#x2014;and more than this, that during the past season one battery out of four did not fire a shot. I know perfectly well that the noble Viscount and the War Office have encountered great difficulties as regards the provision of ranges, but I should be much obliged if it were possible for the noble Viscount to tell us how many batteries fired over land ranges, because, as the noble Viscount knows perfectly well, the question of Artillery efficiency is not merely a question of hitting a thing at sea, but getting the guns into practice and the selection of positions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00296">I have not said anything specially about the question of musketry. I am quite aware that it would be most unreasonable to ask the noble Viscount to give us figures upon musketry. But I should like to point out that I do not think in that respect that it is so much the fault of the War Office as it is the fault of the viciousness of our system. It is really impossible to carry out musketry systematically, effectively, or efficiently except under some system of compulsion, as is the case with the Regulars and the Special Reserve. Your musketry, if it is to be valuable and useful,
<col>84</col>
must be carried out collectively, but it is very difficult to get the men to come together, and it amounts to this, that the only day on which they can be got together is a Saturday. I admit that those are great, and to a large extent insuperable, difficulties in our voluntary system, and I only refer to them for this reason, that they show the viciousness of our system. We have never been able to arrive at any satisfactory system as regards musketry, and I am afraid this is due to the inherent difficulty underlying the whole of our voluntary system.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00297">When we talk in this House of changing our system we are always confronted by the fact that we are asking for enormous drafts upon public expenditure. This is an unsatisfactory feature also about the Territorial Force, that it is becoming an expensive Force. I take the figures of the old Yeomanry and Volunteers, which is a fair comparison. Their cost for the year ended March 31, 1906, was &#x00A3;2,215,000 odd. The Territorial Force for the year ended March 31, 1911, cost &#x00A3;3,165,000. I admit that the Territorial Force in organisation, in design, and in plan is infinitely superior to the old Volunteer Force, but, at the same time, when we see how signally the Territorial Force has failed from the point of view of efficiency, it is a serious element to find the cost a considerably increasing one. I was told in November by the noble Viscount that there was no money lost over the 33,500 who failed to attend camp training, because as they were absent from camp they received no pay. That may or may not be so, but that does not apply to the general principle, because it is not an unfair inference that if those men did not receive the pay, the pay which they did not get is added to the expense of the other men. The strength of the Territorial Force is 264,000 men. If you deduct from that number the 33,500 men who did not attend camp at all, you arrive at the figure of 230,500. That figure works out to an average of about &#x00A3;13 10<i>s.</i> per man, whereas the cost of the old Auxiliary Forces averaged between &#x00A3;7 and &#x00A3;8 per man. I think it is necessary to mention the question of cost, because if we are to spend much more money upon the Territorial Force we ought to insist that we secure our money's worth by getting a really efficient Force, whatever that. Force may be. I do not myself attach so much importance to whether the Force is a large or
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0068"/>
<col>85</col>
a small Force, but, whatever the Force is, it should be a really efficient Force.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00298">It does seem to me that this question of the Home Defence Force strikes at the root of the whole of that scheme of the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War, which, if I may say so, was in my humble opinion an excellent scheme&#x2014;that is to say, that you should have an Expeditionary Force which you are able to send abroad to assert your rights, whether on the Continent or elsewhere, at once. The question of whether you can send the Expeditionary Force out of the country or not depends upon whether you have a Home Defence Force sufficient to confront an invasion of 70,000 men&#x2014;they may be 80,000 or 100,000. The Territorial Force is now asked to perform a duty which originally, when the scheme was introduced, was not placed upon its shoulders. It has to resist an invasion of picked Continental troops. The noble Marquess the Leader of the House, and, I think, the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War, when I asked in November last what would happen if we had to send our Expeditionary Force to the Continent, said that would depend on the opinion of the General Staff. It is, of course, perfectly true that the military movements of the time would have to depend upon the strategic mind and decision of the Staff. But do not let the country suppose that they have an Expeditionary Force of six Divisions of 166,000 men when, as was implied by Lord Crewe and by the noble Viscount, very possibly two of those Divisions, or one-third of the Expeditionary Force, would not be able to leave this country. What I feel is this, that unless the Home Defence Force is efficient and has the confidence of the country we may rest assured of this fact, that, if we are ever confronted by a serious European opponent, public opinion in this country will never allow the Expeditionary Force to go, and, more than that, that the freedom and utility of our Navy will be paralysed by its being tied to our shores.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00299">It is implied that there is among a certain class of gentlemen who are interested in Home Defence some bias against the Territorial Army. I happen to live near Bulford, and I am constantly in touch not only with Regular soldiers but with the Territorials, and I can assure the noble Viscount that I have never discovered the
<col>86</col>
slightest bias of any sort or kind against the Territorial Force. The dinners which used to take place in the old Volunteer days were considered to be a very good means of bringing together the various officers and men, and I resuscitated the custom by a large dinner at Andover in November last. That dinner was extremely pleasant and convivial, but I can assure the noble Viscount that, while the Hampshire Association is one of the best of the Territorial Associations, having at its head Sir Henry Crichton, there was not one single officer at that dinner who did not hold the opinion that if you are to make your Force a living Force you will have, in some shape or other, to introduce a system of compulsion. The only bias against the Force is on the part of certain political allies of the noble Viscount, who think that the Force tends to produce a feeling of what they are pleased to call militarism.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00300">I ask your Lordships to consider how curiously like in many respects the condition of affairs in regard to public opinion upon this matter is to what happened in France. In 1868, when unfortunately the health of the Emperor of the French was so indifferent that politics drifted into the hands of legal and rhetorical wind-bags, the French Government was fully aware of the efficiency, capacity, and thoroughness of the Prussian Army. They had had the most admirable information from their military attach&#x00E9;, Stoffel, at Berlin; but the French Legislature refused to establish an efficient military system. It was even with the greatest difficulty that the French Legislature established the Garde Mobile, which bore some resemblance to our Territorial Force, because there, again, there was only demanded an annual calling up for fifteen days, and Marshal Le B&#x0153;uf said he hoped to make it clear to the French Emperor that the Garde Mobile in time of peace would only be an army on paper. Well, my Lords, the war and the national disaster came, and in 1872 the French nation had, under a Republic, to establish that which they refused to recognise only four years before under an Empire.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00301">I cannot help thinking that the fault in these matters is not so much with the War Office as with the inherent vice of our present system. The noble Viscount, if I may say so, has surpassed himself in energy, in ubiquity, in resourcefulness; every conceivable device has been brought into play to attract men into the Territorial Army.
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0069"/>
<col>87</col>
But what have we seen since this question became one of interest to the country&#x2014;that is to say, since the South African War, which showed us our difficulties and our failures? We have had a succession of Secretaries of State for War, able men, honourable men, men of the greatest industry&#x2014;Lord Lansdowne, the late Mr. Arnold-Forster, Lord Midleton, and the noble Viscount opposite&#x2014;all men of ability, all men who, to speak perfectly honestly, have devoted themselves to the interests of the Army. But, my Lords, has there been any continuity in War Office administration? What has been the state of things? We have seen each and every successive Secretary of State trying his hand at remedying the failures of his predecessor. I do think that in fairness it must be borne out that there is some inherent vice in our system. Bricks cannot be made without straw. You cannot build up an Army without adequate training, and it is more than abundantly clear that the patriotic few cannot and will not have thrown upon their shoulders a national obligation which ought to be shared by all alike. Cannot we raise this question above the level of political expediency, as a matter of national necessity? Cannot we substitute, if I may be allowed to say so, for the almost perilous display of swagger and the pageantry of Empire of which we hear and see so much, the quiet resolve to place the power and the safety of England on a basis where it will rest respected because it will rest secure?</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00302"><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member> rose to call attention to recent statements with regard to the armament of our Land Forces, and to ask the Secretary of State for War whether he considers that the present armament is satisfactory.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00303">The noble Earl said: My Lords, during the recent recess some controversy has arisen upon a question which is of the most serious importance to this country, the question as to whether the Land Forces of the United Kingdom are or are not adequately armed as compared with foreign armies. Speaking at the Albert Hall in January, Mr. Bonar Law called attention to this important subject and referred to the weapons of our Regular Forces as being inferior to those of the armies of other nations. That statement has been commented upon in an adverse sense by two Ministers. One reply we have had to
<col>88</col>
Mr. Bonar Law's remark is to be found in the City speech made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on February 3. With your Lordships' permission I shall give his exact words. Mr. Lloyd George, criticising Mr. Bonar Law's statement, said&#x2014;
<quote>"He charges us with being just as bad as our predecessors in office. Well, I cannot conceive a graver accusation than that. But is the statement true? If it were true the responsibility is not ours. These weapons, such as they are&#x2014;and I am sure that what he says about their quality is absolutely incorrect&#x2014;these weapons, with one exception, were chosen by the Unionist Government."</quote>
Those words, my Lords, contain Mr. Lloyd George's answer to a very grave indictment. You will observe that Mr. Lloyd George first of all traverses Mr. Bonar Law's statement, and, secondly, by way of an alternative plea, he, if I may use legal phraseology, "confesses and avoids" the statement by putting the matter this way. "Let us assume," says Mr. Lloyd George, "that the statement is true. Even in that case the fault lies not with us but at the door of the last Unionist Government."</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00304">Let me first of all take the plea that Mr. Bonar Law's information in regard to the inferiority of our weapons is incorrect. My Lords, I venture to say that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is in no way justified in traversing that statement. There is no doubt that our rifle is inferior to some of the weapons in use on the Continent. The weapons on the Continent have certainly a very much flatter trajectory than ours. I notice that the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War, speaking at Gateshead on the night following the Albert Hall speech, also referred to Mr. Bonar Law's words. What line did he take? If the noble Viscount was correctly reported, he by no means committed himself to the flat denial that the Chancellor gave to Mr. Bonar Law's indictment. The noble Viscount first of all threw the responsibility for the indictment on to Lord Roberts, and then carefully, very carefully, avoiding the pitfalls connected with the rifle, asserted that Lord Roberts's criticism was probably really directed to the cartridge and bullet. Lord Haldane said&#x2014;I give the exact words of the report in the <i>Scotsman</i>&#x2014;
<quote>"Lord Roberts's criticism was probably really directed to the cartridge and bullet. The bullet had been criticised because it was round ended instead of sharp pointed, and it was said that it was not so effective for certain purposes, although
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0070"/>
<col>89</col>
he personally thought it a very good bullet. Lord Roberts overlooked the fact that a month before he made his speech the War Office had begun the re-armament with a new bullet. We should, he continued, in time get a new rifle which he hoped would be the best in the world."</quote>
I hope the noble Viscount opposite will correct me if I have misquoted him.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00305">I am glad to see that the noble and gallant Field-Marshal to whom the noble Viscount referred is in his usual place on the Cross Benches. I hope therefore that he will answer presently for himself. But I venture meanwhile to doubt whether Lord Roberts's criticism was directed to the cartridge and bullet, except in so far as they form part of the whole weapon of offence. The noble Viscount opposite will, I think, admit that it is not every pattern of rifle which will admit of using every description of charge. I do not think that Lord Roberts overlooked the fact that a month before he made his speech the War Office had begun what the Secretary of State for War describes as the re-armament with a new bullet; for the reason, my Lords, that our disadvantage lies not so much in the bullet as in the amount and composition of the explosive which propels that bullet, and I understand that whatever makeshift is resorted to as regards our rifle, the breech will never be strong enough to stand the strain of a charge giving sufficient muzzle velocity to gain the same low trajectory as possessed by the latest Continental weapon.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00306">If your Lordships will allow me, I will, very briefly, compare the German rifle with ours. The Germans adopted the pointed bullet in the year 1906. The muzzle velocity with this ammunition is given as 2,882 feet per second, and the extreme height of the trajectory over a distance of 800 yards is 6 ft. 10 ins. Now if we turn to our rifle with the Mark VI cartridge&#x2014;that is to say, with the ammunition with which the bulk of our troops are armed to-day&#x2014;we find that the muzzle velocity is only 2,060 ft. per second, while the extreme height of the trajectory over 800 yards is 13 ft. 4 ins.&#x2014;a difference of over 6 ft. as compared with the German rifle. This would mean that Infantry advancing to the attack over that 800 yards would be untouched by the trajectory of the bullet for a space of 595 yards, as compared with 320 yards with the German rifle. The re-armament of our Forces with
<col>90</col>
the new bullet, which we must remember has not yet taken place, will make, I admit, some difference. With the new Mark VII pointed bullet the height of the trajectory over a distance of 800 yards is brought down to 8 ft. 9 ins. But even with this your Lordships will observe that there is still a difference in favour of the German weapon of practically 2 ft. as regards the trajectory of the bullet over this distance, with the corresponding advantage of about 100 yards less dead ground. It is therefore quite clear that our Land Forces would fight to-day at a very grave disadvantage against troops armed with the weapon I have just described&#x2014;a disadvantage which will be somewhat modified but by no means abolished if the whole of our Land Forces are re-armed with the new ammunition.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00307">Now I come to Mr. Lloyd George's alternative plea&#x2014;surely the most extraordinary justification ever attempted by a responsible Minister of the Crown. He states that our present rifle and our present field gun were both introduced by a Unionist Government, and that the only weapon for which the present Government is responsible is the howitzer, which is the best in the world. It is true that the last Unionist Government introduced the rifle which was the best weapon of its time, and the field gun which, if it was brought up to date in some respects, is probably the best even to-day, only that the French gun may be superior to ours in some respects. I might also point out that the conditions to be fulfilled for quick-firing howitzers were circulated in the War Office in July, 1904, and that the last Unionist Government therefore practically initiated the howitzer for which Mr. Lloyd George takes so much credit.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00308">But, my Lords, that is not the point. The point is that there has not been a Unionist Government since 1905. Does Mr. Lloyd George, in using this argument, mean the country to understand that His Majesty's Ministers are to ignore the improvements and changes that take place in armaments as time goes on? Because a weapon is the best of its date, are subsequent Ministries justified in shutting their eyes to further developments in that particular weapon? If that is the case, they might argue with equal force that they are justified, especially with Mr. Lloyd George in the Government, in introducing into the
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0071"/>
<col>91</col>
Army the bow and arrow of the famous Welsh archers who did such gallant and deadly service at the battles of Crecy and Agincourt. No doubt the bow was the best weapon of its day, but it is one which subsequent Administrations certainly discarded as improved weapons were introduced. Such an argument as Mr. Lloyd George employed at the City Liberal Club may do fairly well to raise a laugh at a Saturday afternoon meeting, but I presume he scarcely intended it to be taken as a serious answer to what he described as a very serious charge. It is scarcely conceivable that a responsible Minister of the Crown who has held office for upwards of six years should think he was meeting criticism on the armament of our Land Forces by referring the matter back to those who held office before His Majesty's present Government attained to power. The argument is of itself, if seriously used, sufficient to condemn the Chancellor of the Exchequer as incapable of understanding the ever-changing problems connected with the defence of the Empire.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00309">Now, my Lords, in bringing up this subject, I would assure the noble Viscount opposite that I wish in no way to belittle the good work that he has done. I wish in no way, at any rate at present, to criticise the vast changes that he has introduced into our military system. The noble Earl, Lord Portsmouth, gave us some vigorous, and, I think, well-informed criticism of Lord Haldane's policy. Well, I cannot at present join hands with the noble Earl, for the very reason he himself gave at the end of his speech "that he wished to put this matter above Party politics." Lord Haldane has put forward an experiment. As an experiment I feel we should give it ample time and perhaps plenty of rope to either prove itself in or hang itself with. I also recognise that the noble Viscount has been forced to work within certain limitations imposed on him by the general feeling in this country, and within these limitations he has no doubt worked very hard to perfect our organisation. Whether the organisation which he has set up fulfils our military requirements is a question on which I reserve my opinion. But in the meantime I think that the people of this country are entitled to know exactly where they stand in relation to other countries as regards armaments.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00310">I do not propose to rake up controversies that are old and which I trust are now
<col>92</col>
passed. But we have it on the authority of the Foreign Secretary that during the negotiations between France and Germany last year, to quote his own words used in the House of Commons&#x2014;
<quote>"There was anxiety, diplomatic anxiety, not always, not constant, but intermittent, and at times considerable anxiety, as to how the negotiations between France and Germany were to find a solution."</quote>
Putting the international situation in other words, my Lords, it is clear that the horizon was clouded if not stormy. If the international situation had, unhappily, led to an outbreak of hostilities in which this country had become involved, under what conditions would we have embarked on that struggle? Can the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War say that our Expeditionary Force would not have been severely handicapped, armed with a rifle which even now with its latest alteration is, as I have shown, certainly inferior to that of one of the nations involved. The noble Viscount, in the speech to which I have already referred, said that the War Office had begun the re-armament with a new bullet. That, I notice, is after any crisis was over. I would remind the noble Viscount that the Germans adopted the new ammunition in the year 1906. Apparently it required five years and a crisis to bring us this much up to date. I think the country would prefer the armament of our Forces to keep pace with modern requirements without such stimulus. How far our rifle with the new ammunition can be said to meet modern requirements is another question. The noble Viscount in his speech finished up his remarks on the rifle by saying that&#x2014;
<quote>"The present rifle and bullet were not bad, but the new armament would give us something which, if we were ever called upon to fight against Continental troops, would be practically the same bullet as that of our opponents."</quote>
That is somewhat vague. The remark would be equally applicable to the situation were our soldiers armed with catapults instead of the present rifle. Either weapon is capable of discharging a bullet, but it does not follow that their trajectory is the same.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00311">I read a very able article in <i>The Times</i> the other day in which the writer, in analysing Mr. Bonar Law's statement, attempted a general vindication of Lord Haldane's policy. I understand that the author of that article is an official in the
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0072"/>
<col>93</col>
War Office and is in receipt of pay on the Estimates. If that is the case, it seems to me that those of us who read his articles in <i>The Times</i> will be somewhat at a loss to know whether the views he expresses are his own, or whether they are not somewhat tinged&#x2014;perhaps unintentionally&#x2014;with the views of his official Chief. Perhaps the noble Viscount will be able to reassure us on this point.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00312">My Lords, it is certain that we cannot always expect to be in the front of all other nations in our armament. With each re-armament a nation no doubt gains something on its rivals. The only law that can govern a nation's action is one of common sense. But one thing we should always remember is this&#x2014;that the initiative in war lies with other nations, not with us. If war were ever to be brought about, it would be by our opponent's action, not by ours. They would choose the time, not us. Therefore, my Lords, it behoves us to see that our small Expeditionary Force, when it is called upon to fight the battles of this country, enters upon that struggle under no serious disadvantage in respect of the weapons with which it is armed. It is because I feel that the subject of the adequate armament of our Land Forces is of importance so great&#x2014;I should hardly be exaggerating if I said of importance so vital&#x2014;to this country that I have ventured to bring the matter before your Lordships' House to-day in the hope of eliciting some definite information from His Majesty's Government.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00313"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HARDINGE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the subject of armament which my noble friend Lord Dunmore has brought before the House is a very important one. Many varied statements upon it have been made of late, not only in the Press but also on public platforms, and I trust, therefore, that the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War will enlighten us on many of these points and give us answers to some of the definite questions put to him. My noble friend Lord Dunmore has dealt very fully with the armament question, not only with respect to the rifle in the present use of the Infantry of His Majesty's Land Forces, but also with regard to the gun in use not only by the Artillery of the Line but by the Territorial Artillery. I do not intend to follow him with regard to gun armament, for I consider that in the presence of the noble and gallant Field-Marshal
<col>94</col>
on the Cross Benches it would be presumptuous in me, an Infantryman, to attempt to do so.<lb/>
I will, therefore, confine my remarks to the rifle question&#x2014;a question in which, if I may say so, I have taken the keenest interest since I first joined the Army in 1877. I presume for that reason I was employed for many years not only as musketry instructor to my regiment, but also on the musketry staff of the Army. Therefore I trust that your Lordships will consider that I am in some way qualified to speak on the rifle question&#x2014;at any rate as competent as the Military Correspondent of <i>The Times</i>, who, curiously enough, served in the same regiment as myself for many years. I can honestly say that in that regiment he was never regarded as an expert or an authority either on rifles or rifle-shooting, and from his letter in <i>The Times</i> of February 2 he does not appear to have gained much further knowledge on that question, for the only line of criticism that he attempted to take up was to throw the whole blame upon certain members of the last Unionist Government. In fact that was his only line of argument; whilst he concluded his remarks with respect to the rifle by the extraordinary statement that "the present rifle is well thought of by the men." I ask your Lordships, Was there ever a more feeble defence set up by a man who, ever since he left the Army, has endeavoured to pose as a fair military critic? To my mind the duty of a critic should be to criticise, not in the interests of one Party, but in the interests of the Army as a whole. In his letter to <i>The Times</i> I contend that his line of argument is based, not upon the true facts of the case with regard to the rifle, but purely upon motives of political partisanship, and for that reason I do not think it is worth paying any attention to.<lb/>
As most of your Lordships are probably aware, the present short Lee-Enfield rifle was first issued in 1903. I believe that at that time it was regarded as the best military weapon of the day, not because it was a handier weapon or more suitable for rapid and quick firing, but because when the rifle was fired with a fixed sight the bullet travelled at such a low trajectory as to be able to hit a man 5 ft. 6 ins. anywhere within the danger zone up to 500 yards without any alteration of sight. Any one who has been on service in the
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0073"/>
<col>95</col>
field must appreciate the immense advantages of such a weapon&#x2014;a weapon which prior to 1903 bad never been in the possession of the British Army. Military experience has taught us that whenever a new rifle is introduced it is always received by the soldiers with a certain amount of distrust and suspicion, but I know very well that when that rifle had been in their hands for twelve months the general opinion, both of officers and men, was that it was the best rifle they had ever had and that it was in no way inferior to the weapons of any Continental Army, whilst in many people's opinion it was far superior.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Dunmore has referred to the only weak point in or objection against the rifle. The only objection to it is the weakness of the breech, which I regret to think has never been altered or rectified during the last nine years, and which I consider affords good cause for criticism. In spite of the assertion contained in the letter of the Military Correspondent of <i>The Times</i>, I have no hesitation in saying that in July last, when there was every likelihood of the Expeditionary Force being called upon for active service on the Continent, it was the opinion of most Infantry officers that our rifle was inferior both to the French and to the German rifle, more especially the latter, and for this very good reason, that the German rifles fired with their fixed sight point-blank up to 730 yards. I maintain that what is the opinion of the officers is also the opinion of the men. At any rate, whether that opinion is of any moment or not, every one will agree that it is absolutely essential that when our Army goes into the field, at any rate in Continental warfare, it should be armed, not with an inferior weapon, but with a weapon, if possible, superior to that of any Continental Army.<lb/>
I did not, however, gather from the speech of the Secretary of State for War at Gateshead that at that time our Army was in that state of superiority; for the noble Viscount then said&#x2014;
<quote>"We should in time get a new rifle which he hoped would be the best in the world."</quote>
With that hope I am sure we are all in cordial agreement. But that is not the point at issue. The point at issue is, What has been done in the last six months? I
<col>96</col>
would like the noble Viscount to give me a definite answer to this question&#x2014;If our Expeditionary Force had been ordered abroad last September, would the Infantry of that Force have been armed with a rifle and bullet as good as those of the German Army? I trust that he will be able to do so. If he fails to do so, I venture to think that the statements that have been made on public platforms by certain politicians have been proved to be absolutely justifiable.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00314"><member>THE EARL OF ERROLL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to say just one word on this question of the rifle and bullet. It seems to me that it is not so much a question of the rifle or who is to blame for the rifle we have, but as to what steps are being taken to rectify the position in which we find ourselves. Our rifle is admittedly inferior to the rifle of the Japanese, of the United States, of France, and of Germany, and would no doubt put our troops to very considerable disadvantage if we were at war with any of these Powers. What we want to know is whether the steps which the Government are taking are adequate to deal with this subject, or are we merely tinkering with it. There is no object in apportioning blame. What we want to know is, What is being done? The fact remains that our rifle at the present moment is the very worst in the world among civilised Powers. No doubt when introduced some years ago it was quite good enough, but since then the high-velocity cartridge has been introduced by other Powers and the breech block in our rifle is too weak to allow the full charge being taken. The ammunition with which we are experimenting at the present moment is merely a makeshift, and does not give the same results as are given in the foreign rifle.<lb/>
What we want now is a new rifle with a powerful action, locking close up to the breech block and a much larger chamber. It is this large chamber capacity which gives the German rifle, I am told, a great advantage over ours. In spite of the new bullet and the ammunition the vertex of the trajectory only comes down to 8 ft. 4 ins. I quite admit that this is a great improvement over the old Mark VI which rose up to 13 ft. 4 ins., but we are still a long way behind the Germans, and it would put our troops at a very serious disadvantage if we were in collision with them. The late Lord
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0074"/>
<col>97</col>
Tweedmouth, who, I think, was accepted, especially by this House, as an expert in rifle shooting, said in a debate in 1904 that he put a low trajectory before everything for a practical service weapon. I believe the excuse for our not having a new rifle is that in time we shall get an automatic rifle, but I venture to think that that rifle is a very long way off, and there are some people who think it is of very doubtful advantage. While we are waiting for this new rifle we may find ourselves at war with an enemy who will have very much the same advantage over us as the Prussians had with their needle guns over the Austrians in 1866 with their muzzle loaders. The critical time or stage of a battle is during the last 800 yards. That is where the crisis generally exists. Troops with a rifle that fires point blank have very great advantage at that distance as the sights do not have to be altered and the bullet will hit the enemy all the way. With the flatter trajectory of 6 ft. which the foreigners have they have to a great extent attained this ideal. But we have not.<lb/>
I conclude by saying that our men would be very severely handicapped by having to alter their sights, or they would be shooting over the heads of the enemy. I have seen the sympathetic treatment of this question in <i>The Times</i>, and I should like to know whether that article was in any way inspired. My reason is that I believe that Colonel Repington is employed at the War Office. The noble Viscount shakes his head. I have been informed&#x2014;but I am open to correction&#x2014;that he is editor of the <i>Army Review</i>, and that in such capacity he is obtaining a fee of &#x00A3;500 a year. It seems to me that in that capacity he must have access to documents which are denied to other members of the Press. I do not see how he can be taken as an impartial critic. He must be more or less prejudiced, and I think that his criticism of the noble Viscount's scheme must be absolutely valueless. <i>The Times</i> has very great weight on military matters in this country, and it seems to me that it is quite wrong that any official connected with the War Office should be allowed to write as correspondent in the newspapers. It is unfair to the other papers and unfair to the public. As I said before, I do not think any one who has this access and this means of gaining information should be allowed to take part in this controversy.</membercontribution></p>
<col>98</col>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00315"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL ROBERTS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not propose to make any great demand on your Lordships' time and patience this afternoon, but I wish to say a few words upon one or two matters connected with our military preparations, about which it seems to me essential that there should be further discussion and a clear understanding. Up to the present a large proportion of our fellow-countrymen appear to believe that the Territorial Force is practically all that is needed for our country's safety, and that if we only have patience and give it sufficient time in which to perfect itself we shall possess a Home Defence Army to which the security of these islands can safely be entrusted. This is, in fact, the answer that I have almost invariably received from its supporters whenever I have ventured to suggest that the Territorial Force is far from being what is required, and that even if it were double the strength laid down it could not be trusted to carry out the supremely important duty for which it has been brought into being, for the simple reason that it is impossible&#x2014;no matter how long we wait&#x2014;for the Force to be given the necessary amount of training as long as it is organised under the voluntary system.<lb/>
How much longer, may I ask, my Lords, are we to wait for the promised perfecting of the Territorial Force? Ought it not to be considered what are the duties that would devolve upon that Force in time of war after the Expeditionary Force had gone abroad? Ought it not to be considered whether it could under existing circumstances ever be properly prepared for those duties with due consideration to the difficulty employers of labour have during peace in giving their employees oven 15 days' leave and only once in the year; and whether there is the slightest chance of their being able to dispense with their men's services for six months after war breaks out for training purposes? The Secretary of State for War once said that at such a time trade would be at a standstill and that the men would be only too glad of other kinds of employment. But, my Lords, will this argument bear examination? Some few trades might be slack, but, for the most part, business would be far more brisk in war time than in peace. The Territorial battalion of which I have the honour to be honorary colonel is to a great extent composed of printers and gas workers. Are printing
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0075"/>
<col>99</col>
and the demand for gas likely to be slack when a war is going on? And are the employers who have been patriotic enough to allow their men to join the Territorials to be compelled to give them up to be mobilised for six months' training, during which time the unpatriotic employers, who had refused to give their men leave to fit themselves to serve their country, would be revelling in a vast increase to their business? Surely, my Lords, this is a matter which should not be allowed to remain in doubt and upon which a definite answer should be given by the Secretary of State for War. For, if employers are not willing to let their men go, and are not to be forced to do so, the whole scheme falls to the ground, for the men would be unable to fulfil their enlistment engagement without losing their means of livelihood.<lb/>
The goal that would appear to be aimed at&#x2014;and to achieve which Lord Haldane and those serving under him are making such desperate efforts&#x2014;is that the numerical strength of the Force, as laid down by the noble Viscount, should be reached. But, my Lords, it never seems to have been realised that the numbers laid down have nothing whatever to say to the demands that may be made upon the Force. These numbers were decided upon because experience had taught us that about 300,000 was the maximum number we could possibly hope to obtain under a voluntary system. Three hundred thousand might be sufficient to deal with a couple of insignificant raids, which were all that were contemplated as likely to take place at the time that the Territorial Force was established. And it was not until 1900&#x2014;three years after the Territorial Force had come into existence&#x2014;that it was decided by the authorities that 70,000 was the number for which we had to be prepared.<lb/>
But, my Lords, for the idea that the strength of an invading force would be limited to only 70,000 there is absolutely no foundation. That number appears to have been fixed upon, as I explained to your Lordships last April, because it was the minimum number with which I myself stated, at a meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence in 1905, I believed that any commander would venture to attempt an invasion of this country. And also because the naval authorities asserted that the transports required for a larger number of men would be so numerous as to make

it impossible for them to evade our warships. Considering, my Lords, that in all the larger Continental ports steamers each capable of carrying from 10,000 to 15,000 soldiers for a short voyage can always be made available, 70,000 multiplied by two, or even by three, would require quite a small number of vessels for their transport. But, my Lords, it is not so much the possible strength of the invading force to which I desire to draw your attention as to the fact that no steps have been taken to increase the strength of the Territorial Force, while the hostile numbers against which we are supposed to have to guard have admittedly risen from 10,000 to at least 70,000. This again, my Lords, is a matter requiring the closest inquiry.<lb/>
There is still another matter of supreme importance which affects the Regular Army even more seriously than it does the Citizen Army, and that is the inferiority of the weapons with which our soldiers are armed. Lord Haldane has treated with airy levity the statement I made about these weapons in my letter to the papers last December, which he incorrectly alluded to as a "casual remark" made in a "speech." My Lords, it was no "casual remark," nor was it made in a speech, but a carefully-considered opinion arrived at after the fullest inquiry, and expressed, as I have said, in a public letter. Notwithstanding Lord Haldane's reply to Mr. Bonar Law's indictment, and in spite of the defence of the noble Viscount made in <i>The Times</i> of the 2nd inst. by its Military Correspondent&#x2014;who, by the way, as a paid official of the War Office, can hardly be expected to take quite an unbiassed view of the Secretary of State's action&#x2014;I still maintain that our soldiers are armed with inferior weapons, for, even with the improved sighting and the issue of a new kind of ammunition, our rifle is interior to the German and French rifles; and, owing to the artillery fuzes, fuze-setters, and sights not being up to date, our field guns are not automatic firing guns.<lb/>
I purposely avoided in my public letter laying stress on the serious moral effect which the inferiority of armament would have on our soldiers when they discovered, as they certainly would in the very first action, that they were not only out-numbered, but that they were out-matched as regards their weapons. Assuredly the moral effect would be very disastrous. As regards the Territorials, even supposing
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0076"/>
<col>101</col>
their arms are all that the Secretary of State claims them to be, they will be of no military value unless the men are trained to use them in an effective manner. This is the <i>crux</i> of the whole question. Let us lay aside all other points of controversy connected with Lord Haldane's scheme, and endeavour to come to some satisfactory conclusion as to how both officers and men of the Territorial Force can be sufficiently trained to admit of their being a valuable asset to the defence of the country.<lb/>
Nowadays the two essentials to success in war are discipline and skill in the use of military weapons. Not the old barrack-square discipline by which a man became part of a machine, but a discipline which gives him confidence in himself and an intelligent appreciation of unity of action. Neither of these essentials can be taught by any training that it is possible to give to Territorials under the existing conditions of their service. No amount of "organising public spirit"; no number of flattering panegyrics on the patriotism of the officers or assertions that their corps are composed of "a good fighting lot of men"; no appeals to "enthusiasm"; no additional expenditure, will have the slightest effect in making the Territorial Force anything but a make-believe, until some means are devised by which the required amount of training can be given and the Force can be filled with officers and men who have the military knowledge which would render them trustworthy on the field of battle.<lb/>
In support of my views as to the difficulty in which employers are placed in regard to the question of the training of their employees let me read an extract from a letter from an important firm of manufacturing chemists, in reply to a request from the secretary of the National Service League to be allowed to speak to their men on the subject of universal military training&#x2014;
<quote>"We regret that our manager at Hounslow is not in favour of your going there, for fear Territorial enlistment may be encouraged.

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00324">The noble Duke said: My Lords, in dealing with the Army Estimates on March 14 last the noble Viscount made the following pronouncement&#x2014;
<quote>"After five years of work we have passed out of the region of questions of principle and have got to the field of secondary problems&#x2014;some of them of considerable difficulty, and nearly all of them of detail."</quote>
I propose, therefore, to discuss questions not of principle, which, according to the noble Viscount, have been already decided for good or for ill, but of detail. The object of my Questions is to ascertain the actual reduction in the number of officers and men serving with the Colours when the Regular Army of 1905 is compared with that of 1911. There has been considerable discussion on this point, and it would be well to try and bring the controversy to a definite conclusion before the appearance of this year's Army Estimates. For my own part, I propose to confine my remarks to officers and men serving with the Colours and not to discuss any other part of our military forces.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00325">I begin with the officers. The noble Viscount, dealing with the Army Estimates on March 14 last, said&#x2014;
<quote>"We have added a good deal to the number of Regular officers in the Army during the last five years, I think 2,600."</quote>
That is a very short statement and should be clear. The officers are Regular officers, and 2,600 have been added during the last five years. But that addition, according to the Return of April 27, 1911, which I quote on the Paper of the House, has resulted for some reason or another during the same period in a decrease of 131 officers. This result is so incomprehensible at first sight that I beg to ask the noble Viscount if he would kindly explain the matter.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00326">As regards the non-commissioned officers and men, the noble Viscount, during the five years in which he has been establishing the principles now determined, has kept us informed of the increase and decrease
<col>104</col>
of the Regular Army. The noble Viscount began by telling us on March 8, 1906, that&#x2014;
<quote>"There was a rumour in the papers that I had decided to recommend the abolition of ten battalions of the Line, and I tried to describe that rumour correctly as a '<i>nidus equinus</i>,' which is a polite and classic way of calling it a mare's nest. If I had decided to do anything of that kind it would have been, in military eyes, tantamount to insanity."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00327">In the following month, however, the noble Viscount not only changed his own mind, but persuaded all the members of the Army Council that a course which in March seemed an act of insanity had in April become an inspired policy of Army reorganisation. The noble Viscount then, having decided in April, 1906, to adopt that policy which in the previous March he and his military advisers had considered tantamount to insanity, proceeded to assure us at Newcastle in the following September that&#x2014;
<quote>"The first step towards doing something effective for developing the national basis of the Army is to cut something off superfluous Regular forces."</quote>
It seemed that the noble Viscount had come to the conclusion that the superfluity in the Regular Army, from which as an essential preliminary in military reorganisation something must be cut off, resided principally in the Infantry, both Guards and Line. The noble Viscount therefore deleted nine Infantry battalions from the Army List, sent a tenth abroad pending disbandment, and reduced the establishment of all Line battalions on the Home and Colonial List.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00328">We naturally assumed, with apparent good reason, when the nine battalions of infantry disappeared from the Army List in 1906 and 1907, when the establishment of Infantry battalions on the Colonial List had been reduced by 80 men per battalion and those on the Home List by 30 men per battalion, and when men were in process of disappearing from the Garrison and Mountain Artillery, that we must presently see a diminution of the numbers serving with the Colours in the Regular Army. But, on the contrary, after two years, the noble Viscount assured us in November, 1908, that&#x2014;
<quote>"So far from the Regular Army having been cut down, we are to-day 90,000 stronger."</quote>
Now, my Lords, I submit that the only conclusion which the country could come to from that statement was that not only
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0078"/>
<col>105</col>
had there been no reduction in the numbers of the Regular Army, but that on the other hand 90,000 Regular soldiers&#x2014;that is to say, men serving with the Colours&#x2014;had been added to its strength. Then, again, when speaking in the City of London in November, 1908, the noble Viscount is reported to have said that&#x2014;
<quote>"There was no greater fallacy than to suppose that the Government Lad reduced the Regular Line."</quote>
But the Army List told us that nine battalions of Regular Infantry had been disbanded, and Regimental Establishments for 1905 and 1911 showed us that the establishment of all Infantry Battalions on the Home and Colonial List had been reduced. How, then, can it be a fallacy to suppose that the Regular Line had not been reduced?</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00329">The noble Viscount, when be came to deal with the Army Estimates on March 15, 1911, stated that&#x2014;
<quote>"The real reduction is 25,074, which is the number of Regulars which have been disbanded between 1905 and now."</quote>
A year before&#x2014;in 1910&#x2014;in an article which I had published in the Press, I mentioned that the reductions in the Regular Army would amount, according to War Office figures, to more than 34,000 men as compared with 1905. When the noble Viscount quoted last year 25,074 as the correct number, I assumed that I had been guilty of misleading the public mind by exaggerating figures concerning our military weakness&#x2014;a practice most mischievous in the eyes of the noble Viscount, and one against which he once gave me a most solemn warning in your Lordships' House. I can assure the noble Viscount that I most cordially agree with him as to the value of accuracy in our Army statistics, and deprecate most strongly the practice of exaggerating not only the weakness of our military forces but their strength. The latter is the more dangerous practice. I So it was a real relief to me when on April 27 last the noble Viscount published a Return, which is the one I quote in detail on the Paper of the House, comparing the number of men serving with the Colours in the various branches of the Regular Army on January 1, 1905, and on January 1, 1911. From this Return it appears that the difference is 32,706. But to this figure must be added 4,242, the number of the Permanent Staff of the
<col>106</col>
Militia in 1905, all of whom were men serving on Army attestation and belonging to the Regular Army, making a total reduction of 36,948.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00330">The noble Viscount's account of the increase and decrease of the Regular Army from 1906 to 1910 is interesting chiefly for its variation, but as it is already a matter of past history I shall not trouble the noble Viscount to go back beyond the Army Estimates of last year. Then the noble Viscount stated that the real reduction was 25,074 but accepted the responsibility for a reduction of only 20,000 men from the Colours&#x2014;"no more and no less," I think was his expression. How or why an additional 16,948 more men have disappeared from the Colours of the Regular Army since 1905, apparently without any authority from the Secretary of State for War, I am not now concerned to inquire. All the country wants to know for certain is, How do we stand now, and how much weaker was the Army of 1911 than the Army of 1905? I ask the noble Viscount, therefore, to say if we may disregard all other statements concerning the increase and decrease of the men with the Colours of the Regular Army and accept the Return of April 27, 1911, as the basis of all future calculations and the numbers reduced at 36,984. I beg to ask the noble Viscount the Question standing in my name, and to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00331"><i>Moved</i>, That an humble Address be presented to His Majesty for Papers relating to the strength of the Regular Army.&#x2014;(<i>The Duke of Bedford.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00332"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL STANHOPE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I venture to think that this House is under no inconsiderable debt of gratitude to my noble friend Lord Dunmore for having brought this question forward. It has brought to light some very strange opinions. The noble Earl quoted the remarks of two Ministers of the present Government, who simply stated, in reply to Mr. Bonar Law's very grave charge, that the Government were alone responsible for the howitzer, which is the best weapon of its kind, and that they had nothing whatever to do with the field gun or with the rifle which had been brought in by a Conservative Government. I never heard a more extraordinary argument. Let me apply it to the sister Service. Suppose that, shall we say, Russia had been the first Power to invent
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0079"/>
<col>107</col>
the type of ship called the "Dreadnought." Would it have been any excuse for the First Lord of the Admiralty to say, "My Government did not build the 'King Edward' class; therefore I am not responsible for that class being now out of date?" It seems to me, and I venture to think to a good many others, that the Army is not considered either by the Secretary of State for War or by any member of the Government as being actually for use. If I may be allowed to say so without offence, as far as I can see the Secretary of State for War has not realised that the Army is for use and not merely a peg on which to hang the beatitudes.<lb/>
The mere fact that the Army is small is surely an adequate reason why it should be kept, not only abreast, but ahead of the developments in armaments and all other military preparations made by other Powers. I know nothing about the howitzer. It may be all that is claimed for it, or it may fall short of modern requirements. It is perfectly true that the field gun which we now possess is very far ahead of the gun which it displaced, but I venture to ask the noble Viscount whether the experience of the past few years has not brought out certain faults and failings in the new gun which certainly should be rectified. For instance, there is no doubt that it is certainly slower in its rate of fire than the French gun. It will not be denied that the gun is not as accurate as it might be, owing to the fact that the shock of the recoil is much more severe on the carriage of our gun than is the case with the French gun. The result is that the right gun of a battery may begin to drop a shell to the left and the left gun to the right, thus rendering observation and direction of fire by the battery commander infinitely more difficult. Then there is the further consideration of the ammunition. I believe it is still the case that we are not satisfied with our present fuze, and that the fuzes of several other Powers are ahead of ours. It is no excuse to say that it is a better fuze than it used to be. That is not the point. The point is, Is it the best fuze obtainable?<lb/>
As to the rifle, I do not altogether agree with my noble friend that the rifle was the best of its day. I do not wish to weary your Lordships with technical formul&#x00E6;. I do not believe the present rifle ever was
<col>108</col>
the best of its day. Of course, these things are very much matters of opinion, but there is not the very least doubt about it that our rifle had certain advantages over the rifle of other Powers and those advantages it possesses to the present day. One, which perhaps I might mention, is the way in which the bayonet is fixed to the wood of the rifle and not to the barrel, therefore causing less effect on the shooting. But, as several members of your Lordships' House have already pointed out, the shock of discharge, instead of being taken at the front or muzzle end of the bolt was taken at the rear of the bolt, with the result that the shock of discharge through the enormous pressure occasioned by modern ammunition travelled along the whole length of the bolt in our rifles and the steel was compressed from end to end, and a high pressure in the chamber of the rifle was rendered impossible. The result of that has been that whereas Great Britain, until this new ammunition came in, was only able to have a pressure in our rifle of 15&#x00BD; tons to the square inch, France had a pressure of 17&#x00BE;, Germany 17&#x00BD;, and the United States 19&#x00BE; tons to the square inch. We have been able to get a certain advance with our new ammunition, but so long as the rifle has to take the shock of discharge at the rear end of the bolt it is impossible to get a rifle which will give us a trajectory as low as that of other Powers.<lb/>
The height of the trajectory has been given by several speakers, and therefore I do not propose to go over that again. Perhaps I might bring out this point, that the space of ground over which a bullet is low enough to hit an Infantryman, or a man in a standing position, 1,000 yards' range, is, in the case of the German rifle, 83 yards, and, in the case of our rifle, 44 yards. Any member of your Lordships' House who has endeavoured to judge distance over a range of something approximating to 1,000 yards will know how much easier it is to get within 83 yards of the correct distance than it is to get within 44 yards. I do not know exactly the percentage, but no doubt there are experts at the War Office who will be able to inform the noble Viscount on that point. These are not my figures. They are figures taken from the Official Text Book of Small Arms published as long ago as 1909. But the position is a great deal worse than that. This was not realised by the War Office as late as 1909.
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0080"/>
<col>109</col>
The whole of these facts were known at the War Office no less than six years ago, and then, even if the facts with regard to the German rifle were not known, it was at any rate known by actual experiment what it was possible to do with the pointed bullet. In 1906 and 1907 various makers of ammunition in this country made experiments as to the shape of ballets, and in 1907 the Swift bullet, which I believe is approximately the same as the Mark VII bullet now being brought in, was invented. My Lords, I am by no means in favour of bull's-eye shooting being considered an adequate preparation for the shooting required in battle; but the greatest opponent of bull's-eye shooting has never denied that at long ranges with match rifles it is the only real test for getting at the best rifle and the best ammunition that can be found. What has the pointed bullet achieved? In 1907 it won the English Eight Club Competition; it set up a record for 800, 900, and 1,000 yards' range at the Scottish meeting; and it won with a considerable margin the Irish Eight meeting. It was used by the winner and half the competitors in the difficult Cambridge Cup, and was almost universally used for long ranges and match rifle competitions at Bisley that year. And yet in 1907, 1908, 1909, 1910 the War Office did nothing! I see that the Secretary of State denies that statement, but at any rate we are in this position, that the pointed bullet was not provided for even the Expeditionary Force of the Army and nobody apparently began to make it until last year and possibly even after the crisis of last year.<lb/>
What is the position to-day? It appears to me that it was the situation during last summer that aroused the War Office to take any action at all in this matter. They are at last moving. They have adopted the pointed bullet. How do we stand at the present moment? I believe I am correct in saying that the Expeditionary Force is even now not altogether re-armed with the rifle fitted with the new sights made necessary by the pointed bullet. I believe that will very shortly be carried out, but at the present moment the Expeditionary Force is not in a position to take the field with the new sights as required for the pointed bullet. Anyhow, the Special Reserve has not got this new rifle. Were the Special Reserve required to supply the drafts for the Expeditionary Force,
<col>110</col>
which would be required from them the moment the Expeditionary Force went abroad, there would be two sets of armaments in the field: the Special Reserve with the old rifle and the old ammunition, and the Regulars with the new rifle and the new ammunition. Anybody who has been into the question of the supply of ammunition in the field will know how endless will be the complication if you have two sets of ammunition to supply to the troops.<lb/>
Then what about the Territorial Force? Apparently it has not been even considered that the Territorial Force should be re-armed with the new rifle at all&#x2014;at any rate, the re-armament has not yet begun. Perhaps that is a very unimportant point seeing that the Report of the Inspector-General of the Forces on the Territorial Force, to which the noble Earl behind me referred, made no mention whatever of the shooting of the Territorial Force. Apparently it is considered such a trifle that it is not necessary to include it, but that it is of far more importance to put in tittle-tattle about the doings of the National Service League. I venture to think there is not one member of the National Service League who would be so misguided as to say that the shooting of the Territorial Force is not worth being dealt with in the Annual Report of the Inspector-General.<lb/>
Now I come to the point as to how the new Mark VII bullet compares with the German bullet which was brought in in 1906, or possibly in 1905. At 800 yards the highest point of its trajectory, as has been stated by several noble Lords, is 8 ft. 6 ins. as compared to the German 6 ft. 10 ins. But that is not the whole of the story. Our bullet compares unfavourably with the German bullet in almost every single particular. Its time of flight is longer, and it has less striking energy and less velocity. That, I believe, is true at every range at which the two bullets have vet been tested. With fixed sights our rifle will hit a man standing up to 700, the German rifle up to 740 yards. With fixed sights a man lying down will be hit up to 400 yards with our rifle, with the German rifle up to 450. And so far as we have gone at present it has been found that the new bullet jams in our rifle when used in magazine firing. Thanks to the War Office having only brought in this
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0081"/>
<col>111</col>
bullet as lately as last month, or at any rate the end of last year, I do not believe one per cent. of the men of the Expeditionary Force have yet used the rifle with the new sights and the new ammunition. We are told that the new rifle is shortly to be issued. I can only hope that "shortly" in this case will not be seven years hence, but will mean, what it is usually understood in ordinary conversation, a question of months.<lb/>
My Lords, I venture to hope that the new rifle will not be a compromise, as I believe the old rifle was, in order that the machinery which turned out the old rifle might be utilised as far as possible for the construction of the new one, and that a good deal that is now incorporated in our rifle will be dispensed with at the first available moment. It has been said constantly by manufacturers that it is not worth while endeavouring to bring forward any new inventions. They say that officials at the War Office take the best part of the invention of one manufacturer, another part from another, and a third part from the invention of somebody else, and that by putting all those parts together they get an excellent article, but the result is that the unfortunate manufacturer who has spent his brains, his energy, and, naturally, a considerable amount of money in endeavouring as far as possible to perfect an invention gets no reward whatever for the services he has actually rendered to his country. I do hope, therefore, that the Government will see their way to give some sort of subsidy to firms in order to endeavour to bring forward inventions such as are required. To give a case in point, I believe that most rifle experts are of opinion that an aperture sight would be a great advantage. The difficulty at present is that there is not an aperture sight on the market which can be set with rapidity and accuracy, and that if it does fulfil those conditions the aperture sight has projections and disadvantages when fitted to a rifle, which is not only a shooting weapon but is also used for drill and still more is actually the handle for the modern pike. If some inducement were offered to manufacturers to bring forward inventions dealing with these requirements we should get a good deal of competition, and British manufacturers would, I think, be able to meet the problem in a satisfactory manner.<lb/>
<col>112</col>
There is yet another thing that the country will desire to know. Who is responsible for the fact that our Army has been equipped for six long years with a rifle and ammunition not up to modern requirements? Technically it is unquestionably the Secretary of State&#x2014;actually it is nobody. By the Order in Council of August 10, 1904 the Secretary of State is responsible to Parliament, and I suppose to the country, for all the business of the Army Council. I believe that the military members of the Army Council have interpreted that literally, and have not held themselves responsible to the country for the condition of the Army as have the Sea Lords for the Fleet. The result has been that whereas the old War Office building has been a grave for the reputation of more than one Secretary of State, the new War Office, or the new policy, has been the grave for the reputations of the majority of those officers who have become military members of the Army Council. So long as the military members of the Army Council are not prepared to take the responsibility for the equipment and the details of an important matter such as this, so long must they incur any odium when it is discovered that matters are not so good as they might be.<lb/>
Twenty years ago a Memorandum used to be laid on the Table of the House, signed by the Commander-in-Chief, stating that in his opinion the Army was in an efficient and satisfactory condition. The Secretary of State who abolished that Paper was responsible for his Government being thrown out of office on the Cordite Vote. I venture to think that this debate will have proved that it is impossible for any civilian Secretary of State to have at his fingers ends all the details of the technical requirements necessary to an Army in war. It is for the General Staff to say what is required; it is for the other military members of the Army Council to supply those requirements. If this debate has done nothing more, it will have done incalculable service if it has proved that, even with a Secretary of State as able and as energetic as the noble Viscount, the present position is impossible, and that the time has come when the military members of the Army Council should be required to sign a statement that their respective departments are in a condition to fulfil the policy put before them by the Secretary of State for War.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00333"><sup>*</sup><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the debate has ranged over a variety of topics, and it will probably be convenient that I should deal with them in a somewhat different order from the order in which they have been taken. The noble Earl who has just sat down devoted a good deal of his interesting speech to the question of the rifle, and I think it will be convenient if I begin with the question of armaments. Reference has been made in the speeches of more than one noble Lord to an article which appeared in <i>The Times</i> by its Military Correspondent, Colonel Repington, and it has been suggested that Colonel Repington, somehow or other, was infringing some rule which should have prevented him from writing articles in <i>The Times</i> while he was in the service of the War Office. Let me say at once that the first I saw of that article was after it had appeared in <i>The Times.</i> I believe Colonel Repington's preparation of it was done entirely on his own initiative. I confess that I read the article with very great interest, because it is an article by one of the most brilliant writers on military subjects in this or any other country. At the same time the War Office has not the advantage of having him on its staff. He is not a War Office official, he has no allotted room or office at the War Office, but he is simply acting as the editor of the new Military Review. We asked him to undertake that post because, as I have said, we consider him one of the most brilliant military writers and one of the best informed minds on the subject of armies at home or abroad at the present time. I think we have been very fortunate in securing his services as editor of the <i>Army Review</i>, but in editing that review he is in no way in a position to control or to interfere with or to obtain access to any documents except those which the Chief of the General Staff chooses to entrust to him for the purposes of his researches. But to suggest that somehow or other he is a War Office official influenced by political partisanship in "backing me up," as one noble Lord said, in his writings is really very far from the mark. I have the honour of knowing Colonel Repington, and I frequently have had the advantage of asking his opinion on questions of difficulty, which he is always ready to give me. But to this hour I do not know what his politics are. I never talked to him about his politics, I know nothing of them, but I am informed that he is a very strong Unionist.</membercontribution></p>

I brought no accusation against the author of the article in question, but what I wanted to know was whether he was in receipt of public money.

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00335"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: As I have said, Colonel Repington is editor of the <i>Army Review</i>, and as such he receives &#x00A3;500 a year, but he writes independently in <i>The Times</i> and elsewhere; and I have as frequently felt the weight of his criticism as I have been fortunate enough to obtain some praise from him. But as for having any power or influence with him, or having anything to do with inspiring his articles, nothing is more remote from the facts. I cannot say what effect the work he has undertaken for the <i>Army Review</i> may have on his mind, but I should say very little, because he is one of the most independent men I know.<lb/>
Now I turn to the more serious question of the armaments of the Army&#x2014;the rifle, the field gun, and the howitzer. The advice which I have received from those most competent to judge is that the British Army is to-day, on the average&#x2014;that is, if you take all the qualities of all the weapons together&#x2014;as well armed as any Army in the world. Our field gun is much superior to the field gun of the German Army. Whether it is as good in every respect as the French field gun is a matter in regard to which there is a great deal of difference of opinion. A good many people think that in some points, which were touched upon in the speech of the noble Earl, the French gun has advantages, but in other respects our gun has advantages also. It is a very powerful gun, and with the possible exception of the French gun it is better than the gun of any Continental countries where military organisation has reached a very high stage. Our howitzer is by far the best in the world. There is no other howitzer that can be contrasted with it. It has been perfected and brought up to date during the past few years, and, speaking from experience, a very difficult job it has been, and we are watching every improvement made in the field guns of other countries with a view
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0083"/>
<col>115</col>
to adapting them to our own gun if desirable.<lb/>
Now I come to the rifle. The French rifle dates back, I think, to 1896, the German Mauser to 1898, and our own short rifle, which carried on the principle of the Lee-Enfield but was a new rifle, dates back to about 1903. I cannot help thinking that the noble Field-Marshal has been a little too critical of his own child. He took a great pride in the short rifle when it came out, and I really think his child is more worthy of him than he thinks. It is true that it is inferior with respect to trajectory to other rifles; but it has also some very great advantages. Because of its superior mechanical arrangements it is capable of being fired from the shoulder much more easily and much more frequently than the Continental rifle. It has this advantage, that you can fire nearly double the number of rounds out of it that you can with the German rifle, which has to be brought down from the shoulder so frequently. The noble Earl opposite referred to the jamming of the new cartridge. It is quite true that at an early stage, when we were experimenting with new ammunition, there were difficulties in extraction during rapid fire; it is hoped to overcome this difficulty. Another point is that the heavy bullet is more effective at a long range. It is an elementary proposition in mathematics that the lighter the bullet the greater the muzzle velocity, but the more quickly it comes to the ground with its momentum gone, for its energy is soon spent. I remember an eminent expert once telling me that he could make a shell of aluminium which would have the greatest muzzle velocity of any shell in the world, but it would fall into the sea about half a mile from the muzzle, and even although the German bullet has immense muzzle velocity and very fiat trajectory at a long range, it is not as useful a rifle as the noble Field-Marshal's.<lb/>
It has been truly observed that science marches on, and it is true that ours is not so good a rifle as it was originally. Times have changed. I agree that at the time, in 1903, when the pattern of the new rifle was adopted after great study by the noble Viscount opposite and the noble Field-Marshal, it was a great pity that opportunity was not taken to enlarge the breech-chamber. If the breech-chamber had been
<col>116</col>
enlarged we could have done what French and Germans have done&#x2014;that is, put in a cartridge with a larger amount of powder. The difficulty of this rifle is that it is the most modern of the three rifles. It is young and new compared to what the French have, and even what the Germans have, and we did not like to throw it aside hurriedly, particularly as new improvements were coming, so we set ourselves to work to get more powder into it consistently with the chamber being a small breech-chamber. I have personally taken a deep interest in the question of powders. I had the good fortune to be appointed by the noble Marquess opposite a member of the Explosives Committee, and I came to know something about powder at that time. Since then I have been in close consultation with the experts about what we could do to get over the defect of the smallness of the breech-chamber of the present short rifle, and the conclusion we came to was that the great improvements which have taken place in cordite have helped us materially. To begin with, we now have modified cordite which is a better cordite than the cordite we used to have&#x2014;the old Mark I cordite. In the second place, we have learnt how to make the cordite tubular. Instead of having it in flakes or cords, it is now in small hollow tubes with very small bore. The burning capacity also is very much improved, and you get out of the same quantity of cordite much more available energy. I say available because time of burning is a factor which enters largely into these things. We have been able by adopting tubular cordite to get a larger charge than we otherwise could of cordite, which burns its substance away into the gas which produces the ballistic force. The result is that we have got a considerable way on in improving the small rifle.<lb/>
The noble Earl opposite gave very nearly accurately&#x2014;I do not quarrel with him ill the main&#x2014;the relative position of the rifle. I am speaking from memory, but I think I have the facts pretty accurately in my head as to the differences which the changes have made. The dangerous space at 800 yards, of course, is less if you have a high trajectory than if you have a flat trajectory. The high trajectory of the short rifle gave at the highest point of the curve 12 ft. 9 ins. That has been reduced by means of the improved cordite to 8 ft. 9 ins., which brings us within 2&#x00BD; ft.
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0084"/>
<col>117</col>
of the German highest point. I agree that is a great difference in favour of the Germans, but still it is a very substantial improvement. It brings us within less than a foot of the French rifle. And when you take into account the advantages which the short rifle possesses&#x2014;its handiness, its freedom from jamming, the fact that you can fire it from the shoulder almost continuously, resembling the action of an automatic rifle, and that our men are trained, to compensate for the high trajectory, to fire low, the sight being arranged accordingly&#x2014;all I can say is that, though I am far from claiming that the present rifle is a perfect weapon or one we should remain with, our experts, so far as I can judge, would not be in the least afraid of our going into a war with a European Power with that rifle. Its advantages are set against its disadvantages, and although we should be deficient, I admit, in the flat trajectory which other rifles possess, we have enough, and our men are so trained in the use of it that the disadvantage arising from that would be by no means so great as it seems.<lb/>
The noble Earl asked me a question about the Expeditionary Force. Four Divisions have already been armed with the new ammunition. The remaining Divisions of the Expeditionary Force and the Cavalry Division will be armed with it almost immediately. We shall then proceed to the Special Reserve, and so on through the Army. We are taking a large provision in the Estimates of this year for the supply of the new ammunition, which will gradually supersede the old ammunition, and it is not uninteresting to know that the re-sighted rifle can fire the old ammunition. I am not suggesting that it is going to, but in an emergency you would get quite fair shooting from it at ranges up to 500 yards even with the old ammunition. I do not wish the House to suppose for a moment that we are going to do it, but that statement may relieve the apprehensions of those who think that in changing from one ammunition to another we may have diminished stocks. We shall not have, because while we are taking very large supplies of the new ammunition we are not making our old ammunition useless.<lb/>
I am not saying that we are satisfied even with that state of things. We feel
<col>118</col>
that other Powers will progress, and we have been at work for long in devising a new rifle. It has been devised and the pattern has been approved. I have seen the rifle and examined it with such care as I am capable of, and I think I may say that if this rifle, on the enlarged tests we are going to put it to, turns out to be what it promises, it will be the finest rifle in the world, both in flatness of trajectory and in every other point. Immense pains have been spent upon it. The only point about it is that it is not automatic. I do not want to go into the details of its trajectory, because that is obviously inexpedient, at present. We have not got to the stage at which these details should become public. But it is not an automatic rifle, and that point may be made against it. But I would observe that General Staffs, not only in this country but in others, are by no means agreed on the advantage of an automatic rifle. The waste of ammunition and the inaccuracy in shooting which comes from it counterbalances, in the opinion of a great many competent to judge, the advantage in the number of bullets you can send out of the muzzle in a minute of time. Moreover, with this new rifle, with very improved mechanism, with the clips and the extreme rapidity of loading, you get very near to the maximum that you can make use of in war. And therefore we are by no means disposed to wait until the rifle can be put into the automatic form. We are proceeding to the manufacture of a considerable number of these rifles which we propose to issue to selected bodies of troops to practise with for a time. We shall then have a real test, and if that does come out satisfactorily we shall go at once to the new rifle and supersede even the child of the noble Field-Marshal. The rapidity with which we shall proceed with that depends upon the success of the tests. The rifle has been shot by the experts, and we are now proceeding to the large tests which we must be satisfied with before we can take the serious step of arming the Army with a new rifle. The important thing is the new ammunition. That we have pretty nearly determined finally, and it will be in a form which will be adapted to an automatic rifle, should that come on, and our new rifle will be of a kind which can readily have automatic ammunition fitted to it. The whole question of weapons is such a difficult one, whatever Government it may be, that I should never be disposed to make many
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0085"/>
<col>119</col>
criticisms upon those who have gone before me, or, for that matter, on those who came after me. We all know how extremely difficult it is. Just when you think you have got the best thing, somebody comes forward with an entirely new thin", or a new powder, which alters the whole character of the rifle, and I think everybody ought to exercise the maximum amount of charity towards his neighbour in this difficult problem of what is the best weapon to be got.<lb/>
I pass now to the question put by the noble Duke, the Duke of Bedford. He reproached me, to begin with, for breaking a pledge in 1906. He quoted me as having said I should be almost in a lunatic condition if I reduced battalions, and said that, nevertheless, within a few weeks I proceeded to do it. What I did say, and what I was reported as having said in every newspaper, except one, and what I was certainly reported in the Official Report as having said&#x2014;and I made it perfectly plain in answers in the House of Commons&#x2014;was that I should be a lunatic if I reduced the home battalions. The home battalions were fewer in number than the battalions abroad, and what we wanted above everything was to restore the balance of the Cardwell system. I never reduced any home battalions; what I did was to reduce the battalions abroad.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00336"><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member><membercontribution>: Will the noble Viscount admit that the battalions disappeared from the "Army List." That was entirely my point.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00337">*<member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: No, that was not entirely the point. Of course they disappeared from the Army List. What the noble Duke charged me with was with violating a pledge. He spoke about the Army being 90,000 stronger than before. I never said it was. I said the number of men you could send abroad was 90,000 stronger than before, because the Militia were put under an obligation to serve abroad. The figures were available to anybody. I had occasion to complain a little last summer of some figures of the noble Duke, by which he made out that we had effected very great reductions in numbers, and I pointed out that his accountant, or whoever made out his figures for him, had made a mistake, and that the statement was some 30,000 out.
<col>120</col>
That did not prevent the statement appearing under the signature of the noble Duke But I am sure it was made before I answered that question and made the correction, a he would have been the last person to allow an inaccurate statement to appear in an Army journal to the effect that of my own admissions the figures which he had given were right. The noble Duke had doubtless sent his letter to that journal before I gave my answer in the House but it did not appear until later.<lb/>
I am put in this difficulty, that the noble Duke somehow or other almost always gets the figures wrong. He has given figures on the present occasion which he has got, if he will allow me to say so, quite wrong. He has dealt with the number of officers, and with the reductions. I will take first the point as to officers. He represents me as having stated in my Estimates speech in the House of Commons last year that we had added 2,600 to the absolute number of Regular officers in the Army during the last five years. I think I have a little reason to complain of the noble Duke's accountant. He has quoted that, not from the <i>Hansard</i> report which is on the shelves in the Library, not from the Official Report but from the rough <i>Hansard</i> which simply represents what the reporters very often at the moment cannot hear properly, and do their best to take down, and within a day or two the rough report comes to us and is corrected. On this occasion what I am reported as having said was taken from the rough report and not from the Official Report. When I said, "We have added a good deal to the establishment of Regular officers in the Army," I was referring to the extra officers added on the formation of the Special Reserve. And I went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"To day the position is that we have got, counting the Special Reserve, about 2,700 more officers at home who will be available for service abroad than we had five years ago."</quote>
I did not use the words which the noble Duke has quoted from the rough uncorrected report. What I said appears in the corrected report, and it is absolutely accurate. I was dealing with the mobilisation of the six Divisions, and the figure 2,700 is the result of a comparison between the number of officers serving in the United Kingdom and liable for service abroad&#x2014;that is the Regulars, Special Reserve and Reserve of Officers&#x2014;in
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0086"/>
<col>121</col>
December, 1905, and the number so serving in December, 1910. The Return given in the House of Commons on April 27, 1911, showed the number of Regular officers serving at home, in India, and in the Colonies on January 1, 1905, and January 1, 1911. The reduction between these dates is 131; but there is nothing in this Return inconsistent with the statement that, for the purpose of the Expeditionary Force, there are now 2,700 more officers available than there were five years ago.<lb/>
Now I come to the second point the noble Duke made. He said that the real reduction which I have made, or which the present Government have made, is 32,706 non-commissioned officers and men. That, again, is most extraordinary. It is quite clear that the noble Duke has taken the figures as from January 1, 1905, a period months before I came into office. He has got confused in that way. The figure 25,074, to which he refers, represents, as I made quite clear at the time, the difference between the establishments provided in Vote A of the Army Estimates of 1905&#x2013;6 and those provided in the Army Estimates of 1910&#x2013;11. Those establishments are for the Regular Army, exclusive of India; they include all ranks and the Permanent Staff are included in both years. If you look at the Estimates of 1905&#x2013;6 and the Estimates for 1910&#x2013;11, Vote A, you will find the figures as I have stated them now. The figure should be 25,950, not 25,074, and of those 25,950, 5,000 and more were marked for reduction by my predecessor in office in the year 1905. So far as I am concerned, and so far as the present Government are concerned, our reductions amount to about 20,000. And I need not remind the noble Duke that those include some 3,000 Chinese, Indian, and Colonial troops, and certain Garrison Artillery which had been marked for reduction by the Owen Committee, and virtually the reduction only amounted to the nine battalions of which I have spoken. As against that we can now mobilise the Artillery, which we could not do in those days, and so far as transport and other matters are concerned we are in a better position. The figure 32,706, which the noble Duke quotes, is the difference between the number of noncommissioned officers and men serving at home in India and the Colonies on January 1, 1905, and the number serving on January 1, 1911. Of this number
<col>122</col>
17,851 represents the loss of strength between January 1, 1905, and April 1, l906. I am not responsible for those. I am responsible for the reductions which I have made myself and of which I am not at all ashamed, because I think the re-shaping and re-organisation far more than compensate for the lopping off of these surplus battalions which we could not mobilise and could not use for the lack of Artillery and proper transport. What I have done at all events is represented by that figure&#x2014;the exact figure being 19,097. I said about 20,000. Of course, these figures are perfectly consistent with what is in the Return and with what I said in my speech, and the mistake of the noble Duke has arisen from whoever supplied him with the figures having committed the blunder of not noticing that on the 1st of January, 1905, it was not I who was in office but the late Mr. Arnold-Forster.<lb/>
Now I pass to the more general topic which has been discussed&#x2014;I mean the Territorial Force. I agree that it is not possible with fifteen days' training, even with the extra training far in excess of regulations which the Territorials put in, to produce a first line Army; and the question I wish to put is&#x2014;What is it you are aiming at More than a year's training is requisite if you want to produce a force which you can pit man for man against Continental troops. You must have at least two years for Infantry, and perhaps three for Artillery and possibly for Cavalry. The advice of my experts is clear as to that. They say that unless you have that training you will not get a first line Army&#x2014;that is to say, an Army which is designed to bear the shock of an equal number of troops on even terms with itself. But we never proposed the Territorial Force as a first line Army. The fallacy which lies at the root of all the misrepresentations of the scheme of defence, which is now the scheme of defence of three Governments&#x2014;the late Government, the Government of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, and the Government of Mr. Asquith&#x2014;is this. The first and second lines of the scheme of defence are naval. They rest upon command of the sea, and that is why command of the sea is vital and essential to this country. I quite admit that if we have not got command of the sea all my schemes fall to pieces. We depend absolutely upon a Fleet which can outmatch any Fleet that may be brought against it, and we depend
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0087"/>
<col>123</col>
also upon that second naval line of submarines and destroyers which is established round our coasts and against which any transports or warships which escaped the main Fleet would have an extremely difficult task. We hear speeches&#x2014;I hear them from the noble Field-Marshal&#x2014;which seem to me to ignore the naval considerations. The noble Field-Marshal spoke of the great transports which are in foreign ports not far off and their capacity for carrying troops. But it is not such an easy thing to transport troops even when you have the transports. To transport 25,000 troops took Italy three weeks, although the Italian General Staff had been making the most careful and secret preparations long before, and I should like to see the fleet of transports which would come out against the superior Fleet watching for it and against that second line of naval defence of which I have spoken. Anyhow, we have put our money upon these two naval lines.<lb/>
I deprecate the scheme of the noble Field-Marshal and of the National Service League. I am strongly opposed to it for two reasons. It does not give a first line Army, but a four or six months' trained Army, which I am advised would be useless against Continental troops on the footing of a first line Army, But I combat the hypothesis of the noble Field-Marshal because it ignores what the naval experts have laid down for us, and it is by the naval experts that we must be guided in this matter. We deliberately adopted the policy of making our first line of defence naval, and if you are going to take a great deal of money for compulsory service I think you will find yourself going short on the money you spend on the command of the sea and also upon your Oversea Army, to which I attach very great importance. I will not enter into the controversial topic of whether recruiting for the Regular Army and its necessarily voluntary system would be imperilled by a system of compulsory training. My own belief is that it would be in great peril, but I will not go into that. It is enough for me to say that if you put &#x00A3;7,000,000 or &#x00A3;8,000,000 on to the Estimates it will inevitably come off the ships and the Regular Army, and it is because I believe in the Naval doctrine of keeping command of the sea and in putting that command beyond doubt as the foundation of our strategy of defence that I am wholly opposed to the policy of the noble Field-Marshal. I
<col>124</col>
receive everything he says with respect, but I would receive it with more if he were not dealing with what is essentially a naval problem, and on which the authority of naval experts, and naval experts alone, ought to be taken.<lb/>
This goes to the root of much of the criticism that was made by the noble Earl opposite. The noble Earl said, Let us take this away from the level of mere Party politics, and unite on compulsory service. In the first place, for the reasons I have just given, I think compulsory service utterly wrong from a strategical point of view; and, secondly, I want to know who, in this nation of seamen, is going to bring it forward. Will the noble Viscount or the noble Marquess opposite bring it forward? They have never said so. The noble Earl who opened this debate is a man of great courage and perhaps he will lead a Party in favour of compulsory service, but I am bound to say that if he did so I think he would find the water very cold, and that his endeavour would have very short shrift. And I rejoice that it should be so, because I believe the real seaman's instinct in this nation points to a very different solution of the problem of defence and of the Empire. These considerations have a very great bearing upon the Territorial Force. The Territorial Force was never designed to be a first line Army. It was designed to supply an Army of much superior numbers ready to envelope and destroy what might pass through the naval network, which is the true first and second line of our defence. It does not do to rest your defence solely I on ships. Raiding parties may slip through, the figure of 70,000 was an arbitrary one, and was adopted from the figure given by the noble Earl himself. But against small raiding parties slipping through we ought to provide, and the Territorial Force is designed to make it not worth the while of anybody to try to bring such a raiding force. The scheme of coast defence is now very elaborate, and, we think, amply sufficient to make it impossible for any very large force to come. Even if it did get through in considerable numbers, such a force, I believe, would very soon be swallowed up and worn out. I think I have said enough to answer many of the criticisms made in the speech of the noble Earl, which were really founded on this, that the Territorial Force ought to be a first line Army.</membercontribution></p>

The Prime Minister has never said, and I have never suggested, that the Navy admit that 70,000 men or anything like that number will ever be able to land in this country. The very foundation of our naval strategy and the number and disposition of the ships we keep in the home waters is to make it impossible for any force numbering anything like 70,000 to land.

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00340"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I quite realise the difficulty under which the noble Viscount labours when he rises to reply to the different points brought out in speeches by men who have made a careful study of, and speak with great authority on, this subject. I cannot say that I think the effort of the noble Viscount to alleviate what is a genuine apprehension on the part of those who have spoken to-night was a very happy one, especially in the last ten or fifteen minutes of his speech. With what has the noble Viscount dealt? He has gone off at a tangent and denounced observations and opinions of the noble and gallant Field-Marshal, but he has not met the <i>substratum</i> of the case which he was asked to meet to-night&#x2014;namely, whether he has been able to bring the forces of the country up to the point that is necessary for national safety. Really when the noble Viscount, who is quite capable of a very limpid atmosphere of thought, goes off into this murky atmo-
<col>126</col>
sphere of discussion which is destined and entirely intended to enshroud and fog the real issues, I must ask permission to endeavour to bring him back again to the points that he has been asked to meet on the different subjects, none of them discursive, which we have had brought forward this evening.<lb/>
The noble Viscount was first asked to remember that the numbers of the Regular Forces were by his own confession less than when he took office, and that the training of the Auxiliary Forces was less than the Inspector-General, whom he himself appoints, considers necessary for the performance of the duties placed upon them. If I may come straight to the point as time is short, I must say that I think the noble Viscount does not really realise what is behind these discussions. I myself deeply deprecate the necessity for these continual attacks and criticisms, but they have become necessary owing to the present condition of our Army and of the War Office. The reason which actuates them at this moment is that whatever has been said from the Front Bench up till last year has received u completely fresh perspective from what occurred last September. The whole basis on which the Territorial Army has been built up has been that they would get six months' training before they would be called upon to face a foreign foe. The noble Viscount knows better than any man that the whole of what has been told us from that Bench during the last five years was changed by the attitude which His Majesty's Government found it necessary to take up last September. Never under any circumstances have we been told in this House that all the six Divisions might be sent to the Continent within a very short time. We pressed the noble Marquess the Leader of the House, before the noble Viscount became a member of it, and three of his colleagues spoke from that Bench. The result of their observations was that unless these islands were absolutely free from any fear of invasion not more than four Divisions would ever be sent abroad. I do not wish to tread on delicate ground, but everybody knows that circumstances might arise which might cause the employment of 150,000 Regulars abroad, and which would absolutely preclude the amount of training necessary for the Territorial Force on which the whole edifice of the noble Viscount's scheme is built.<lb/>

<col>127</col>
If I had time, I should like to make a slight excursion into some of the facts on which the noble Viscount has come to an issue with the noble Duke. The noble Duke is a greater master than I am of these figures. I will take two points merely to illustrate how unreliable are the noble Viscount's deductions as regards his own action. Take the case of the officers. He admits that the total number of officers is less than it was six years ago, and he then proceeds to explain that the number available to go abroad is greater than it was six years ago, and he expects us to rest content with that. We know perfectly well that the number of Regular officers must be genuinely greater in this country, and the number available to go abroad must be greater. The noble Viscount took exception to the noble Duke's assertion with regard to the number of Regulars which the noble Viscount had reduced, and he fell back, unconsciously no doubt, on a statement which I have always thought was one of the most unfair ever made with regard to a man who is not here to answer for himself&#x2014;the late Mr. Arnold-Forster. The noble Viscount says&#x2014;
<quote>"It is quite true that the number of Regular troops is less by 20,000 than it was when I took office, but 5,000 of those men were doomed to extinction by my predecessor."</quote>
The fact is entirely left out that Mr. Arnold-Forster had based the possibility of reducing the number of Regulars with the Colours upon introducing a system of short service of two years with the Colours and ten with the Reserve, which would have produced a less number of Regulars with the Colours but a much greater number of Reserves. That attempt the noble Viscount found it necessary to knock on the head as soon as he came into office. So that, whereas by Mr. Arnold-Forster's scheme we should have had 5,000 men less with the Colours but a much greater Reserve, the noble Viscount has robbed us not only of the men with the Colours and a great many more besides, but of the additional number of Reserves which would have been created.<lb/>
Realising how great and serious these issues are I was amazed to hear, if I may say so, such paltry rhetoric put before your Lordships. And we are asked to go away content with it. The same with regard to the training of the Territorial Army. Like others of your Lordships I am doing all I possibly can in my own
<col>128</col>
neighbourhood to secure recruits for the Territorial Army. We do not wish to discourage them. But really we must be allowed to try their numbers and their training by some standard, and is it unfair for that purpose to take the figures which the noble Marquess opposite said it was necessary to deal with?&#x2014;not with the force which the noble and gallant Field-Marshal thinks might land on these shores. The noble Marquess himself said that a force of 70,000 might have to be dealt with. That is the figure we took, and the training that we ask for is not the training which the noble and gallant Field-Marshal asks for, but the training which Sir John French asks for. When we find that the Territorial Army is 60,000 short of the figures of the noble Viscount; that it is dwindling to some extent or is hardly being maintained; and that, by a document not put before us until twelve months after it has been in the hands of the War Office, the training is denounced by the Inspector-General, I think we have a Tight to ask that the noble Viscount should keep to that point and not go off to statements about the Fleet being our first line of defence&#x2014;statements from which we have never dissented. All we ask him to do is to provide against the number of troops who are likely to laud on these islands, which the noble and gallant Field-Marshal tells us we are not at present in a position to do.<lb/>
I will say one word with regard to the rifle. The noble Viscount showed clearly that the question of the ammunition at this moment is most important. He explained why the rifle adopted in 1903 was not capable of firing the exact ammunition which would give it the lowest trajectory and the greatest velocity. I do not in the least quarrel with anything he said about the rifle, but I think we have some little cause to complain of the publicity given by his colleague, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to a charge that under the noble and gallant Field-Marshal and his predecessors a rifle was adopted which was quite unlit for the troops. The field gun has been vindicated, and in all these matters we come back to our old quarrel with the noble Viscount&#x2014;a quarrel which was admirably phrased by my noble friend Lord Stanhope, when he said that the noble Viscount seemed to look upon the Army as "a peg on which to hang beatitudes." The remarks of four or five members of your Lordships' House who
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0090"/>
<col>129</col>
have spoken this evening in a handsome and appreciative mariner of the Military Critic of <i>The Times</i> must have proved to the noble Viscount that the bland and child-like innocence with which he tells the House that an officer chosen to fill a high post under the Chief of the General Staff at the War Office is likely to indulge in as pungent and pointed criticism of the Secretary of State as a man who has no connection either with the Secretary of State or the Department over which he presides, is one of those points which must go side by side with the noble Earl's epigram. Not only does the noble Viscount look upon the Army as a peg on which to hang beatitudes, but I fear he believes that the one duty that a Secretary of State has to carry out is to ply the public with sedatives, and in this House to ply your Lordships with generalities when he has been pinned down by some of the best experts to facts and figures.<lb/>
That is my quarrel with the noble Viscount, and I would even now appeal to him that he will not leave us as he has done in this debate. We know that the number of our Regular Forces has been, unwisely in our opinion, decreased. We know that we have not got enough Regular Officers, and that the Auxiliary Forces are not fit to carry out the work which the noble Viscount himself has insisted should be entrusted to them. Yet we are asked to go away from here to-night, as we have been asked before, without the admission of a single defect by the Secretary of State, without the promise of looking into one point with regard to the <i>personnel</i> or of an endeavour to amend it in the direction advocated by every critic and by every noble Lord who has spoken on this side of the House. That cannot be satisfactory to us. It does not lead to conviction, and in the end will result in gradually turning into impatient critics all those who are earnestly anxious in the interests of the country to see success crown the efforts which the noble Viscount has made and the scheme for which he has laboured so hard.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00341"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (THE MARQUESS OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have no intention of endeavouring to cover anything like the wide field over which this debate has so far travelled.
<col>130</col>
It is only because my name has been mentioned by the noble Viscount opposite that I rise to say a word upon the one I point of the often quoted figure of 70,000 men of a hostile force who are supposed to be able to land on these shores. I think it is necessary to make some caution I with regard to this figure, because the figure of 70,000 is now sometimes rather airily spoken of as though it were an agreed figure of a hostile force which at any time, not as a sequel to a sea fight, but at any time might make its appearance on these shores, and which would have to be met by the Territorial Force. I think the figure of 70,000 was originally mentioned by the then Prime Minister, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, in another place, and the I way in which it came to be mentioned, so I far as I recollect, was this. When we were discussing the whole question of invasion in relation to the inquiries made by my noble and gallant friend on the Cross Benches, the conclusion arrived at was that, perfect though the means employed by the Admiralty might be of stopping an invasion, yet it could not be on any showing certain that some forces, of the type which it has been convenient to describe as "raids," might not slip through; and it was held, at any rate for the sake of argument, that two such forces might possibly, in such circumstances, avoid the Fleet. Then we had discussions as to the figure at which a raid might be possible. I think that in the original definition of a raid supplied by Mr. Balfour when these matters were first discussed the figure was put at 5,000 men, but it was afterwards held that, owing to the increase in the size of transports and for other reasons, that number ought to be increased, and it was then put at from 12,000 to 15,000, or even 17,000 men. It was assumed, as I say for the sake of argument, that two such raids might conceivably effect a landing on different parts of the United Kingdom, and in order to be thoroughly on the safe side the maximum number of men comprised in those two raids was doubled and so it reached the figure of 70,000, and that perfectly arbitrary figure was therefore taken as the force against which the Territorial Army ought in an extreme case to be able to provide. That, so far as I know, is the origin of what I may venture to call the quite arbitrary figure of 70,000, and although I do not protest at all against that figure being used, I do protest very strongly against its being taken as what I venture
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0091"/>
<col>131</col>
to call an agreed figure representing a force which a hostile European Power could at any time place in one body on our shores and which the Territorial Army would have to meet.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00342"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I desire to say a very few words in reply to the noble Viscount. Would the noble Viscount kindly tell me whether the figures in the Return of April 27, 1911, are correct or not. The figures I have given are not my own figures; they are the figures in that Return, and they show a difference between 1905 and 1911 of 36,948 men.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00343"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: Yes, the Return is quite correct. But the whole point is that the noble Duke has taken the 1st of January, 1905, as the date from which I am responsible, and I was not in office at that time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00344"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member><membercontribution>: I am not concerned with who is responsible. My point is that the Regular Army has been reduced by 36,948 men. There were that number fewer serving in the Army in 1911 than in 1905, and if that is so I should like to point out some of the many consequences that will ensue. In the first place, if you reduce the Army by 37,000 men you want far fewer recruits. Your recruiting problem ought, therefore, to be much easier, and all your establishments in future ought easily to be kept up to full strength. Another thing that is absolutely inevitable if yon reduce the Army by 37,000 men is that your Reserves must be also reduced. You cannot have the one without the other. This also is certain, that if you reduce the Army by nearly 37,000 serving soldiers it is all nonsense to go on talking about the Army of the future being stronger than the Army of 1905. One of the very last utterances of the noble Viscount concerning Army reductions was made in December last, and it is a most important one. The noble Viscount was then commenting on a letter written by the noble and gallant Field-Marshal Lord Roberts on national defence, and the noble Viscount is reported to have said, in reference to the reductions of the Regular Army, that he had merely lopped off those useless branches which contributed nothing to the trunk. I doubt very much whether the audience who heard the noble Viscount, or even those of your Lordships who read the report of the noble Viscount's speech,
<col>132</col>
realised what had happened, and what those branches really were. What the noble Viscount had really done was this. During his tenure of office 5,686 noncommissioned officers and men disappeared from the Garrison and Mountain Artillery. Nine Regular battalions disappeared from the Army List, and altogether 36,948 men disappeared from the Army. If the Government have been advised, as I suppose they have, by the Committee of Imperial Defence that the Regular Army is too big for the needs of Imperial Defence, and have accordingly reduced the numbers, that is a matter; of policy on which I offer no criticism. But what I do protest most emphatically against is this, that the Secretary of State for War should have said that all he had done in regard to reducing the Army was to lop off those branches which contributed nothing at all to the trunk, the fact being that during his term of office 36,948 men have disappeared from the Regular Army. As the noble Viscount has given me the information I wanted&#x2014;namely, that this is the correct number of men who have disappeared from the Army&#x2014;I beg to withdraw my Motion.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE HOME RULE MEETING AT BELFAST.</title>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00346"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I move for a Return of the Military and Civil Forces which were specially detached to Belfast in connection with the recent meeting addressed by the First Lord of the Admiralty, and of the cost thereby incurred. The hour is late, but I must ask to be allowed for a few moments to recall to your Lordships' minds the events which occurred immediately preceding that meeting. It had, of course, been for long notorious that the Government intended in the present session to bring in a Home Rule Bill, and therefore it caused considerable surprise in Ireland and no doubt great surprise everywhere else when an announcement appeared in the first days of January that the First Lord of the Admiralty would, on February 8, only five days before the meeting of Parliament, address a meeting in Belfast in favour of Home Rule. One was naturally puzzled to imagine what could be the object of such meeting. We hoped that we were
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0092"/>
<col>133</col>
immediately to see this Home Rule Bill. That pleasure, which I suppose is only deferred, was, we thought, on the point of being vouchsafed to as. But, ray Lords, the surprise was much greater when it was announced that the First Lord of the Admiralty proposed to hold this meeting in the Ulster Hall, in the centre of the Protestant quarter, knowing, as he must have known, the opinion of the Protestants with regard to this question.<lb/>
Now, everybody knows that the feeling of the loyalists in Ulster is extremely bitter on this question of Home Rule. They have made some very strong declarations; they have said that they would never submit to a Home Rule Parliament, and other things of that kind, and they have been taunted by many speakers on Government platforms that these were mere words and that they would not dare act up to their declarations. When they saw that it had just been resolved to deliver a lecture on Home Rule in the Ulster Hall, is it to be wondered at that they were extremely indignant and ultimately resolved that the meeting should not take place in that hall? For some days there was every prospect of riot and bloodshed, and for some days the First Lord of the Admiralty persevered in his intention to address this meeting in the Ulster Hall. But after some further consideration and some meetings in London, at which I noticed the Master of Elibank (the Government Whip), and representatives of the Ulster Liberal Association were present, it was at last determined that they had better hold the meeting somewhere else, and on January 25 Mr. Winston Churchill wrote to Lord Londonderry&#x2014;
<quote>"As I now gather from the newspapers that the main objection of yourself and your friends is directed against, our holding the meeting in the Ulster Hall, I will, although I think that such claims are neither just nor reasonable, ask the Ulster Liberal Association to accede to your wishes."</quote>
The First Lord of the Admiralty must, indeed, be very simple if he was not aware from the very first of what the consequences of this proposal to use the Ulster Hall for this purpose would necessarily be, but it is only fair to say that he has repudiated and disclaimed all responsibility for the choice of the Ulster Hall and thrown the responsibility upon the Ulster Liberal Association.<lb/>
<col>134</col>
The chairman of that association is Lord Pirrie, who also was chairman of the meeting when it was ultimately held. I regret to say that owing to illness he is I not able to be here to-night, and therefore I shall abstain from making certain remarks and from asking certain questions which I certainly should have put to him if he had been present, because I think that any member of your Lordships' House who knows Belfast as Lord Pirrie knows it&#x2014;he has been Lord Mayor of Belfast, and is, perhaps, the most prominent citizen in Belfast&#x2014;will agree with me in venturing to think that when he allowed his name to be used as chairman of the Ulster Liberal Association for such a purpose as this, and at such a moment, he incurred&#x2014;whether it was Lord Pirrie or other members of the association who authorised the announcement I do not know&#x2014;a very culpable, and, indeed, almost criminal responsibility. The manifest and only result that could follow, knowing what Belfast is and what these times are, was riot, and probably bloodshed. However, wiser counsels prevailed, and the meeting was shifted to the Celtic Football Ground.<lb/>
I suppose it was the municipality of Belfast who in these circumstances thought it necessary to apply for forces to protect them, and a small army was drafted into Belfast. Happily, no rioting occurred; but this remains, that the cost of that army has to be paid. By whom is that cost going to be paid? Is it by the ratepayers of Belfast, or is it to come out of the Exchequer of the country? I do not know what happens in Ireland, but if it were in England I believe that the cost would be borne by the Exchequer. Sometimes Ireland is treated, as we know, much more favourably than we are here. But here is this bill, and it has to be met. What have we gained for the money? In the first place, we have had the inestimable advantage of a speech from Mr. Winston Churchill which leaves us very little wiser, indeed I may say not one whit wiser, than we were before. He informed us, first of all, that Ireland was not only going to call upon us to establish a separate Parliament there, but was also going to ask us to make a grant of money with which to establish that Parliament. That is an old friend. Then, in the second place, British credit is to be used for the advantage of Ireland, and what are known as "all British obligations" are to be met. Lastly, those old
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0093"/>
<col>135</col>
guarantees were trotted out and passed over the stage. We all know what the value of those guarantees is. That was all that was contained in his speech. Next, we had the advantage of a speech from Mr. John Redmond, and he, of course, agreed with every single word that Mr. Churchill said. We all know Mr. John Redmond and his style of talking, and it does not follow because he says a thing one day that he will not say very nearly the opposite a few days afterwards as it suits his purpose. Lastly, there was a speech from Mr. Joseph Devlin, and by way of illustrating the reconciliation and the harmony which is to prevail under Home Rule that speech was simply a violent attack upon my noble friend here and the other leaders of his Party. That is all we got for this bill.<lb/>
Now with regard to Mr. Churchill's mission, was that mission authorised by the Cabinet? I suppose it was. We know that there are one or two Ministers in the present Cabinet who are very fond of hearing their own voices, and who sometimes appear on public platforms and give utterance to speeches and sentiments which I do not think always convey very great comfort to their colleagues. But unless it was one of those occasions, one must suppose that this mission was authorised by the Cabinet. If so, what did the Cabinet expect to get by it? What have they got by it? Did they expect to make any converts to Home Rule? All that they have done, so far as I can see, is to embitter and increase the feeling of detestation on the part of loyalists to Home Rule, and to fortify and confirm their intention to oppose it to the utmost of their power, I beg leave to move for the Return.</membercontribution></p>

<title>INDIA.</title>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00361"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member> rose to call attention to the policy of His Majesty's Government with regard to the removal of the capital of India to Delhi, and other connected matters; and to move for Papers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00362">The noble Earl said: My Lords, I think I had better begin by an apology for the unconscionable strain that I am afraid I shall place upon the patience of your Lordships. But it is not possible to deal briefly with every aspect of this great case. The decision which I am about to discuss is by far the most important that has been come to since the Government of India was taken over by the Crown. It is not merely a question of moving the capital from Calcutta to Delhi, or of redistributing boundaries of Provinces containing nearly 100 millions of people in the Eastern parts of India; it is a question raising great issues which must profoundly affect your rule in India for all time.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00363">It was on December 12 last that the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, told us in this House of the new and far-reaching steps which had been announced that morning at Delhi by His Majesty the King,
<col>138</col>
and commended them to the consideration of this House. It is no secret, my Lords, that we were all taken by surprise. My noble friend Lord Lansdowne and myself had only heard of this fact a few hours in advance, and though he and I had been jointly responsible for the Government of India for a period of twelve years, though there were other ex-Viceroys in this country who had been similarly responsible for another ten years, though our joint knowledge of India, and our responsibility for its government in the highest place had thus covered a period of twenty-two years, I believe I am right in saying that not one of us had been consulted in advance or had the slightest inkling of what was going to be done. I make no complaint of that. His Majesty's Government are entitled to consult or not to consult whomever they please. But I think it should be known that this step was taken on the initiative of a Viceroy&#x2014;I speak of him with respect because he is a personal friend&#x2014;who had only been in India a few months, of a Secretary of State who had not enjoyed his great position for a longer period, and without any reference to those officers who had been responsible for the Government of India for a period of nearly a quarter of a century. Lord Lansdowne on that occasion described this departure as one of the utmost gravity. He said that we ought not hurriedly to pass judgment upon it, but that we retained our right of free criticism at a later date. Since then neither he nor I have said one word in public about this matter. While the King was in India it appeared unbecoming to us that any note of discord should mar the triumphant effect of His Majesty's progress.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00364">Here may I say how cordially and respectfully I endorse what was said on this matter by the Leaders on both sides of the House in the debate on the Address a few days ago? I truly believe that no British Monarch ever rendered a greater service to India or any part of his Dominions than did His Majesty by the conception and execution of his tour. I say the conception, because everybody knows that the idea was His Majesty's own, to which he adhered in spite of the advice given him by many well qualified to pronounce; and I say the execution, because although the fullest credit ought to be given to those in India who were responsible for the detail and the ceremonial of
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0095"/>
<col>139</col>
a visit which appears to have passed off almost without a hitch, yet it is indisputable that the main success was due to the personality of their Majesties themselves, who succeeded in persuading the Princes and the peoples of India that they were not only paying their homage to their Sovereigns in a great and stately ceremonial, but that they were meeting those who felt for them a sincere and profound regard.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00365">And if there is one point in His Majesty's tour to which I would beg leave to call passing attention, it is to the utterances of His Majesty himself. I do not believe that a series of speeches was ever made by a Monarch or by any British public man characterised by a deeper insight, a more balanced and felicitous choice of words, or a more genuine feeling. When His Majesty ended by that message of hope which he gave to the peoples of India as a sort of watchword for their future progress, he struck a note which vibrated in the heart of every man, not merely who heard it but who read it in any part of the Empire, and he expressed an aspiration that every one of us deeply trusts will be realised in the days that are to come. Nothing that I may say this afternoon about the announcement which was placed in the lips of the King can in the least degree affect my profound and respectful recognition of the service rendered by His Majesty in India to India and to the Empire.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00366">The question, however, may be raised whether the action of the Sovereign, irrevocable as we have been told it is, should debar us from any criticism upon it. I am as alive as any man to the value of imagination in your Eastern policies, and to the importance of ruling the East, not by cut-and-dried formuh&#x00E6;, but by an appeal to sentiment and to feeling. I know how moved Oriental Peoples are by a supreme manifestation of Royal power, and therefore I of all people am not blind to the spectacular and dramatic effects of such a scene as was witnessed at Delhi. And yet, my Lords, I have no doubt whatever as to the answer which ought to be given to my own question. It would not be right that even in India the personal authority of the Sovereign should be engaged to relieve his Ministers of the responsibility which is theirs, to supersede Parliament, which is the governing authority
<col>140</col>
as regards India and every portion of His Majesty's Dominions, or to shut the mouths of public men. For surely it is clear that if you once accept the principle that great political and administrative changes can be introduced in India by the <i>fiat</i> of the Sovereign, even on the occasion of his Coronation, without challenge, you impair and weaken the Constitutional machinery which we have set up in this country and which we regard as the guarantee of our liberties. You set up an autocracy which is not the more tolerable, but the less tolerable because the Ministers who really exercise it shelter themselves behind the person of the Sovereign. You establish a precedent which might in the future be followed on occasions other than a Coronation. You might, indeed, tempt succeeding Sovereigns to go one better than their predecessors, or in the inverse case you might compel the Sovereign to desist from going to India to celebrate his Coronation at all because he had no dramatic or commanding boon to give. These results, I think, might ensue from our silent acceptance of what has been done. No doubt it would be much easier and much pleasanter for us on this side to say nothing at all, but if we held our peace we might be suspected of acquiescence in the course that has been adopted, and we might encourage its repetition in the future. That is the reason, my Lords, why we are compelled to raise this question to-day. Nothing that will be said here will be in any degree disrespectful to the action of the Sovereign. It is the action of his Ministers that is our concern. It is their advice to the Sovereign that we impugn. Indeed the King himself made it perfectly clear at Delhi, because he used the words that it was upon the advice of his Ministers that he was taking action.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00367">What is the <i>gravamen</i> of our charge against Ministers? For the moment I say nothing about the policy itself. I speak only of its matter and its method. They decided upon a course the importance of which they would be the last to deny. It was a course involving the uprooting of traditions in India which had existed for 150 years. It involved not merely the shifting of the capital, but the creation of a new capital. It included the reversal, either entire or partial, of a great administrative act of their predecessors. It entailed the carving about of great Provinces in a part of India. All these steps
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0096"/>
<col>141</col>
were decided upon in secret without consultation with those whom you ordinarily consult in India, without any intimation to representative bodies or persons, without any consultation of public opinion, behind the back of Parliament. Then you give finality to this procedure, you invest it with a sacrosanct character by putting it into the mouth of the Sovereign&#x2014;not in a King's Speech or in any manner with which we may be familiar in this country, but on an occasion when the King utters a solemn pledge, a pledge invested with almost sacramental solemnity, to the representatives of 300,000,000 of his people in India. Is it possible to imagine a procedure more contrary to the established usage of our Constitution, less consonant with our democratic practice?</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00368">Look at the results of your action. In the first place, you use your advantage to relieve yourselves of all opposition till it is too late, and of all criticism until it must necessarily be ineffective. Then you place us, the Opposition, in the embarrassing position of reviewing what is already an accomplished act. You institute what is a new procedure in the history of British rule in India. Hitherto no great change has taken place in the Government of India without full discussion in Parliament and the sanction of both Houses. This was the case with Pitt's Act in 1784, with the various Charter Acts of 1793, 1813, 1833, and 1853, with the Government of India Act under which the Crown took over the Government of India in 1858, and with Lord Beaconsfield's Royal Titles Act in 1876. Every one of those measures was debated at length in both Houses of Parliament. Some of us are old enough to remember that the Party opposite distinguished themselves by their frantic hostility to Mr. Disraeli's far-sighted measure giving to Queen Victoria the title of Empress of India. But Mr. Disraeli, as he then was, although he was an Imperial statesman, was also a Constitutional Minister. He did not make his announcement at a Durbar, although Lord Lytton, the then Viceroy, was commanded to hold a Durbar on that occasion. Even his Oriental imagination shrank from anything so startling, and he followed the procedure which has always been adopted on similar occasions of asking the sanction of Parliament. Now, for the first time, a great change is introduced into the Government of India which, whether for good or bad,
<col>142</col>
is without the hall-mark of Parliamentary approval and has not had behind it the sanction of the representatives of the people.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00369">The case is in one respect rendered worse, because you have utilised the authority of the Sovereign to settle in your own way an issue of the most acutely controversial character. I allude, of course, to the Partition of Bengal, upon which parties both in India and in this country are, and have been, sharply divided. This is, indeed, a very dangerous precedent, for if the King may be brought in to upset the decision of one party he may equally be brought in to reverse the policy of another. There is another and more insidious danger. If the policy which you have placed in the mouth of the Sovereign is a popular and successful policy&#x2014;as we all hope it may be&#x2014;then the credit will attach, in large measure, to the Sovereign. But supposing your policy is not so fortunate in its results. Then some portion of the blame can hardly fail to fall upon the innocent shoulders of the Sovereign himself.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00370">These are the main reasons why we regard your conduct as unconstitutional. If any lawyer here were to ask me what I mean by the word "unconstitutional" in this case my reply might not be a legal one, but I think it would meet the circumstances of the case. By unconstitutional I mean contrary to the settled practice and the established usage of our Constitution. You have done in India what no British Government has ever done there before. You have done what you would not have dared to attempt in England, what if we had attempted to do either here or in India you would have made the heavens ring with your denunciations, and you have done it in a manner that saves you from retribution and screens you from attack. The Secretary of State may say in reply to me that he could not have done it in any other way. I should feel tempted to rejoin that if that were so it ought not to be done at all. If your proposals were so controversial that you could not rely upon the favourable judgment of the public then you ought not to have resorted to this device to carry them through. On the other hand, if your proposals were as reasonable and popular as I believe you claim them to be, then there ought to have been no hesitation in submitting them to public opinion in advance.</p>
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0097"/>
<col>143</col>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00371">There is one defence which I hope the Secretary of State for India will not make. It is contained in an astonishing sentence in the speech of the Prime Minister the other evening in the House of Commons. The right hon. gentleman argued that the two policies of the Partition of Bengal in my time and the transfer of the capital of India and the reversal of Partition now are on all fours, because in the one case the policy was announced by the King and in the other case by Lord Curzon. Surely this is the flimsiest and most transparent of fallacies&#x0021;In the one case, when the decision was announced in my time, it had been discussed in every Government and every newspaper in India, and after a Blue Book full of information had been for months in the possession of Parliament and public at home, whereas your policy was announced without consultation with anybody and without the publication of any Papers at all. In the second place, my policy could be reversed, as you have reversed it. Your policy cannot. I hope, therefore, that whatever defence you offer it may be something better than and different from this trumpery and shallow excuse which did service in the House of Commons.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00372">There is one other feature of your policy to which I think it is my duty to call attention in passing, and that is the extreme secrecy and the almost indecent haste of your procedure. The Government of India has many virtues and I have no doubt some failings, but I have always thought its most admirable feature to be the extreme deliberation with which it prepares its cases and the frankness with which it takes the public into its counsels. No Government&#x2014;certainly no Government that is often called despotic&#x2014;lives so much in an atmosphere of public criticism as the Government of India. Before any new policy can be adopted there it is examined by the local Governments, referred to and after wards reported upon by local representative bodies and discussed in the Press. Only after it has gone through this ordeal is it sent home to the Secretary of State. Your policy was not referred to a single local Government; not a single Lieutenant-Governor was consulted. Even the Lieutenant-Governor of the Province most concerned only learnt of it the night before it was announced at Delhi. You cannot quote a single opinion of a representative body in India in favour of your policy&#x2014;I mean
<col>144</col>
given before the policy was announced. Only three years ago in this House was set up, on the initiative of Lord Morley, a great scheme of Legislative Councils in India, Imperial and provincial, and the noble Viscount was most eloquent about the manner in which those bodies would focus the intelligence, the sentiments, the aspirations of the Indian people. They were to constitute a sort of bridge between the Government and the people. Did you consult them? Is not the question of the capital of India of any interest to the representative bodies whom you have set up? Have they not their views about it? You said nothing to them at all on the subject. You may say that your policy was approved by the Viceroy and his Council. I cannot, of course, comment upon the conditions under which the Council of the Viceroy gave its assent in India. But I do know&#x2014;I say it without any invidious intent&#x2014;that that Council represents a shorter experience of India than any Council in modern times. If the Secretary of State goes on to tell me that his policy was approved by his Council at home, I shall be greatly surprised&#x2014;I think I am speaking what is common knowledge&#x2014;if those gentlemen were consulted under conditions that rendered independent examination and criticism, much less refusal, on their part at all possible. But that, my Lords, is the limit of the support which the Secretary of State can claim. I do not know if he congratulates himself on the manner in which it has been carried through, but I can assure him that there are great searchings of heart in many quarters as to the manner in which it has been done, and that those, at any rate, with whom I come in contact who are best acquainted with India think that a dangerous precedent has been set up which they earnestly hope may never again be followed in the future.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00373">I pass from the manner and methods of your policy to its concrete form. I have to deal with that policy in relation to six matters. One, the removal of the capital from Calcutta; two, the reversal of the Partition of Bengal; three, the revival of the Chief Commissionership of Assam; four, the creation of the new Province of Behar; five, the placing of the capital at Delhi; and six, the question of finance. As regards Calcutta, I hope I shall not be tempted to overstate the case of Calcutta. I have a very warm feeling for Calcutta
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0098"/>
<col>145</col>
myself. It has always seemed to me to be a worthy capital and expression of British rule in India. It is English built, English commerce has made it the second city in the Empire, for so it is, in population and size, and from the offices of the Government in Calcutta English statesmen, administrators, and generals have built up to its present commanding height the fabric of British rule in India. Calcutta has had a splendid past, and whatever happens to it in the future nothing can alter that. Now what are the reasons in your Despatch for dethroning Calcutta? They are of very varying value. In the first place, the Government of India argue that geographically Calcutta is ill-adapted to be the capital because it is in a corner of India. I will not lay too much stress upon that. Capitals are seldom chosen for their central position. Neither St. Petersburg, Paris, nor Washington are in the centre of their respective countries, and I do not think that London is in the centre of the British Isles. Railway facilities are so great nowadays that geographical difficulties are overcome.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00374">There is another extraordinary argument in the Despatch which I fail to understand, and that is the argument that the Imperial Legislative Council can do its work better in a more central position. You might just as well argue that the American Congress cannot do its duty well because the capital of Washington is in an eastern State. The second reason given in the Despatch is one upon which the Secretary of State has laid some stress, but which, if I may say so, seems to me to be very feeble. The Government of India say that it is a serious anomaly that the two Governments, Imperial and local, should exist side by side in the same city, and the Secretary of State goes on to advance the extraordinary proposition that the Governor-General in India thereby becomes saddled with the responsibility of the Bengal Government and that the local Government suffers from the loss of a sense of responsibility. I do not recognise that picture. I spent seven winters in Calcutta, a longer time than any ex-Viceroy living, and I was brought in contact with three Lieutenant-Governors of Bengal. No trouble occurred between the two Governments in my day. Most friendly relations prevailed between the individuals and the Governments. I constantly received assistance from them, and
<col>146</col>
I believe the Government of Bengal welcomed the appearance of the Government of India with its highly-trained body of expert officials, because it widened their outlook and taught them other things, and certainly for my part I welcomed contact and association with the officials of the Government of Bengal. I challenge the noble Marquess to produce the evidence of a single Lieutenant-Governor, past or present, who will dispute what I have said on this subject. Then a bigger anomaly has been left untouched. For seven months of the year the Imperial Government and a Local Government exist side by side on the narrow ridge of Simla, a much more anomalous and difficult position than their juxtaposition for the remainder of the year in Calcutta. Every argument that the noble Marouess has used with regard to Calcutta applies with double force to Simla. I invite him to say, as he has turned the Government of India out of Calcutta, whether he is going to turn it out of Simla too.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00375">The third reason given in the Despatch is, I venture to say, the real one, though it is wrapped up in somewhat euphemistic language. The Government of India say that they desire to withdraw the Government of India from its present provincial environment and from the influence of local opinion. I am indeed amused at a Liberal Government desiring to withdraw its representatives from contact with local opinion. How often have we been advised in this House that this is the ideal we ought to have in view, and how often did the noble Viscount (Lord Morley) reproach me in the old days with having carried my partition of Bengal without sufficient reference to local opinion? Well, I have no doubt that this represents the real feeling and desire of the Government of India. They desire to escape the somewhat heated atmosphere of Bengal and to say good-bye to the Bengali friends for whom they have just done so much. I have some sympathy with that feeling, but do not let us be hypocritical about it. If that is the reason why you are leaving Calcutta, do not attempt to assign other reasons which are of greatly inferior importance.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00376">As to the future of Calcutta, I am not one of those who think that the removal of the Government will seriously or detrimentally affect it. The importance of Calcutta
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0099"/>
<col>147</col>
results from its position on the sea, from its proximity to the great sources of supply of jute and coal and tea in Eastern India, and from the enterprise of its merchants. I dare say there will be some displacement of trade, some depreciation of property, perhaps some loss of money to individual firms; but I have little doubt that the mercantile community in Calcutta will show the patriotism and public spirit which they have displayed all along, and that, sore as they are at the displacement of their metropolitan city, they will bend their backs to win for Calcutta in the future as great and famous a place as it has had in the past. Personally I think the removal of the Government from Calcutta much more injurious to the Government than it will be to Calcutta. Of course this displacement will be welcomed elsewhere in India. I have never been able to understand why it is that rival cities regard each other with a jealousy to which rival lovers and even rival politicians seldom attain. But so it is. Glasgow and Edinburgh, Manchester and Liverpool, Milan and Turin, Petersburg and Moscow&#x2014;in none of these cases is there any great warmth of affection between the two cities or their inhabitants. And it is quite true that the supremacy of Calcutta has always excited very poignant emotions in the breasts of Madras and Bombay. Every year there is a sort of struggle when the Census figures come out to try and prove that Calcutta is or is not the premier city in India, and, though I do not wish to do my friends who have been Governors of Madras an injustice, I believe that at the bottom of their hearts there is a sort of sneaking satisfaction at the dethronement of Calcutta.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00377">But you have not merely dethroned Calcutta; you have accompanied that act with the reversal of the so-called partition of Bengal. It is six and a-half years since that measure was carried. I use the phrase "partition" for brevity sake; I do not think it at all describes the fact. During that time I have seen the most extraordinary descriptions of the object of the Government of India which have made me sometimes rub my eyes and wonder whether I was living in a world of reality. Every one knows that that was an administrative measure which had been called for for years. I was not the man to start it. It had been discussed for twenty years before my day. I took it up because half way through my time in India I became
<col>148</col>
acquainted with the scandalous maladministration which was going on in the Eastern Province of Bengal, and the shocking neglect of education and public works and all that goes to make the contented life of a people, and with the oppression of the Mahomedans by their neighbours. That was a blot upon the Government of India. It was due to the fact that you were trying to administer the affairs of eighty millions of people through one Government and one man, and the only way to remedy it was to divide the Province and duplicate the machinery of government. What was the particular line to be drawn when the division was made was a matter not for the Viceroy. The Viceroy does not settle such issues. The line was settled by consultation and discussion between the local Governments and officials, representative bodies, and so on. They agreed upon a line, and that line was based upon ethnical and geographical considerations, the importance of which could not be denied. I gladly accepted it. I knew the obloquy with which I should be overwhelmed, because I was aware that the line of division would run counter to the personal interests of journalists, pleaders, and landlords whose headquarters were Calcutta. But I was willing to run the risk. I decided to bear the brunt because I believed the decision to be right, and because I was certain that in the long run&#x2014;I hoped in the short run&#x2014;truth would prevail.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00378">The Partition was promulgated in October, 1905. I came home the month after, and the Liberal Government came into office in December. They might have disowned my act, the act of my Government, and I should not have complained if they had done so. I might have regretted it, but I could not have complained. But no, they accepted it. The noble Viscount will bear me out that never on a single occasion, public or private, did I ever put any pressure upon him. I do not think I ever mentioned it to him. They decided on their own initiative to carry on that policy. The noble Viscount said he disapproved of the methods by which it had been carried. I never knew what he meant by that. But he said over and over again in this House and elsewhere that he and his colleagues regarded it as a settled fact. That reply was repeated over and over again by your officials in India. Now what happened? As time went on the Bengalis began to realise that their agitation was
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0100"/>
<col>149</col>
futile. The fruits of partition became manifest. The new Province advanced in education, in good government, in every mark of prosperity. Your officers there did the most admirable work in creating this new fabric, and over and over again, acting on your instructions, they repeated the assurance to the population that this was a settled fact and that the good faith of the British Government was pledged to its continuance. It is true that outside a fitful and sputtering agitation was kept up by the Bengali community, but that was done more for form than for anything else, and there was neither substance nor life in the agitation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00379">Your Lordships may think I am an interested party. Let me therefore give you the opinions, not of myself, but of important natives of India. There is a well-known Bengali writer, Mr. Mitra, who wrote in 1908 a book called "Indian Problems," and this is what he said&#x2014;
<quote>"The cut-and-dried phrases of the professional agitator should not confuse the British public. It is clear that the partition does not make the Bengali a farthing the worse in person, reputation, or pocket. It was an admirable move, calculated to benefit millions."</quote>
Then there was a discussion in the Imperial Legislative Council. My noble friend Lord Minto was in the Chair and will recall what I am going to say. One of the most conspicuous Congress representatives had repeated the familiar charges against the Partition, and a native member for the Province got up and said (this was on March 30, 1910)&#x2014;
<quote>"On the strength of the views of Lord MacDonnell the Partition of Bengal has been called a blunder, and your Excellency has been invited to undo it. I, on the other hand, knowing and realising full well the responsibility that attaches to a member of this Council, most emphatically assert that if the Government meddled with this beneficent measure it would be committing an act of supreme folly; it would be creating serious discontent and unrest where none exist now."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00380"><member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD</member><membercontribution>: Will the noble Earl mention the speaker's name?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00381"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: Yes. He was Mr. Magharul Hague, Mahomedan member for Eastern Bengal; and this gentleman was followed by Mr. Shamsul Huda, another native member, who said he had once signed a petition against
<col>150</col>
Partition but had grown wiser as years rolled by, and he described the Partition as greatly beneficial to the Province. I should like to quote one other authority, that of the distinguished Correspondent of <i>The Times</i>. I quote this authority because <i>The Times</i> is, as I gather, one of the leading supporters of His Majesty's Government in this case, and it is interesting therefore to know what their Correspondent said when he was in India three years ago. He wrote&#x2014;
<quote>"The agitation against Partition is dying, even in Bengal, and is almost unregarded in the other Provinces. The authorities are too firmly convinced of the administrative value of the division to attempt any modification now, and there is the further fact that any reversal of policy might have dangerous results. The eighteen millions of Mahomedans would bitterly resent any suggestion of the repeal of Partition. It stands in no need of renewed vindication, for it has been entirely justified by results."</quote>
The second passage is even stronger&#x2014;this was written in Bengal on February 15, 1909&#x2014;
<quote>"I have yet to meet anybody, English or Indian, who can tell me in what respect the Partition has injured a single living soul, while one has only to visit the Province, invigorated with new life and inspired by new aspirations, to realise the benefits which the severance has conferred upon millions of neglected people. To alter or to modify it now would be suicidal folly. It would be worse, for it would be a criminal blunder."</quote>
That is very strong language&#x2014;it is not mine, it comes from an authority much greater than myself&#x2014;and I leave His Majesty's Government to dispose of it as best they can. This is the moment, when this spurious and vexatious agitation has died down, when the benefits of Partition have been conclusively vindicated, when everything is going well in the new Province, that a new Viceroy appears on the scene and in a few weeks is enabled to inform the world that all of us have been entirely wrong.<lb/>
The Government of India say in their Despatch that the bitterness of feeling engendered by the Partition of Bengal is very widespread, that the resentment among the Bengalis is as strong as ever though less vocal, and the Government of India make the astonishing discovery that the Partition has been responsible for the growing estrangement in many parts of the country between Mahomedans and Hindus. Finally, in comes the Secretary of State, also new to his Office, and he tells
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0101"/>
<col>151</col>
us that the Viceroy has depicted the consequences of Partition with accuracy and fairness. I deny every one of those propositions and I challenge the noble Marquess to produce any competent or reliable evidence in support of the assertions which he contends are characterised by accuracy and fairness. Can he quote the authority of a single Lieutenant-Governor who has served in Bengal in recent years? Can he quote the authority of the last or the present Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal? Can he name a single representative body or institution in India that will support his view? I have heard of none, and I am not aware that they exist. I think I can quote the highest authority of all, and that is the Secretary of State himself. If you look at the White Paper you will see that on November 1 the Secretary of State put his signature to the Despatch in which he congratulates the Government of India on the accuracy and fairness of their statement&#x2014;this statement about the ill-feeling and unrest existing in Bengal about Partition. But on November 2 we had a debate in this House about some Indian matters, and the Secretary of State then used a different line of argument. He wanted to show how well things were going on, and he said&#x2014;
<quote>"There is nothing now in the general temper, not merely of the people of India as a whole, but of any race or section of the people of India, which ought to cause anything which can be described by the word 'anxiety.'"</quote>
When the Secretary of State made that remark, which I believed to be true, I loudly cheered, and I should have cheered all the more had I known that he was cutting away the ground from his own statement of the day before, and that he was about so effectually to demolish his own case.<lb/>
I dare say the Secretary of State will try to console me by saying that partition has not been revoked&#x2014;that my Government divided Bengal into two Provinces, and that he has divided Bengal into three, and that therefore he is carrying further the principle which I adopted. In fact that is true. There is no reversion to the <i>status quo ante</i>. Nobody would be foolish or insane enough to propose such a thing. But to all intents and purposes the old partition has been reversed. For the Province I have described has ceased to exist, and the Mahomedans in it, who were
<col>152</col>
for the first time given a chance of asserting their independent existence, are once again merged in a great Hindu province, the fortunes of which will be dictated from Calcutta. Perhaps the best judges of whether partition is reversed or not will be found in India herself. Directly after the announcement was made at Delhi the Congress Committee met and passed a vote of thanks to the Government for the fulfilment of their political aspirations; and subsequently, at the meeting of the Congress, the President spoke of the annulment of partition as a triumph in the most momentous Constitutional struggle in modern times. Not in any part of India is there any doubt that agitation has won the day. You may disclaim that that was your intention, but so it is universally regarded, and if so no one is really responsible but yourselves. If you declare a measure to be a settled fact and instruct your officials so to inform the people, and if then, six years later, you turn round and throw to the winds what you have said, can you be surprised that this is regarded on your part as an exhibition of weakness or that it is thought and said that agitation has won the day?<lb/>
Now as regard the Mahomedans, what do they say? Do they agree that partition has not been reversed? My Lords, I think the position of the Mahomedans in Eastern Bengal is one of the saddest features of the present situation. For six years or more they have held aloof from agitation and have occupied themselves with building up their Province. Dacca, the capital, had started upon a new life; they looked forward to having a University and High Court there; over and over again they have been to the Government and have been assured by the officers of Government that the thing was a settled fact and was going to remain. Now that policy is reversed. No wonder they feel bitter&#x0021;I speak from having seen letters from their leading men and from a knowledge of resolutions which have been passed in all their cities. It is a matter of common knowledge throughout India that their leading nobleman, when he was decorated the other day at Delhi, said&#x2014;
<quote>"The ribbon which you hang round my neck is a halter with which I am to hang myself."</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00382"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: May I ask the noble Earl's authority for that singular statement?</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0102"/>
<col>153</col>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00383"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: I can give the noble Marquess the authority privately. It has been constantly repeated and is well known to be the fact. All these resolutions speak of the Government having gone back on its word, and the face of Government as being blackened. If I were the Secretary of State handing an olive branch to India I confess that I should feel some pang of compunction at this sacrifice of Mahomedan interests. It is a bad thing for the Government of India when its word is broken. It is a bad thing for the prestige of Government. It is a bad thing for your officers, too. I wonder have you paused to think what are the sentiments of your officials in this Province who for years past have been assuring the people that you would be true to your word, and who now see&#x2014;I will not say their work thrown away, because good work is never thrown away, but see the pledges which they have given with your authority broken.<lb/>
The Government of India are, I know, conscious of this feeling, and they have sought in their Despatch to allay the fears of the Mahomedans. In their Despatch the Government of India say that the numbers of the Mahomedans will be about equal to those of the Bengalis in the new Province, and they will have special representation in the Council. I do not think there is much comfort to be derived from that. The Mahomedans in India know very well that they cannot compete with the Bengalis in organisation, in education, or in wealth. Influence in India is not a question of numbers; it is a question of ability and character and organisation. Nothing, I am afraid, can alter the fact that whereas up to December 12 last the Mahomedans of Eastern Bengal were the predominant element in the Province now the balance has swung round and once more they are under Calcutta.<lb/>
The Government of India in their Despatch say that the new Governor of Bengal is to reside at Dacca from time to time, and the Secretary of State goes rather further and says that the Governor should regard Dacca as a second capital with a claim on his attention and residence for an appreciable part of the year. What does that mean? Is residence at Dacca to be optional? What in practice will happen? I know very well that in the winter mouths Calcutta will pull him in
<col>154</col>
one direction, that in the summer months Darjeeling will pull him in another, and that Dacca stands the risk of being squeezed out between these two. I do not think the assurances in the Despatch are enough. There is a strong feeling in India that it would be well to place some statutory obligation upon the Governor of Bengal to spend a certain part of the year at Dacca. I do not give an opinion on that point, but I do say we ought to instruct him to spend at least three months of the year in Dacca, and if possible to take with him the Council and the whole machinery of Government. This is the only way in which you can derive any return for the enormous sums spent on establishing a capital at Dacca&#x2014;between&#x00A3;500,000 and&#x00A3;1,000,000&#x2014;and in which you can salve the wounded feelings of Mahomedans and give them some guarantee of fair treatment in future.<lb/>
Before I pass away from Bengal there are two features of your policy there to which I can only allude in passing. The first is this. You are setting up government by a Governor in Council in Bengal. That is an old and much-debated question. It has been agitated for fifty years. The weight of authority has always been against the suggestion. Personally I am against government by a Governor in Council for Bengal. I do not think the situation in Bengal is likely best to be dealt with by a Governor from home, necessarily ignorant of India and likely to be in many cases a Party politician. I have always held that Bengal with its peculiar and complex problems demanded the very best man the Service of India can produce. I wonder if there is a single Lieutenant-Governor or ex-Lieutenant-Governor who shares your feelings. I rather think Lord MacDonnell, who acted for a short time as Governor, does.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00385"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: I have been brought in contact with four or five Lieutenant-Governors, and I have not found one who did not hold the views which I have just expressed. The second feature to which I must allude in passing is this, that the first price you have to pay for your reconstituted Bengal is the discontent of the Service. Your new Bengal will not possess a single healthy district,
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0103"/>
<col>155</col>
and it is not surprising, therefore, that the Civil Service should have unanimously petitioned to be transferred elsewhere. This is not a selfish or negligible attitude on their part. You cannot expect men to go on toiling in that climate from year's end to year's end without sometimes having a change from an unhealthy to a healthy district. You want your Service in Bengal to be the most efficient that India can provide, but if everyone shirks Bengal the Province will obtain not the best but the worst, and if your Civil Servants there become weakened in physical stamina or in spirit it must react on the administration. If you look at the scheme in the manner in which it affects Bengal, there is not much cause for satisfaction. You have yielded to a dying and, as I think, factitious agitation; you have bitterly offended the Mahomedans and taught them that the word of the British Raj can be broken; you have set up a Province which will be the most unpopular in India, and you have instituted a form of government which, in my judgment, is unsuitable for the Province and the people. So much for Bengal.<lb/>
I must, at the risk of wearying your Lordships, say a word about two other ancillary arrangements which you contemplate in that part of India. The first of these is with regard to Assam. It is part of your plan that Assam should revert to government by a Chief Commissioner, and the reasons given in the Despatch for so doing are, first, that it is a frontier province which ought to be under the direct control of the Government of India; secondly, that it is a backward province; and, thirdly, that no one is very likely to object. I venture to say that these are very weak reasons. They are afterthoughts intended to justify a decision arrived at on other grounds. There is no analogy whatever between the North-East and North-West Frontiers of India. On the North-East frontier adjoining Assam you have to deal with hill tribes armed with bows and arrows; on the North-West you are confronted with the formidable Pathan organisation, and behind is the kingdom of Afghanistan. You say that Assam is a backward province. So it has been, and you now propose to stereotype it in its backwardness. It was precisely because it was backward that we took it up and made it part of a larger province in order to bring it into line with the best traditions of Indian rule. Another defect that you
<col>156</col>
will reproduce by reverting to the old arrangement is that being a small province Assam had no Service or Commission of its own. It had to borrow its officers from Bengal, and to take, of course, what Bengal chose to give it, and, Assam being backward and unpopular, Bengal did not give the best, and at the end of five years when those officers had a right to revert the best of them went back. The consequence was that at each stage Assam got the worst of the bargain and the administration suffered all round. When we brought Assam into the heart of a bigger province these conditions were removed, and Assam got its chance. All these advantages are sacrificed by the proposal, and in their Despatch the Government of India do not seem even to be aware of their existence. Assam is treated as a petty pawn on the board which could be moved about without any regard to what it wanted or desired.<lb/>
A word about the new province of Behar, Chota Nagpur, and Orissa. This Province is made up of the non-Bengali leavings on the west of your new Bengal, and it is justified in your Despatch on these grounds. The Government of India say that the Beharis do not like the Bengalis and would welcome separation. Very likely that is true. They say it is in accordance with popular sentiment in Orissa, which certainly it is not, and will be welcomed in Behar as giving Behar a seaboard. Of course, that is absolute nonsense. Calcutta is and always must remain the seaport of Behar, to which it is linked by two railways. What is the good of holding out the attraction to Behar of the possession of a sea coast with which there is no railway connection whatever and where there is no seaport? You might just as well tell colliery proprietors in Staffordshire that you propose to deprive them of their facilities for despatching coal to London, but that you will open up to them the ports of the Norfolk coast. This Province of yours has been drawn up without the slightest regard to the interests or views of the inhabitants and you violate there every principle you have adopted in respect to Bengal.<lb/>
Take the Orissans. No one has paused to think what they want. You could not know because of your secrecy and because you consulted nobody in advance. They want the reunion of the Uriya-speaking people. They want to remain under
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0104"/>
<col>157</col>
Calcutta, to which they have been attached so long. What is the good of Orissa being tied to the tail of Behar, where there is no affinity of language or race, with which they have nothing in common, and from which they are separated by a great belt of mountains and rivers over which we have never been able to carry a railway. I venture to prophesy that this is a blunder that cannot remain permanent. If the Orissans were an agitating people, which they are not, they would soon make their protest heard. As it is, they have been sacrificed without compunction. The same might be said of Chota Nagpur, but I will not labour that point. The fact is, this new province of yours on the west of Bengal is a bundle of odds and ends which you have thrown together because you did not know what else to do with them. In Bengal you have united Bengalis, because they are all of the same race and language, but when you come to these other provinces you force into an unnatural union three peoples of different race and language. I shall pursue this aspect of the case no further, but I can truthfully say that none of my criticisms, though they may appear strong, are captious. They all rest upon information and, if I may say so, upon personal knowledge, and they are put forward, not in the least with the view of embarrassing His Majesty's Government, but of showing the results of their secrecy and of calling their attention to errors that must be put right before the settlement is made final.<lb/>
My Lords, I pass to Delhi. Perhaps it may be said that all these anomalies, if they exist, are compensated by the transfer of the capital to Delhi, and we may be asked, "Is not this a great Imperial scheme?" I suppose all of us who have served in India have thought a great deal about Delhi. I had to decide whether to hold the Durbar at Delhi, and I decided unhesitatingly in the affirmative. I had to decide whether the site of the Victoria Memorial Hall should be at Delhi, and I decided in the negative. I had not considered the question of the capital at Delhi, although it was often in my mind. There are eloquent passages in these Despatches about the historical associations of Delhi, and the Secretary of State, in particular, has rather given the rein to his poetical imagination in talking about the old-time drama of Hindu history and of satisfying the historical sense of millions. I do not
<col>158</col>
deny the glamour of the name of Delhi or the stories that cling about its dead and forgotten cities. But I venture to say this, that if we want to draw happy omens for the future the less we say about the history of Delhi the better. Modern Delhi is only 250 years old. It was only the capital of the Moguls in the expiring years of their <i>r&#x00E9;gime</i>, and it was only the capital of their effective rule for little more than 100 years. Of course, there were capitals there before it, but all have perished, one after another. We know that the whole environment of Delhi is a mass of deserted ruins and graves, and they present to the visitor, I think, the most sorrowful picture you can conceive of the mutability of human fortunes. You may say that the fate of India has been decided three times outside Delhi. So it has, and on each occasion it is the defenders who have been defeated. I venture to say that the less we talk about the history of Delhi the better, and that His Majesty's Government will be on much surer ground if instead of saying anything about the dead capitals of the past, they try to create a living capital in the future.<lb/>
What is the case that they have made for the choice of Delhi as a capital? The points they name are that its situation is central, that it is the meeting place of many railways, that it is reasonably near to Simla, and that, therefore, there will be a saving in the cost of the annual migration, and that it is in close proximity to some, at any rate, of the great Princes of India. I desire to allow full value to these considerations for what they may be worth, although none of them appear to be vital. While, for instance, Delhi is more central to Bombay, it is much less central to Burma, to Madras, that great city, or to Mysore or Haidarabad, the Principalities of great Princes. Again, if it is so close to Simla why is it necessary to have two capitals with all their offices and paraphernalia within twelve hours of each other? When you refer to the loyalty of the Princes, which is one of the most splendid assets of India, I am not sure that it is at all desirable that they should be brought up from their States into constant residence in the capital of the Government. These may be on the whole minor points.<lb/>
The points which I want to put before the Secretary of State are these, and I think they are major points. First, as to
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0105"/>
<col>159</col>
the healthiness of Delhi; second, as to its strategical position; third, as to the accessibility of the Government and the capital to public opinion. Above all I desire to ask what is the effect that the institution of your capital at Delhi will have on India and on British rule in India in the times that lie before us. These are real factors which no historical associations, no amount of sentimental glamour ought to be allowed to override. As to the healthiness of Delhi, the Despatch of the Government of India says that it possesses a good climate for seven months of the year and that the Government will live there from October 1 to May 1. Are you quite sure of that? I have been at Delhi in October and in April several times, and I know those are months of the year in which there is a good deal of fever and malaria, particularly after the rains. In former days the water supply of Delhi was very bad, but now it is obtained by filtered water from the river. Have you satisfied yourselves that you can from that or from other sources derive a water supply for a great capital city?<lb/>
Take the question of site. The Government of India were in such haste that we are told in the papers that they settled on the site of the Durbar camps and they even invited His Majesty to lay the foundation-stone. May 1 tell your Lordships a little story? When I was in India I too held a Durbar on the same site and, when that Durbar was over, feeling that in some way or other the site which had witnessed the Proclamation of Queen Victoria's Imperial Title and also the Proclamation of the Coronation of the late King Edward the Seventh ought to be commemorated, I set about endeavouring to convert the arena and its surroundings into a beautiful and orderly garden so as to create a memorial that should be worthy of those great events. Lord pinto will bear in mind what I am going to refer to. These attempts went on for two years, and at the end of that time it was found that the soil was so impregnated with alkalis that nothing would grow. After the rains the whole expanse was inundated and was converted into a great marsh, the waters of which, when they receded, killed everything in the soil. There is only one village on the site, and that village is surrounded by high walls of mud in order to keep out the inundations which prevail for months every year. I have been informed that
<col>160</col>
the Government of India have already abandoned the first site they selected and are looking somewhere else. I do not want to put any difficulties in the way of getting a site&#x2014;how could I? I only want the Secretary of State to recognise that the question of site is of great importance, and it would, indeed, be a calamitous thing if you planted down your capital in a place where, in the future, you found Englishmen could not live.<lb/>
I take the second point, a point with which it is rather difficult to deal but on which I must say a word&#x2014;that is the security of the position of Delhi. 1 dare say noble Lords are familiar with the famous pronouncement of the Duke of Wellington. It is contained in Lord Stan-hope's "Notes of Conversations with the Duke of Wellington at Walmer Castle" in 1844&#x2014;
<quote>"I talked to the Duke on India. He has, I find, strong opinions against the idea of transferring the seat of Government from Calcutta to one of the cities higher up the country, as Agra. It is indispensable, he thinks, to the maintenance of our Indian Empire that our Indian capital should be in some situation where our naval superiority may, if necessary, be brought into play."</quote>
I am far from saying that the strategical position in India is the same now as in the days of the Duke of Wellington. India has been absolutely transformed since then. The strength of British power is immeasurably greater than it was; railway communication has spread everywhere throughout the country; firearms alone are entirely different from what they were in those days. But the physical facts of India are unalterable; they remain exactly the same. Look at it in this way. If the Government of India had been in Delhi at the time of the Mutiny would you have been satisfied with your position? I know many good authorities in India, not at all unprepared to accept the change of capital to Delhi, who are by no means convinced of the desirability of placing the seat of Government and the residence of the Viceroy in so advanced a position. And I know, further, that what I am saying at this Table is the view of the most expert military opinion and military authorities in India. I am not competent to offer an opinion on the matter myself. The matter lies outside my purview. I will only say this, that while I shall welcome any indication from the noble Marquess that the matter has been carefully considered by those who are qualified to advise, the
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0106"/>
<col>161</col>
situation, so far as I understand it, is one that must cause him some degree of anxiety.<lb/>
But, my Lords, suppose all these doubts to be resolved, suppose you to get your site and drain it and to obtain your water supply, and to be perfectly satisfied as to the strategical security of your position (and I hope all this may be the case), when you have built your new capital, will it be a source of influence and of strength to your Government? Will it enable them better to understand the heart of India, and to grasp its problems? That is the real issue we have to have in mind. What is the great danger that attends the Government of India? It is this, and it is responsible for the agitation which has gone on for years against the movement to the hills. It is the danger that the Government of India may become aloof from public opinion, that it may be shut off from the main currents of public life, that it may become immersed in a sort of bureaucratic self-satisfaction. There was no fear of that when we went down to Calcutta. At Calcutta we were in the surge and movement of life. There was a mixed society there. You heard opinions of every variety awl form&#x2014;opinions of merchants, hankers, traders, business men of every sort. There was the society of Judges and lawyers, both European and. native. There were the officials of the local Governments, there was a regular stream of travellers and visitors coming into Calcutta from all parts of the world. It was life, and when, after my long residence at Simla, I went, at the close of my tours in the country, to Calcutta, I felt once again life and movement throbbing around me. I say distinctly that our time at Calcutta was of enormous value to the Government. It brightened our minds, it widened our outlook, it brought us into the main stream of national existence.<lb/>
There is serious danger that, when you have built your capital at Delhi, the Government will become more isolated, more bureaucratic, less in touch with public opinion than it is now. You are going to create a territorial enclave; you are also going to run the risk that your Government will become a political enclave. Delhi cannot be a great commercial city&#x2014;it can only be a manufacturing city or a distributing centre on a small scale&#x2014;for the trade of India must rest on the sea. There can be no trading community
<col>162</col>
at Delhi on a large scale. There is to be no High Court there. There will be the people who will come up to do business with the Government from time to time; there will be nobody else. Your new city is to be placed outside the walls of a quite small native town of 200,000 people, and there the Government will live shut off, as I think, from the rest of India. If that be at all a correct anticipation, and I hope it may not be, do believe me that the isolation of your Government will have this effect. In the first place, it will diminish its prestige; in the second place, it will react upon the efficiency of administration; and, in the third place, it will shorten your rule in India. So strongly do you feel on that point that in one Despatch the Government of India or the Secretary of State speaks of the removal to Delhi as a proof of the unalterable determination to maintain British rule in India. Why it should be necessary to give any demonstration of that principle now I do not know. 1 should have thought it was the basic principle of British rule, and how the shifting of the capital from the English city with which it has been associated for 150 years to the dead capital of Mahomedan Kings can indicate a fixed determination to maintain your rule in India I cannot tell. And if you re-assert your determination to do so at the same time that you weaken the supports on which that determination rests you will not be better off, but worse off.<lb/>
There only remains the question of finance, and this is in a sense the most important of all. What will this cost? The Government of India say&#x2014;
<quote>"The cost of the transfer will be considerable, but we cannot conceive that a larger sum than&#x00A3;4,000,000 will be necessary, including the three years' interest on capital, while the works and buildings are being completed."</quote>
And against this they say must be set the rise in the value of Government land in Delhi, the sale of Government lands and buildings at Calcutta, and the utilisation of the Durbar works at Delhi. I ask, Is it conceivable that these works can be completed in three years? I tell you they will not be done in ten years. At Dacca, where we had to create a provincial capital, it is six years since we began the Government buildings and offices, and they are not complete yet. You are going to build, not a provincial capital, but a great capital
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0107"/>
<col>163</col>
for all India, in three years&#x0021;The idea is ridiculous. Is it conceivable that your expenditure can be confined within &#x00A3;4,000,000? Just look at the items that have to be considered. In the first place there is the cost of the purchase of land. You will take that compulsorily and, therefore, no doubt, you will only pay the market value. Then there is the cost of the buildings you are going to place upon it&#x2014;the new Government House, the new Council Chamber, the new Secretariat, new offices for every Department, or, at any rate, for a majority of the Departments of one of the most complex and elaborate systems of government in the world. It is not merely the cost of the land, but the cost of reclaiming and draining it, and of providing a water supply. Then there is the cost of the extra garrison which you must have to protect your Viceroy when von set him and the Government of India in the plains of Delhi.<lb/>
I pass to Behar and the new province there. There is the cost of the new capital at Patna, the cost of a new summer station for that province and of the new High Court at Patna, for which there is already agitation. All these are initial charges only, but when they are satisfied there will be very heavy recurring charges. Then, I think, any accountant will tell you that you ought to include in the prime cost the loss on the official structures and buildings which you have set up in such profusion in Calcutta and which will either remain unoccupied or, if parted with, will only be parted with at a loss. Since that estimate was made, I have consulted many authorities much better able to give an opinion than I am, and I have not found a single one who has estimated the total cost of these proceedings at less than&#x00A3;8,000,000. The majority estimate the cost at&#x00A3;10,000,000, while there are others, to whom I myself belong, who think that the cost will not be less than&#x00A3;12,000,000.<lb/>
And what is the moment at which you propose to place this charge on the revenues of India? You are confronted now with the imminent loss of your opium revenue to the extent of some millions per annum. Your Finance Minister in India has, in two successive years in his Budget speech, repeated these words&#x2014;
<quote>"I am sure it is absolutely essential to introduce greater sobriety in our public expenditure if we are to avoid deficits and, consequently, enhanced taxation."</quote>
<col>164</col>
It was only three month ago that we were discussing in this House the proposed abolition by the Government of India of a few administrative offices, saving a few thousands of rupees a year, and advocated by them mainly on the score of economy. Even now, almost immediately, you are going to send out a Commission to India in order to discuss whether you cannot, with a view to greater economy, reduce your Native Army in that country. Money is everywhere wanted in India at this moment for railways, irrigation, education, public works, and social reform in all its branches. This is the moment at which you propose to place on the Indian taxpayer this great burden, because although you raise the money by loan the Indian taxpayer has to pay the interest, and there will be less money available for other and much more necessary objects. I venture to say, my Lords, that, without further information than we have received at present, this seems one of the most rash commitments to which His Majesty's Government has ever yet set its hand. Even if your whole object is realised, it is not clear that it kill be worth the price, and if your Army is to be reduced and your administration stinted in order to provide for this purpose, 1 think it will be very doubtful how far your policy will deserve the name of a boon.<lb/>
I would like the Secretary of State to answer one more question, if I may be allowed to ask it. There is one paragraph in the Despatch which has attracted little attention in this country, but which seems to me to be in a sense the most significant of all. It is Paragraph 3 of the Despatch of the Government of India, in which the Government of India light-heartedly, as if they were uttering a mere commonplace instead of putting forward what is, as I conceive, an entirely new form of Government in India, use these words&#x2014;
<quote>"The only possible solution of the difficulty would be gradually giving the Provinces a larger measure of self-government until at last India would consist of a number of administrations, autonomous in all provincial affairs, with the Government of India above them all and possessing power to interfere in cases of misgovernment, but ordinarily restricting their functions to matters of Imperial concern."</quote>
My Lords, this picture of a federation of self-governing and <i>quasi</i>-independent States in India, with the Governor-General in Council existing at the top, interfering only in cases of mis-government&#x2014;and we know
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0108"/>
<col>165</col>
how difficult that would be&#x2014;and confining itself ordinarily to imperial matters, by which I suppose are meant the frontier and the Army, may be a good or a bad idea. In my view it is a bad one, but nobody can doubt that it represents a scheme or a sketch of the future Government of India wholly different from that which has hitherto prevailed. It is not by divided Governments that the Indian Empire has been built, but by the existence of a strong central authority, controlling and supervising all, which you have persuaded in times past the best of your statesmen and administrators to take up, and which they have taken up to the advantage of India and the credit of your country. But this is entirely different. It is true that as time has gone on there has been a delegation of powers to Local Governments, financial, administrative, legislative&#x2014;an inevitable and proper process of which we have not yet reached the end. But if you are going to contemplate, as this Despatch indicates, a policy of separate States in India, a sort of Home Rule all round&#x2014;Mr. John Bright's idea of an India divided into separate States, with separate Governments, separate armies, and so on&#x2014;if you are going to abandon that uniformity in the main principles of government, in the guiding tenets of your administration, which you have hitherto observed, I venture to say the result can only be to lead through disruption to disaster. That is my fear. My fear about this establishment of the capital at Delhi is that your Central Government, instead of becoming stronger, will become weaker. My view is that you will become dissociated from the life and administration of India, and that gradually, as the Provinces follow the line you have laid down and demand increasing Home Rule, your Viceroy in Delhi will become a sort of puppet as the Moguls were towards the end of their regime, and India will break up into separate fragments, as it did in the expiring days of Aurungzebe and his successors. When trouble comes, as it may come some day in India, it will not be by separate Provinces acting on their own account that India will be saved, but by a strong Central Government exercising supervision and control over all.<lb/>
My Lords, I have no time to develop that position. I have merely mentioned it in passing because I could not treat with absolute silence a pronouncement about the future Government of India which
<col>166</col>
seemed to me so profoundly serious as that which I have just read. I apologise to the Secretary of State for the enormous range of the topics to which I have called his attention, and 1 apologise once again to the House for the intolerable call that I have made upon their patience. I wish I could have accepted this decision of His Majesty's Government in absolute silence and allowed the grave pronouncement at Delhi on that historic occasion to pass by without a word of criticism in this House. It would have been much easier and much more agreeable for me to have done that. But, my Lords, I could not do it, because those of us who have served in India have a sense of duty to that country, which we all of us love so well, and to the cause of British rule in India which we have served. Upon some of the features of the policy of His Majesty's Government I entertain serious doubts. I have ventured to place those doubts before your Lordships' House this afternoon. Those doubts are widely entertained by others much more competent to pronounce upon them than myself. In other cases I have ventured to indicate the precautions that may still be taken, mistakes that may, perhaps, be avoided; and my concluding defence, if one is needed, for detaining your Lordships so long is that this House world be of little use, and those of us inside this House who have served in India would be of little use in discharging our duties, if on an occasion fraught with such tremendous consequences as this we did not fearlessly state what we believe to be the truth.</membercontribution></p>

I am certain that it was altogether unnecessary for him to offer any apology, either to the House or to my humble self, for the length of those observations. We all of us at all times admire the eloquence of the noble Earl, and he has covered the vast field of inquiry over which he has travelled this afternoon with the most perfect lucidity, and 1 am quite certain
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0109"/>
<col>167</col>
without in any way wandering from the direct path. 1 did not expect that any of the five noble Lords, members of this House, who have held the office of Viceroy of India in the past, would be likely to start with any bias in favour of the proposals which His Majesty's Government and the Government of India have put forward. After all, my Lords, it is not in human nature for any man who has done a great work such as that which is carried on by the Viceroys of India and done that work with distinction, to begin by believing that the same work will be as adequately done by another man in entirely different conditions. The noble Earl himself has naturally countless recollections of the great public events, <i>quorum pars magna fuit</i>, when the Government of India was carried on at Calcutta and at Simla., and he possesses many delightful and sonic sacred memories of his home life there. It is inconceivable, therefore, that either he or any other of the noble Lords who have filled the same office could start with a bias in favour of so large a change. But that does not mean&#x2014;and I hope the course of the debate will show it later&#2014;that all these five noble Lords share the whole of the objections which the noble Earl has stated to our policy, both as a whole and in its details; or that some of them may not have found reason, as they have examined more closely into our proposals, to modify the objections which I admit they at first would be naturally likely to take.<lb/>
My Lords, if I have anything to complain of in the speech of the noble Earl, it would be that throughout the whole of it his tone was that of a prosecuting counsel. I do not think he uttered, in the course of the whole of his long speech, one word in favour of any detail of any one of our suggestions. And I could not help observing, as I listened to his speech, continual instances of what I would venture to call the well-disciplined exaggeration of the practised advocate, who knows where to add a little colour at some points and how to deepen shadows at other points, when he was discussing those parts of our policy which he considered laid us particularly open to attack. The earlier part of the noble Earl's speech dealt, not with the general merits or with the details of our plan, but with the mode and time of its announcement. Like some other critics he has described our action in that regard as unconstitutional, using thereby a very
<col>168</col>
hard-worked and sometimes ill-used word which seems to me to be almost degenerating into a term of general vituperation to which no special meaning necessarily need be attached. In this case, however, the noble Earl did towards the end of that part of his speech attach something of a definition to his use of the word, because he said that we had violated the settled practice of the Constitution and had screened ourselves from attack by the course we took. As 1 listened to him I could not help congratulating myself that we had screened ourselves from attack, because I do not know what his method of criticism would have been if we had not taken that particular precaution.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, there are two separate lines on which apparently it is possible to accuse us of unconstitutional action. One is that before framing, and certainly before carrying out, this policy we ought to have obtained the sanction of Parliament; and the other line of attack is to say that even if it be granted that this action of ours is so purely executive that it was not necessary for us to obtain the previous sanction of Parliament, even then, that it was an improper thing that the announcement should be made by His Majesty at the Delhi Durbar. Of course, if the first of these charges could be sustained the second would be also sustained. Because if it had been necessary for us to obtain previous Parliamentary sanction either to the removal of the seat of Government from Calcutta to Delhi, or to the creation of a new Province, in that case it is obvious that the whole topic would have been one of public discussion, and therefore there would have been no possibility of its being announced for the first time at the Durbar.<lb/>
I should like to say, first, as regards the origin of this policy, that there seems to have been some misapprehension in some quarters as to what that origin was. I have seen it described as though it had been imposed upon the Government of India from here by His Majesty's Government, in obedience to certain abstract principles which are conceived to be those of the Liberal Party. That is, of course, altogether untrue. The whole policy&#x2014;I describe it so for convenience, although it is, of course, not in one sense a policy, but a series of Acts of Administration&#x2014;the whole policy was worked out step by step between the Government of India and ourselves here, as a series, as I have already
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0110"/>
<col>169</col>
said, of problems of administration, in some degree interdependent, but distinct and separate in themselves. The noble Earl reminded us that even Lord Beaconsfield, with all the gorgeousness of his Oriental imagination. did not attempt to carry out the assumption of the title of Empress of India by Queen Victoria, without applying to Parliament. That is perfectly true. But then, the change in the Royal style was a matter which affected this country as much as it did India. The noble Earl and I. can both remember the agitation which was caused at that time, as to which I am disposed to agree with him that a great many of the members of the Party to which I belong then took a mistaken line in objecting to the assumption of the Imperial title, because events have proved that it was not merely harmless but was in itself desirable. But I would remind the noble Earl that the backbone of the protests which were then made against the assumption of the Imperial title was the belief that the imagination of Lord Beaconsfield, of which the noble Earl has spoken, would cause that title to be generally used here in substitution for and in replacement of the ancient title of King of England, and it was this fear, far more than anything else, which caused the somewhat heated agitation which at that time was raised against the assumption of the Imperial title for India.<lb/>
Then the noble Earl went on to speak of what is still called the Partition of Bengal, and I am bound to say, speaking of the various circumstances connected with that partition, that the noble Earl used a tone which I did not quite recognise, remembering, as I did, the former debate of June 30, 1908. To-day the noble Earl told us that in bringing about that partition he knew what the opposition and criticism would be, and that he decided to bear the brunt of it. But when we go back to June, 1908, my recollection of that debate is&#x2014;and I think it will be shared by all who recall it&#x2014;that the various noble Lords who were, or might have been, concerned in the carrying out of that partition, including the noble Earl himself, were, if I may use a common expression, almost tumbling over each other in their readiness to deny that what they called the credit of it ought to be claimed by them. But at this moment we are mainly concerned with a comparison of the manner in which that great administrative change was brought
<col>170</col>
about, with the manner in which this repartition of Bengal, which is, I think, perhaps the fairest way to describe it, has been brought about by us. Now the original partition was, and I think fairly, treated by the Government of India and by the then Secretary of State as an administrative act, not only not requiring the sanction of Parliament, but one of which Parliament need not even be previously informed.<lb/>
I observe that on July 4, 1905, the noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, who was then Secretary of State, answered Mr. Herbert Roberts, who put a Question on the subject, in these words&#x2014;
<quote>"The proposals of the Government of India reached me on the 18th of February, and I have communicated the decision of the Secretary of State in Council accepting them."</quote>
But he did not say what the proposals of the Government of India were. It was not at that time known what their terms were. Not only that, but in the same year when the noble Viscount&#x2014;Mr. Brodrick, as he then was&#x2014;made his speech on the Indian Budget, he never alluded to the subject of the Partition of Bengal at all, although that is an occasion on which all matters of importance to India are supposed to be discussed; and if I remember right, the only allusion to the topic that was made by anybody in that debate was made by my noble friend Lord Haldane in the course of a general speech on Indian affairs. Therefore I think that we can claim the action of the then Government here and in India as a precedent for not consulting Parliament previously upon these proposals of ours. We are all of us perfectly well aware that the ultimate control of Parliament over Indian matters cannot be disputed and is not disputed. The ultimate control of Parliament over all Indian affairs rests on the simple fact that Parliament can, at any time, get rid of those, whether they be members of the Indian Administration in India or of the Indian Government at home, who are responsible for the conduct of Indian affairs. But Parliament has never sought or wished to discuss the details of all the administrative acts of the Indian Government beforehand, though it, of course, reserves to itself the right of saying that those who carry out administrative acts, which they are entitled by law to carry out, must be subject to any penalty Parliament may think fit to inflict upon them if those acts are disapproved of.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0111"/>
<col>171</col>
The noble Earl dwelt, I think with even more emphasis, upon the fact that we had not obtained sanction in India for our proposals than he did upon the fact that they were not previously presented to Parliament. And I confess that it seemed to me that, in taking the line he did, the noble Earl was walking on somewhat thin ice, because he spoke almost as though India were a country under a Parliamentary system. He spoke without reserve or explanation of the representative bodies whose approval ought to have been sought beforehand, and he seemed, although I am certain he meant nothing of the kind, to take up a position in that regard which some of those who are called in India very advanced politicians would, I think, hesitate to take up. It is, after all, idle to pretend that there is anything resembling a Parliamentary system in India. The functions of the various Legislative Councils are most carefully defined and are very well known. Do not for a moment let us minimise their importance. They are to advise the various Governments on matters of legislation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00388"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>:Perhaps I might say that when I spoke about representative bodies in India I was not alluding to the Legislative Councils; I was alluding to the Chambers of Commerce and various associations in the country who have always been consulted by the Government before any legislative changes are adopted, and none of whom were referred to, as far as know, in the present case.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00389"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I am very glad to have the noble Earl's explanation, because I am afraid that others might have fallen into the same error as I did. He was using the term "representative" in its purely descriptive sense, whereas I was under the impression that he was speaking of the various processes of election through which members of the different representative councils have to pass. I shall deal a little later on with the point which, as I now understand, the noble Earl intended to raise. But, of course, the charge may still be levelled against us that, though we did not go to Parliament or bring the lines of our policy before official bodies in India, we ought to have thrown it on the table of the world at large for public discussion. To return for one moment to the earlier
<col>172</col>
Partition of Bengal, it is quite true that that was to some extent discussed. If I remember aright, in the spring of 1904 the noble Earl himself attended some meetings in Eastern Bengal&#x2014;that is to say, in that part of the proposed Province to which the change was likely to be particularly acceptable, in which he foreshadowed a wider scheme and a possible creation of a Lieutenant-Governorship.<lb/>
I would ask the House to consider for a moment what would have been the result if we had adopted the course of throwing our scheme on the table for discussions in the Press. We could foresee, and 1 do not think we should have been wrong in a single instance, exactly who would be the particular parties who would take exception to particular parts of our scheme, the reasons for which they would make those objections, and the manner in which they would make them. It is, as we hold, one of the merits of the scheme that it does not represent the triumph of any one particular party or creed among the different parties and creeds involved, and there are therefore some features of it which almost every party or section, if they could get the rest of the scheme, would wish to see away. For instance, I have no doubt that many of the inhabitants of Bengal would have thought the scheme an infinitely better one if the Presidency of Bengal had been constituted just as we constituted it, but if at the same time Calcutta had been left as the capital. I have no doubt they would have preferred such a solution. On the other hand, the Mahomedan population of Eastern Bengal, speaking generally, would have preferred to maintain the great numerical preponderance which they were given under the noble Earl's scheme in Eastern Bengal. If they could have kept that, other things being equal, they would have welcomed on several different grounds the transference of the capital from Calcutta to Delhi.<lb/>
Suppose, therefore, for the sake of argument, that we had made this question a subject of public controversy and discussion, announcing that it was an administrative act that we intended to carry out, that it was our definite policy, but that we should be glad to hear what various people had to say upon it. There would undoubtedly have been a marked and lively agitation in Calcutta among the English residents there,
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0112"/>
<col>173</col>
whose case has been so forcibly put by the noble Earl. I daresay the noble Earl would have led that part of that agitation which was going to be carried on in this country. It would have been, I think, a regrettable agitation. It might have led &#x2014;and I myself should greatly have regretted the circumstance, but I should in no way have shrunk from it&#x2014;it might have led to the application to some of the English papers in Calcutta of the extreme rigours of the Press Act, which, of course, might be applied to them as much as to vernacular papers. There would, no doubt, also have been a certain degree of agitation on the lines mentioned by the noble Earl among the Mahornedan inhabitants of Eastern Bengal, although, as I think I can show, the noble Earl in that instance put his colours on somewhat too thickly. Apart from those two communities I do not hesitate to say that all the rest of India would have supported us on the general merits of the scheme as a whole, just as they are supporting us now. I do not think that the opposition, unpleasant though it would have been from every point of view, would have been effective. I do not think it would have brought about the result which, if successful, it would have brought about&#x2014;namely, the disappearance from the scene both of the Viceroy and of myself. But it would have been an agitation of some violence, possibly of some length, and it would have left a great deal of ill-feeling behind it. And I ask, What would have been gained by it? What would have been gained by it even in theory? In obedience to what theory was it necessary to embark on a Press agitation or an agitation by public meeting upon this series of purely administrative acts?<lb/>
Then, my Lords, I come to the next half of the charge of unconstitutional action&#x2014;namely, even supposing for the sake of argument that the noble Earl were to admit, which I am sure he does not, the force of what I have just said, that even then the announcement ought not to have been made at the Delhi Durbar by His Majesty in person. I do not draw any distinction for this purpose, and 1 do not think it is possible to draw any between any announcement made on such an occasion by His Majesty's own lips or made on his behalf and at his command by the Viceroy in his presence. So far as the effect of these two announcements is
<col>174</col>
concerned, the former, of course, weighs more in grandeur and solemnity, but as regards the absolute necessity of carrying out the announcement thus made it would apply not less to an announcement made by the Viceroy at His Majesty's command. It seems, then, to come to this, that the opinion of the noble Earl and those who agree with him is that no announcement ought to be made at Delhi by or on behalf of His Majesty which could cause any difference of opinion in India. If that is so, it seems to me to come very near to saying that no announcement should be made at the Durbar at all, and some colour and support would be given to the views of those&#x2014;I do not think there are many of them left, but there were a good many&#x2014;who considered that His Majesty ought never to have gone to the Durbar at all. You can hardly suggest any form of announcement which could be made at the Durbar which might not be a subject of dispute and even of discontent to a certain number of people in India. Even the most crude, and in the old-fashioned sense the most Oriental form of announcement, that of mere largess, is open to the possible objection that its distribution may cause more discontent than it gives pleasure. The same would apply even more strongly to the remission of any tax, because your Lordships will readily recognise that the remission of one tax may easily cause at least as much discontent as the imposition of another.<lb/>
The answer, surely, to the objection that it was not wise for this announcement to be made by His Majesty at the Durbar is the general gratification which was caused all over India by the fact that this important and, from some points of view, solemn announcement was made on the most solemn occasion that has occurred within the recent history of India. I am convinced that there would have been a feeling all over India of bitter disappointment if it had turned out that the Durbar was merely an occasion for a spectacle of pageantry, however unexampled and however magnificent, that no serious import was to be attached to the unique event of the King-Emperor's visit, and that the whole occasion was simply one of show and of parade. Therefore in our view the occasion and the subject, especially, of course, that of the transfer of the capital, were absolutely wedded together, and to have attempted to shirk the re-
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0113"/>
<col>175</col>
sponsibility of making this announcement on the particular occasion of the Durbar would simply have shown mere timidity on our part&#x2014;a timidity of which I think we should have been fairly and justly accused if within a year or whatever the time might have been which the noble Earl would think a proper interval, we had introduced this policy simply as part of our ordinary administration of the government of India.<lb/>
I pass to the actual question of the change of capital, which I think was the next with which the noble Earl dealt. In one sense, of course, there is no such place as the capital of India, because the seat of government in India is the place in which the Viceroy summons his Council together. But that might almost be described as a verbal quibble, because we have always spoken of Calcutta as the capital although it has been losing its political position in that regard gradually but very markedly during a period now extending over some years. The noble Earl has put forward the claims of Calcutta in glowing terms, and certainly I am not going, in replying to him, to say a word in depreciation of the merits or the historical associations of Calcutta. Still, to anyone who looks at the map of India, it does seem a somewhat singular fact that the Government of India should be carried on for a short period of the year at Calcutta and for the rest of the year at Simla. If one might venture to make an almost fanciful historical parallel it is rather as though, during the great days of the Holy Roman Empire, the government of all Europe had been carried on for about three months of the year from Barcelona and for the rest of the year from St. Moritz or some other village in the higher Alps. The arrangement is in itself a most strange one, and it cannot be disputed that in the minds of a great many educated Indians there is a feeling&#x2014;I think it is a growing one&#x2014;that the stay in the hills has become not merely a question of hot weather migration, but a regular settlement, and that this feeling does more to impress upon their minds the notion that British rule is an alien rule than almost any other feature connected with our Government in India. The noble Earl spoke of the Calcutta community in this regard. The commercial community of Calcutta is a most admirable society, but, like other prosperous and highly considered societies,
<col>176</col>
it has perhaps fallen into the way of looking at matters only from its own point of view, and even has been sometimes tempted to forget that another point of view can exist. It is, of course, an important and a powerful society. When you talk of Calcutta opinion in India, nobody means the opinion of the Government; they mean the opinion of the mercantile community and the Chamber of Commerce. If you wish to indicate Government opinions or Government prejudices, it is as the opinions or the prejudices of Simla that they are described in ordinary parlance.<lb/>
We were given to understand by the noble Earl that in making the change of the capital to Delhi the same objections which had been advanced in many quarters to the long stay of the Government at Simla&#x2014;namely, its isolation from the main current of public life and thought in India&#x2014;will apply to an equal extent. I can quite understand that that danger is one which ought to be guarded against, and no doubt the noble Earl's fear is shared in some quarters, although I think he stated his fear in somewhat exaggerated terms. But, after all, Delhi is not Simla. It is a large city, it is a great emporium of trade, and it is the most important railway junction in India. It is therefore hardly fair, I think, to compare it for this purpose with the charming but isolated settlement in the hills. It is true that it will become the duty of the Government of India, particularly of the Department of Commerce and Industry, to keep in close touch with the main current of Indian opinion, and in some respects it will be in a better position to do so than it has been if the past. The noble Earl knows quite well that it has been complained in other parts of India that in such matters the Government of India has always seen through Calcutta spectacles, and I cannot think that the physical difficulties of the position of Delhi are such that it will not easily be possible for the Government of India to keep well in touch, not merely with Calcutta opinion, to which it ought to continue, of course, to take due account, but also to the opinion of Bombay and of Karachi, to say nothing of the South, which it has been accused of ignoring to some extent in the past. The noble Earl, I think, was less disposed to charge us with ruining Calcutta in a commercial sense than some people have
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0114"/>
<col>177</col>
been. Indeed, that was almost the only point in which I did detect something like a tinge of agreement with what the Viceroy and I stated in our Despatches. I cannot believe for a moment that the commercial interests of Calcutta will suffer in anyway by the change, and I fancy that this is the opinion of the soundest heads in Calcutta itself&#x2014;indeed, some of them are of opinion that their influence upon the new Presidency Government will be more marked, and that they will be able to put their case even more forcibly than they were before the Government of India&#x2014;that, in fact, as the tendency to greater provincial independence, of which the noble Earl spoke at the conclusion of his speech, proceeds to grow, their independence must in some degree grow with it.<lb/>
The noble Earl went on to speak of Delhi as the new seat of government. He described, he will forgive me for saying, in rather appalling terms the position of Delhi as a city of tombs in view of its past history. The only other important transfer of a capital that has taken place in the memory of anybody now alive was also one from a modern city to what may be described as a city of tombs in quite as full a sense as Delhi. Up to 1864 Turin was the capital of the House of Savoy and the State of Piedmont. In that year the transfer of the capital was made to Florence, and by general admission that was a step towards making Rome the capital whenever it became possible. Six years later it did become possible, and Rome, the city of the dead, like Delhi, strewn with the relics of decayed dynasties, became, with the common consent of all Italians, and remains, as we hope it will always remain, the capital of Italy. When the Government of Italy removed to Florence there was great agitation in Turin; there was even some violence. The crowd were fired on, and some loss of life took place. Then one of the most brilliant heroes of the Italian Liberation. General Cialdini, made a speech which has often been remembered from its eloquent appeal to the people of Italy not to set town against town in rivalry but to think of the interests of Italy as a whole. I am bound to say that the tone of that speech was very different from the tone which has been adopted by a great many of the interested advocates of the maintenance of Calcutta as the necessary and perpetual capital of
<col>178</col>
the British Government in India, although I am glad to think that the untoward consequences which followed in Turin from the excitement of the crowd have been in no danger of being followed in Calcutta.<lb/>
The noble Earl very fairly and properly drew attention to the care which would have to be taken in planning the new portion of Delhi with regard to sanitation and the like. I can assure him that we are most desirous to obtain the very best possible advice in that regard, but we shall not move in too great a hurry, although I hope we shall not waste any time, and certainly we shall not run any risk of setting apart for the new capital any part of the environs of Delhi which cannot be thoroughly drained or which is liable to flood, or to which any objection on sanitary grounds is thought to exist. I am in great hopes that we shall succeed in obtaining for the purposes of advice some of the best opinions that are to be found on questions of town engineering and town planning, arid that we shall be able to have those opinions before us before we take any steps of an irrevocable kind towards starting our new buildings. As to the question of water, I can venture to assure the noble Earl that there is no doubt whatever that a copious and good water supply will be certainly obtained for the new portion of Delhi.<lb/>
I do not desire to dwell on the point touched upon by the noble Earl as to the strategical questions raised by the transfer. As he frankly admitted, the case is greatly altered since the Duke of Wellington spoke, when it had to be frankly admitted, even by that heroic personage, that it was necessary for the seat of Government to be somewhere quite close to the coast in order, if the worst came to the worst, that the Viceroy and all his surroundings might be safely packed on board a man-of-war. My Lords, we are a long way from that state of things, and I do not believe that the fears expressed by the noble Earl as to the risks to the Government of India by being so far inland are uniformly held. And when all is said and done the noble Earl will remember that, supposing a state of things were to arise in some form of <i>emeute</i> or some military difficulty which might threaten the Government of India, its position when poised on the hill at Simla would not be very strong,
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0115"/>
<col>179</col>
although, of course, both at Simla and at Delhi it would be in the neighbourhood of a strong force, if force had to be employed.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, I pass on to the strictures of the noble Earl upon the separation of the Government of India from the Government of Bengal. He seemed to think that of the various reasons given in the published Despatches for desiring to divorce those two Governments there was only one of real meaning and substance&#x2014;namely, that it was thought desirable to get the Government of India away from Bengali influence. The noble Earl somewhat challenged me on the particular point that the existing position is bad for the Government of India and the Government of Bengal. My Lords, 1 take up that challenge, and I do so quite deliberately, because in the joint framing of these proposals there was not one which had more influence on my mind than the importance of breaking the association between the Government of India and the Government of Bengal. It so happens that I have had official opportunities of watching the working of a great many different systems of government in the British Empire, all indeed that there are, ranging from the responsible government of the self-governing Dominions to the purely despotic government carried on by Departments in some parts of the Empire&#x2014;despotic except, of course, for the final control of Parliament; and I say without hesitation that in no part of the Empire, and in no part of the world that I know of, can I recall a system which seems to me so ill adapted to stand the stress of a difficult period as the relation which has existed between the Government of India and the Government of Bengal. I say this without making the slightest imputation of a personal character. I have had the pleasure of discussing administrative questions with several of those who have filled at different times the office of Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, and I certainly do not desire to convey the slightest imputation upon them, or still less upon anybody who has been responsible for the Government of India. But when times are difficult there is no fault that you can suggest in a system of government so dangerous as ill-defined responsibility, which is exactly what has occurred in this case.<lb/>
<col>180</col>
The noble Earl stated that he himself did not experience any inconvenience of this kind, but then I believe I am right in saying that during the whole period when he was in relations with Calcutta and Bengal a peaceful state of things existed, and that the great difficulties which have been found in the administration of Bengal had not occurred. Of course, defects of the kind I have stated only become marked and obvious when times are difficult, as they have been on several occasions during the last few years. In this connection I might quote from a Calcutta newspaper, which seems to me to put this part of the case as clearly as one could desire. I quote from the <i>Statesman</i> of January 3 this year. The <i>Statesman</i>, one of the principal Calcutta organs, did not take a favourable view of our proposals, but on reconsideration it modified its view, at any rate to some extent. It said this&#x2014;
<quote>"There are strong arguments in favour of the change, as we pointed out when dealing with the question a fortnight ago. One of these arguments is the increasing difficulty under present-day conditions of retaining Calcutta as the headquarters both of the Imperial Government and of a great Provincial Government. Such an arrangement is bad for both Governments. It means that the Provincial Government is constantly hampered by the interference of the Imperial authorities, and it means that the Imperial Government has much of its time wasted over provincial details. So long as the Government of India and the Government of Bengal have a sort of dual control, provincial autonomy is impossible."</quote>
So that the noble Earl will admit that the Viceroy and I are by no means alone in the opinions we held, as the noble Earl seemed to suppose. And when he goes on to say that because the Punjab Government goes to another place for a portion of the year the same situation arises there, I can only say that so far as my knowledge goes that is not the case. None of the difficult questions with which the Bengal Government and the Government of India have often had to deal jointly, and sometimes, I think, without either side being quite aware into whose province a particular action most properly might fall, can occur or ever have occurred at Simla, and therefore I do not think that the comparison is one which possesses much value.<lb/>
I will only deal briefly with the question of the probable cost of these changes, because this is a matter on which, of course, everybody is entitled to form his own opinion. When the noble Earl tells us that the calculations of cost
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0116"/>
<col>181</col>
instead of being&#x00A3;4,000,000, may rise to&#x00A3;10,000,000, and even up to&#x00A3;12,000,000, which, I understand, is the noble Earl's own figure, unless one could see a thoroughly detailed account of how these estimates have been reached it is very difficult to argue about them. It is only fair to point out that it would not be wise to treat the Delhi estimates in the manner which noble Lords opposite, from their long experience, would naturally be tempted to treat estimates of the kind made by Departments in India. It is, of course, true, and it is within the knowledge of all of us who have had anything to do with the Government of India that the practice of estimating has been in the past, and probably remains to sonic extent, open to no little criticism. The vice of under-estimation has, no doubt, been common, but these matters will not be subject to ordinary departmental control. The Government of India are quite determined to devote, not merely special initial attention, but special continuous control, to the care of the great works which will have to be carried out; and the whole of the works will, 1 hope, be so completely carried out in the light of day that the danger of under-estimation, or of any flagrant excess of cost during the process of construction, will be as far as possible avoided.<lb/>
As the noble Earl pointed out, the taking up of the land is of itself a comparatively small part of the process. The Government of India have announced their intention of taking a very large amount of land in Delhi&#x2014;I think something like 115,000 acres&#x2014;and, owing to the provisions of the land laws of India, which might be found very shocking to many members of your Lordships' House, that land can be obtained for public purposes without any reference to a possible enhancement of its value by reason of the uses to which it or any other neighbouring land may be put. But, on the general question, the estimates of the Government of India do not, of course, profess to be exhaustive for reasons which your Lordships well know, and you are, if you like, entitled to put this down as a further indictment against the secrecy with which the proceedings were conducted in their early stages. But I have not heard anything either here or in India, when one comes to reckon up the class and number of buildings which will have to be erected, which justifies such a vast advance upon those estimates as the noble Earl tells
<col>182</col>
us he himself would make and is made by others. 1 should myself venture to express the hope&#x2014;although it is difficult to speak with certainty, because, as the noble Earl pointed out, although much may be done in three years it is impossible to suppose that all the works in connection with the new capital can be completed in three years&#x2014;that the total result may not largely exceed the sum suggested by the Government of India.<lb/>
I will deal briefly with the other points raised by the noble Earl. He is one of those, I gather, who think that there is something in the Constitution of Bengal or the Bengalis which causes it to differ from other parts of India, at any rate from Bombay and Madras, and makes it desirable therefore that the Bengalis should be ruled by members of the Indian Civil Service and not by a Governor from England as in the case of the other two Presidencies. I confess, my Lords, I do not entirely follow that contention. I quite see&#x2014;of course, it is impossible not to see&#x2014;the force of the argument that when the Viceroy was at Calcutta it would have been a most difficult business to place in Calcutta another Englishman of general experience to carry on a sort of rival Government. As we all know, up to 1853 the Governor-General was also the Governor of Bengal, and when the work was found too heavy for him to compass alone it was the natural course to place a Lieutenant-Governor there. But so far as I am able to gauge the general trend of India n opinion, the appointment of my noble friend Lord Carmichael rather than of some eminent member of the Civil Service has been greatly welcomed in Bengal itself and all over India, except in Madras, where they are exceedingly sorry to lose him owing to the excellent impression as a sensible and sympathetic Governor which he has created even during the short time he was there.<lb/>
As regards Eastern Bengal, I could not help thinking that here again the noble Earl laid on his colours too thickly. It is quite clear that the Mahomedan population of Eastern Bengal cannot like the diminution of the enormous numerical advantage which they possessed in the Province of Eastern Bengal and Assam, and it is no doubt partly true that the fact pointed out by the Viceroy in his Despatch, that they will still claim a
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0117"/>
<col>183</col>
numerical proportion in the whole of the new Presidency, does not mean that they will thereby possess a preponderance of political influence. It has been suggested by some on their behalf that a number of elaborate special arrangements ought to be made by which they would secure preponderance on various public bodies throughout the Presidency, and others by which they would secure a distinct proportion of public offices. I consider, however, that the best way to set to work to correct the balance, so far as it exists, against the Mahomedans in any part of India is to give them, even though it may mean a considerable expenditure of funds, a chance of improving their position on equal terms with their Hindu fellow-subjects. That is best done, as I believe, by increasing their facilities for education. It is one of the most gratifying facts with regard to the Mahomedan community in India that so many of them, not merely a few picked representatives, are becoming alive to the advantages of increased educational facilities, and it would certainly be our earnest desire to bring these facilities within the reach of as ninny of the Mahomedan community as we possibly can. As regards this particular re-partition of Eastern Bengal, the Mahomedan community seem to me to have shown remarkable sense and remarkable self-restraint in the way in which they have taken it. As I have said, it is obvious that they could not like it in itself, but the most representative of them have refused to be alarmed by it, and have altogether refused to join in anything in the nature of an agitation hostile to the Government on the strength of it. The gentleman who was referred to by the noble Earl&#x2014;the Nawab of Dacca, about whom the noble Earl repeated a story, which he will forgive me for describing as a story of gossip, which had not reached me before&#x2014;I know for a fact expressed himself in the most loyal terms as being desirous of assisting the Government in explaining to his co-religionists in Eastern Bengal what the state of affairs really would be under the new arrangements, in order that they might not be inspired by exaggerated fears on the subject.<lb/>
The noble Earl claimed apparently that the institution of the Lieutenant-Governorship of Eastern Bengal and Assam had been a complete and unqualified
<col>184</col>
success. I should naturally desire to give, as he gave, the utmost credit to the able officers who worked that Province. As we know, in India all arrangements of such a character work satisfactorily under the guidance of the able men of different grades of the Service who superintend or look after the various districts, but it seems to me impossible to describe the Province as in itself constituting a great success. In the first place, the combination of Assam with Eastern Bengal has never been liked by Assam. They have never liked having to regard Dacca as their capital, and they have to an increasing extent begun to feel that they were overshadowed by Eastern Bengal, and that their identity was to some extent in danger of disappearing. I believe, therefore, that the re-erection of Assam into an independent Chief Commissionership will be thoroughly popular in Assam itself. I do not at all ignore the difficulty of the small cadre of service, to which the noble Earl drew attention. That, of course, will demand close attention.<lb/>
As regards Eastern Bengal itself, the noble Earl spoke of the improvement which had taken place there as compared with former days when it formed part of a gigantic and overgrown Bengal Government. That is perfectly true. The conditions which obtained there in old days in the way of river piracy undoubtedly constituted a scandal of the first order, but it has been a discouraging feature since the Partition that although the statistics of crime in general will probably show an improvement owing to the multiplication and the greater efficiency of the police, yet as a direct result of the Partition there arose there a practice of gang robbery by land and water by gangs who sailed, so to speak, under the political flag, although there might be strong suspicions that in some cases the object of those who took part in those gangs was not political but mere ordinary robbery. Those gangs were largely composed of young men who belonged to what would he called in a social sense the respectable classes, and it has been impossible to avoid the conclusion that the feuds between Hindus and Mahomedans, of which they were the outcome, were founded upon the Partition of Bengal&#x2014;that is to say, by the creation of Eastern Bengal into a Mahomedan Province&#x2014;and it was found that this class of crime was most difficult to deal with and check. It has been to some extent dealt with and
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0118"/>
<col>185</col>
checked, but only at very great expense and with great difficulty. When speaking, therefore, of Eastern Bengal and Assam as a successfully administered Province, we must make the important qualification that this particular type of crime, at any rate to a very great extent, grew out of the state of things caused by the Partition. The noble Earl admitted that the creation of the new United Province would be a satisfaction to Behar.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00390"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: Before the noble Marquess passes away, might I ask him if he has anything to say about Dacca and the residence of the Governor in future?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00391"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl has reminded me of the question of the residence of the Governor of Bengal at Dacca. I think, if I remember rightly, he said that there were some who thought there ought to be a statutory obligation upon the Governor of Bengal to spend a certain time of the year at Dacca. I do not think myself that it would be possible to place an obligation of that kind upon the Governor. But of this I am quite certain, that the new Governor-General of Bengal and the Viceroy, with whom he will no doubt discuss the question of residence, will be convinced that it will be necessary in order to hold the proper balance between the different parts of the Province, and to avoid slipping back into the unfortunate state of things before the partition, to spend a certain part of the year at that place. I entirely agree that we ought to impress it upon the Governor of Bengal, as I am sure it will be impressed, and I have no doubt. it will be in full conformity with his own feelings, that, in spite of the magnet which may draw him on the one side to Calcutta and on the other, as the noble Earl said, to Darjeeling, his visits to Dacca should not be merely those of a flying kind but should show that he treats it as a second headquarters for his Presidency.<lb/>
I need not dwell upon Behar. But the noble Earl somewhat surprised me by speaking of Orissa as likely to object strongly to the new arrangements. If the noble Earl had said that instead of creating a Lieutenant-Governorship at Behar and Orissa it would have been a more proper
<col>186</col>
course to create two separate Commissioner-ships, one for Behar and one for Orissa, that would have been quite an arguable position, although I think the weight of argument would be in favour of creating a Lieutenant-Governorship, which to some extent falls in with the suggestion which was made by Sir George Campbell, a very eminent Indian official, some forty years ago. But when the noble Earl implies, as I think he did, that Orissa would rather remain tied up with Bengal than be tied up with Behar, I confess he caused me some surprise. I think that there may be some fear among the people of Orissa that their particular interests may not receive from the Lieutenant-Governor all the attention which those of Behar receive, and when the question of the second residence of the Lieutenant-Governor comes to be considered I have no doubt that the point will have to be carefully borne in mind. But I can assure the noble Earl that I have plenty of first-hand knowledge that the association of Orissa with Bengal had become from many points of view most unpalatable to Orissa. Since the publication of our scheme I had an opportunity of speaking to some of the most prominent men of Orissa, and although they expressed strong hopes that in the final arrangement Orissa would not be allowed to be overshadowed by Behar, with which I cordially agree, none of them expressed any regret at being severed from Bengal or from Calcutta, the influence of which, I think, like some of the other neighbouring peoples, as the noble Earl himself has told us, they had somewhat begun to dread.<lb/>
In considering the merits, or, if you prefer so to regard them, the demerits of this scheme, it is necessary to regard it as a whole&#x2014;to regard the balance of its different parts. The noble Earl seemed to give some colour to the belief, founded only, I think, on the dates of the two Despatches, that the whole matter had been carried out in a spirit of hurry, which he truly pointed out is foreign both to the Government of India and to the India Office. As a matter of fact, the consideration of the question began rather more than a year ago, and during the whole of that period in all its bearings it was the subject of the closest thought and of the freest consideration within the limited area of discussion to which it was intentionally kept. It is quite true, as I say, that the area of advice we obtained was
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0119"/>
<col>187</col>
a small one, but within those limits it was of a solid and thoroughly well informed character. All through, as it seemed to me, the main question that we had to ask, particularly when the discussion reached the point at which it became likely that we should suggest the announcement of the policy on the occasion of the Durbar, was <i>cui malo</i>. Who were the people that would have a right to say that their interests were in any degree compromised or injured by the new policy? It was quite possible, of course&#x2014;and that is why it was necessary to consider the matter in all its bearings&#x2014;that the injuries inflicted upon some classes of persons might be so grave, in the opinion of impartial observers, as to outweigh any benefits which could be obtained from the change. That I gather to be the opinion of the noble Earl. But I honestly believe that he will find himself a member of a very small minority, even in this country; and I am quite sure that if he were in India he would find himself a member of an almost infinitesimal minority, because I believe that the general reasons given in the two Despatches from the Government of India and the India Office are regarded by public opinion in India as conclusively showing that the benefits to be obtained from the change are greater than any damage either of substance or of sentiment which can be sustained by any class of people in the country. I therefore state without hesitation that, in spite of the powerful and well-directed attacks of the noble Earl, I remain entirely unrepentant both as to the general features of the scheme as described in the two Despatches and also as to the fact that the policy had the honour of being announced by His Majesty the King in Durbar at Delhi.<lb/>
And since, after all, the opinion of India is what really matters in this as in most other matters with which the Indian Government is concerned, I desire to remind your Lordships of the very remarkable Message which was sent from India after His Majesty had left and which was published in the newspapers on the day on which His Majesty reached England. That Message was unique and unprecedented in the respect that it represented the spontaneous and joint action of the Indian Princes and of those who in one way or another are well entitled to speak for the educated opinion of British India. It was organised by some of the most power-
<col>188</col>
ful and representative, and also, I think, some of the most conservative, among Indian rulers; and it was also authorised by some of those who are spoken of as the most representative among the advanced politicians in India, and the form of expression in which it reached us 1 believe was due to one of the latter class. Its sentiments are of a kind with which we should all heartily agree and which we all admire. I do not think it attracted the attention which it might have attracted in this country, because, very naturally and properly, it was sent through the Viceroy, and it was therefore supposed, I imagine, to possess something of an official colour, but as a matter of fact it had nothing whatever to do with the Viceroy or the Government of India. I conceive that the Viceroy did not even know of the movement or of the intention of the writers until the whole matter was settled and the public meetings were called. I think we are entitled to take that Message, sent in such unique circumstances, not as necessarily approving every detail of the policy which was announced at Delhi, but as expressing what I believe to be, and what I am prepared to say I know, is the general opinion of all classes in India, both in British India and in the native States&#x2014;namely, that the making of this announcement by His Majesty at Delhi was one of the great and most notable features of the occasion; and that the kind of criticism which has been suggested by the noble Earl and by some others, namely, that in offering our advice to His Majesty to make this announcement on that occasion we were committing a breach of propriety, and, indeed, doing whatever may be meant by that somewhat vague word unconstitutional, has not entered the mind of the Indian people as a whole, or of those who, either in British India or in the native States, are entitled to speak as their representatives.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00396">Debate on the Motion of Earl Curzon of Kedleston "That an humble Address be presented to His Majesty for Papers relating to the removal of the capital of India to Delhi, and other connected matters" <i>resumed</i> (according to Order).</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00397"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MINTO</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is the first occasion on which I have had the honour of addressing your Lordships since I returned from India, and I confess that in many ways I should have preferred not to have taken part in this debate at all. Indeed, I wish, for reasons which are no doubt patent to your Lordships, that it had been possible to avoid altogether the discussion of the points which were raised yesterday by the noble Earl, Lord Curzon of Kedleston, but at the same time I do feel very strongly that it would have been quite unjustifiable to refrain from the discussion of the policy of His Majesty's Government, affecting vast changes of momentous Imperial importance. I also feel that as the last member of your Lordships' House who has had the honour to hold the high position of Viceroy of India, and who has been so lately intimately connected with her public affairs, I am not entitled to keep silent.<lb/>
Unfortunately, my Lords, any criticism on the policy we are considering, which was quite unknown to us until it was divulged in His Majesty's pronouncement at the Durbar at Delhi, runs the risk of being mistaken in India as a criticism of His Majesty's personal action, and indirectly of their Majesties' visit to India, than which I am sure nothing could be further from your Lordships' intention. Therefore the position is a very delicate one. His Majesty's Government are answerable for it, and I venture to think that it ought never to have arisen. It would be a calamity if anything said in this House should in the slightest degree mar the magnificent results of their Majesties' visit to India. The greatness of the Imperial idea which prompted that
<col>190</col>
visit, the determination with which the King persisted in it in the face of great difficulties, the courage with which their Majesties faced much hard work and exertion and not a little personal risk, has certainly won our admiration, whilst the magnificent reception they everywhere received from their Indian subjects of every nationality, of every religion, and of every caste, bears ample testimony to the loyal devotion of India to the Throne which their Majesties' sympathetic personality has done so much to confirm.<lb/>
It was my lot, my Lords, to serve for five anxious years in India. They were years of political unrest, when the political atmosphere was dangerously electric. My noble friend the noble Viscount opposite, Lord Morley, knows well the stress of those times, and I shall always be grateful to him for the spirited support he was ever ready to give me. But before I sailed from home great administrative reforms had been introduced and many of the just claims of India had been recognised. Much had already been done to restore public confidence in the justice of British rule, and a dangerous smouldering discontent was everywhere giving way to a more friendly feeling. It was one of the most marvellous changes I ever saw. I can assure you that one could feel the differ once in one's work every day; one knew that everything was on a more friendly and happier footing. But, my Lords, something more was wanted, something that would impress upon the people of India that they, together with their British fellow-subjects, owed allegiance to the same great King, that they were together secure of his constant sympathy, and that they together shared in the interests of one great Empire; and I earnestly hope that the visit of their Majesties to India will have stamped the relations of British and Indian populations with the seal of a lasting friendship.<lb/>
In <i>The Times</i> of February 5 there was published a "Message from the Princes and people of India to the people of Great Britain and Ireland." The noble Marquess opposite alluded to it yesterday, but to me it seems that it has scarcely attracted the public attention it deserves, and if your Lordships will allow me I will read a few lines from the Message. After conveying "to the great English nation an
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0121"/>
<col>191</col>
expression of their cordial goodwill and fellowship," the Message continued&#x2014;
<quote>"Their Imperial Majesties, by their gracious demeanour, their unfailing sympathy, and their deep solicitude for the welfare of all classes, have drawn closer the bonds that unite England and India, and have deepened and intensified the traditional feeling of loyalty and devotion to the Throne and Person of the Sovereign which has always characterised the Indian people."</quote>
And the Message concluded with these weighty words&#x2014;
<quote>"They are confident that this great and historic event marks the beginning of a new era ensuring greater happiness, prosperity, and progress to the people of India under the aegis of the Crown."</quote>
In the face of such welcome evidence of so much good work one cannot be too cautious in approaching the policy of His Majesty's Government pronounced by the King at Delhi&#x2014;a policy involving the removal of the capital from Calcutta to Delhi and other connected matters to which the noble Earl, Lord Curzon, drew attention yesterday.<lb/>
I have no intention of attempting to deal in detail with the points under discussion. I would rather confine myself to a very few remarks as to the manner in which any previous knowledge of this great 6cheme was withheld from the British and Indian public until it had been announced as an accepted policy, which, without any opportunity whatever of considering it, they were expected to approve. I readily admit that there is much that is attractive in the removal of the seat of Government from Calcutta to Delhi. Delhi is the capital of the old Mogul Empire, and its history is replete with traditions of the past&#x2014;Hindu, Mahomedan, and British. I have often discussed the possibility of such a change. I have no doubt other Viceroys have done the same. 1 was well aware of the cordial welcome any such suggestion would receive from the great Chiefs of Central India and of Rajputana, and it is impossible to disregard the advantages of removing the enlarged Legislative Councils from the political surroundings of Calcutta. But, on the other hand, the interests of Calcutta cannot with justice be ignored&#x2014;the interests of great mercantile houses and of tradesmen. There is also the question of expense, which is bound to be enormous, for I altogether disregard the estimate of the Government of India. There were sanitary considerations to be thought of,
<col>192</col>
sanitary considerations which appear only lately to have dawned on the Government of India and His Majesty's Government. There are also strategical considerations as to the best locality for the capital of India from a military point of view, as to which the best military expert opinion was an Imperial necessity; whilst surely the fact that Calcutta has been for 150 years the capital of our Eastern Empire, and that her history is gloriously associated with the deeds of Clive and Warren Hastings and with the names of many great British administrators since those times&#x2014;surely considerations such as these entitle Calcutta to more serious consideration. His Majesty's Government seem ready enough to recognise Bengali sentiment. Surely British historical sentiment has a claim not to be disregarded. Throughout the meagre correspondence which has so far been submitted to us between the Government of India and His Majesty's Government I am sorry to say I find very little trace of a due appreciation of the grave issues involved in any removal of the capital from Calcutta to Delhi.<lb/>
The same secrecy has been maintained in respect to the reorganisation of the Province of Bengal. Lord Curzon's partition of Bengal had become law before I arrived in India, and I do not think I am called upon in any way to deal with its merits or its demerits. I listened yesterday with the greatest interest to what the noble Earl told us of the careful study which preceded the introduction of his partition legislation, of the thought which was devoted to it, and of his apprehensions in regard to the future results of a reconsideration of that partition. I am bound to say, my Lords, that I agree with all the history he told us of that legislation, and I share with him in the apprehension that he expressed as to future results of its reconsideration. But, though I had nothing to do with the legislation effecting the partition, I did see a great deal of the aftermath&#x2014;the aftermath of unrest, dangerous unrest&#x2014;that followed in its wake. And during those years of unrest I naturally had peculiar opportunities of knowing what was going on behind the scenes and of forming some judgment as to the genuineness of the so-called national agitation which was in many ways encouraged to rally to the cry of partition. And notwith-
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0122"/>
<col>193</col>
standing the extraordinary and belated discovery of the Government of India as to the resentment about the partition which they tell us is still as strong as ever in both the Bengals, I unhesitatingly assert that there was hardly any genuine national feeling whatever in the Bengal movement. The original agitation in Bengal really was in close touch with a subterranean and dangerous agitation which had been in existence for some years in India, and which had not had the opportunity of showing itself above ground before Lord Curzon's partition legislation was introduced. When that was introduced it became a very useful cry to party agitators.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00398"><member>LORD MAC DONNELL of SWINFORD</member><membercontribution>: Will the noble Earl mention the date from which this subterranean agitation took its rise?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00399"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MINTO</member><membercontribution>: Roughly it was three or four years before the partition, which became a useful peg upon which political agitators could hang their grievances. I can assure your Lordships that when I left India the agitation against partition was stone dead. I do not believe that there was a political agitator in Bengal, of whatever influence, who could have collected a representative gathering on the question. I feel bound, in justice to what I know of Lord Curzon's partition, to say what I have.<lb/> Throughout my term of office the Government of India warmly supported Lord Curzon's policy in the Bengals. We were told from home that "partition" was a "settled fact." We over and over again asserted that it must continue to be so. We assured the Mahomedan population of Eastern Bengal of our appreciation of their loyalty and our determination to safeguard their interests. I should think there is scarcely a Civil servant in India who has not declared that it would be impossible for any British Government to reverse the decision it had come to. Only last summer during the Coronation festivities 1 was approached by a distinguished Bengali leader, who asked if, in view of the King's visit to India, there was no possibility of a reversal of Lord Curzon's partition, and I told him that no Government of India could ever entertain the idea of such a thing. And now the declarations of the Government
<col>194</col>
of India, repeated over and over again since 1905. have been disowned, with no opportunity for any expression of opinion from the public in India or at home. Such a policy can but depreciate the reputation of British rule in India.<lb/>
I should like to say a word about one particular point in the changes that are to be made, and that is as regards the gift of presidency government to Bengal. With due respect to the members of this House who have so ably administered the affairs of great presidencies, I confess that it is a form of government of which I am not enamoured. I have always disliked the right it possesses to communicate direct with the Secretary of State, which I do not think conducive to the authority of the paramount power in India. Bengal is full of advanced political thought and of political ramifications which the greatest Indian expert would find difficulty in unravelling. Owing to the great increase of postal and telegraph communication, it has now become possible for correspondence to be carried on between Bengali politicians and politicians in this country, and I can assure your Lordships that in the anxious times with which I had to deal this correspondence was one of my greatest difficulties. The opinions sent home by this. I do not like to call it back-stair correspondence, but unofficial correspondence, carried on between Bengali agitators of very doubtful reputation and politicians in this country, were taken far above their value here, and were accepted as representing the views of the Indian populations as a whole, which they were very far from doing. This correspondence became, as I have said, one of the greatest difficulties with which we had to deal. And if an English statesman with no knowledge of Indian affairs is sent to Bengal, however broad-minded he may be, with the power of corresponding directly with the Secretary of State, whilst at the same time the communication between political parties in Bengal and this country, to which I have alluded continues, I apprehend that as years go on the result will be the administration of Bengal from home instead of by the Viceroy and the Government of India, than which I cannot conceive any greater danger. I can find only one explanation for what has been clone. A sop has been given to a certain faction in Bengal as a recompense for the removal of the capital from Calcutta to Delhi.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0123"/>
<col>195</col>
The key to the position created by His Majesty's Government appears to be contained in a few lines of Paragraph 24 in the Government of India's Despatch of August 25. They say&#x2014;
<quote>"In the event of these far-reaching proposals being sanctioned by His Majesty's Government, as we trust may be the case, we are of opinion that the presence of His Majesty the King-Emperor at Delhi would offer a unique opportunity for a pronouncement of one of the most weighty decisions ever taken since the establishment of British rule in India."</quote>
One of the most weighty decisions since the establishment of British rule in India was to be taken without consultation with a single soul in India outside the Viceroy's Council, and without the advice of a single public man in this country, no matter how specially qualified he might be to give it. For the sake of a unique opportunity the Government of India and His Majesty's Government decided to ignore their responsibility to the public in India and at home. That is the position His Majesty's Government appear to me so unfortunately to have brought about. I have not attempted to deal in any detail with their scheme. I have endeavoured to limit myself to a criticism of the secrecy&#x2014;the unconstitutional secrecy&#x2014;with which they have withheld from the public all possible consideration of it. Much as I regret the necessity for this debate, I cannot see how on public grounds your Lordships could justifiably have refrained from any discussion of such momentous decisions affecting our Indian Empire.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00400"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD REAY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, after the very interesting speech which we have heard from my noble friend on the Cross Benches, perhaps the House will allow me to express rather a different view of the policy of His Majesty's Government. The transfer of the capital to Delhi seems to me to be completely justified. I need hardly tell the noble Earl opposite that I have no "sneaking satisfaction" at the so-called dethronement of Calcutta. I never noticed while I was in Bombay the slightest rivalry between Calcutta and Bombay. A central residence for the Imperial. Government, detached from any Local Government, has always been considered desirable by the advocates of decentralisation in India. To restrict the interference of the Central Government with Local Governments, to limit it to questions of general policy as distinct from mere administrative detail, has always been the aim of experienced
<col>196</col>
Indian administrators whom I have known. If proper attention is to be given to the growing needs of Indian agriculture, Indian industries, Indian education, Indian finance, decentralisation is essential. The main lines of administrative policy must be laid down by the Central Government, but in order to carry it out in accordance with local traditions it must be left to the Local Governments. You must leave them as much latitude as you can, and that is what I understand is aimed at in the Despatch of the Government of India when they state that their policy is in the direction of autonomy&#x2014;autonomy restricted, as mentioned in the Despatch, to provincial affairs. The transfer of the capital to Delhi will undoubtedly promote this tendency of making the local administrations more autonomous in all provincial affairs. From some important parts of the country the Government of India will be more accessible, as for instance from Bombay and Karachi. I do not think that at Delhi the Government of India will take a less interest in the great commercial an I industrial questions which ought to engage its attention. The Imperial Legislative Council, which, of course, will meet at Delhi, will certainly keep the Government in touch with Indian public opinion.<lb/>
With regard to the Partition of Bengal, I think we ought to accept the statement in the Despatch of the Government of India to this effect&#x2014;
<quote>"Every one with any true desire for the peace and prosperity of the country must wish to find some manner of appeasement if it is in any way possible to do so."</quote>
This appeasement, I think, has been found by the decision of the Government in redistributing the partition. I have heard those who were not prepared for the redistribution admit that if it had been done originally on the lines on which it has now been reconstituted, they would have preferred it. There is no doubt that this new redistribution has given general satisfaction in India. I am not at all apprehensive as regards the interests of the Mahomedans in the new province of Bengal. The Mahomedan community in India is fully alive to the importance of educating members of their community, and I have no doubt that the Government of Bengal will look after their interests and meet their wishes as far as possible. I do not think there will be any difficulty in transferring the seat of Government to
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0124"/>
<col>197</col>
Dacca for part of the year. The fact is, the Bengal Governor will be in the same position as the Governor of Bombay, who resides part of the year in Bombay, part of the year at Poona. and part of the year at Mahablishwar. The situation in Bengal will be identical.<lb/>
As to the constitution of a Governor in Council for the new Province in Bengal, it was clearly always an anomaly that Bombay and Madras should have a Governor in Council, and that with regard to the Province which is, perhaps, the most difficult to administer in India, you should be satisfied with a Lieutenant-Governor. That anomaly was intensified when you gave to the Lieutenant-Governor a Council. It seems to me an advantage to appoint to the office of Governor men who have been in touch with public opinion here. They bring another element into the administration. Taking into account the complexity of the problems which arise in the government of millions of His Majesty's subjects in India, it seems very desirable to introduce that extraneous influence, and I have heard it admitted by very experienced Civil servants of the Crown in India that they looked upon this element as one which was very useful. Especially now that you have introduced into the Legislative Councils a more representative element there is always a certain risk of difference of opinion between the official and the non-official members, and it is obvious that a man who has been trained in public life here will in such circumstances exercise a beneficial influence. Then I would lay stress on another matter of the greatest importance, and that is in connection with the social intercourse between the representatives of the British and of the native communities. There is an advantage in having in India carefully selected administrators with experience of affairs gained here.<lb/>
Now I must say a word on a matter on which, much to my surprise, nothing has been said up to now. I wish to say how pleased I was to see, among the announcements made at the Durbar at Delhi, that loyal native officers, men, and reservists of His Majesty's Indian Army are henceforth to be eligible for the Victoria Cross. This recognition of the meritorious services rendered by the Native Army was thoroughly deserved, and will, I have no doubt, be keenly appreciated throughout
<col>198</col>
India. The fact that 50 lacs are to be spent on truly popular education is a very salient admission of the great need, especially in the rural districts of India, of more schools and better remuneration of the teachers. That is a measure which will be generally welcomed in India.<lb/>
With regard to the method of the announcement of these very important reforms, I think His Majesty's Government were absolutely justified in giving to that announcement its solemn character on a very solemn occasion. In India and here the all-pervading sentiment has been one of recognition of the great service rendered to the Empire by the King-Emperor in giving such a signal proof of his personal interest in the welfare of his Indian subjects. [t was a statesmanlike conception that the King-Emperor should himself announce to his Indian subjects measures so well calculated to impress them with his solicitude for their welfare. The outburst of loyalty which everywhere in India hailed their Majesties was spontaneous and sincere, and it certainly strengthened the constitution and foundations of British rule in India. A statement from the Throne of a policy for which the Government accepts the full responsibility is in every respect Constitutional, whether delivered at Delhi or here in His Majesty's Gracious Speech from the Throne in opening Parliament. In both cases there is no departure from strictly Constitutional practice. Parliament retains the power of criticising the Government's policy, and will not be prevented from doing so when the Bill for the constitution of the new Provinces is submitted for its consideration. The Government seem to me to have given to the ceremony at Delhi a high and exceptional significance. It was an unprecedented event in the brilliant annals of India, and I think that my noble friend the Secretary of State for India and the Viceroy and their advisers are sincerely to be congratulated on a policy which was so well conceived and so admirably carried out, and which I think will have effects- of lasting value for the benefit of India.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00401"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HARRIS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise with some hesitation to address your Lordships on this highly important subject. We are some way on into t he second night of this debate, and, with the exception of my noble friend opposite, your Lordships have heard this subject discussed by ex-Viceroys
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0125"/>
<col>199</col>
and Secretaries of State alone, and there are other high officials who have filled the same position to follow. It may therefore seem somewhat presumptuous in one who has not attained that conspicuous position to venture to offer any remarks, especially as I am one of that batch of officials whom the Government of India has, by unearthing a dry-as-dust description, labelled as persons of no conspicuous ability. But having had a hereditary connection with India in official life for four consecutive generations and for over 120 years, perhaps I may venture to ask your Lordships to listen to my views for a few moments.<lb/>
The noble Earl who initiated this debate divided the subject into several heads, and on one or two of those I should not offer any remark at all except from the attitude of a layman. I know India too well to venture to offer any criticism about a part of India with which I am not personally acquainted, and therefore on the subject of the wisdom of the divisions into which Bengal and Assam have now been parted and were parted in the time of the noble Earl I do not venture to offer any serious criticism. But it did seem to me that the noble Earl, in his speech last night, did step very delicately over a series of incidents which I think must have had some effect on the minds of the Government of India and the Secretary of State&#x2014;incidents which not only attracted attention in this country but caused a great deal of the most serious apprehension. After all, it is not for the best that your Chief Magistrate in the country, a person upon whom a huge responsibility rests, should, I will not say be under any apprehension or anxiety, but that he should be in doubt, when he goes out for his morning ride or his evening drive, whether he will be able to take it without incidents which at any rate are offensive if they are nothing worse, and the state of Calcutta's streets for some time was such that I doubt very much whether the Viceroy could take his exercise in the open or without a considerable addition to that restriction which, of course, must always limit the activities of persons of very high position. And therefore I am not surprised that the Government of India eventually made up their minds that the occasional residence, for, after all, it is only that, for two or three months in the year of the Viceroy in Calcutta was no longer necessary. It was not an essential part of the successful government of India, and
<col>200</col>
it was very possible that in another part of India he might be able to do quite as much, if not more, good than he could do by this occasional residence in Calcutta. I do not dwell upon that part of the case, because I have not any experience of Bengal.<lb/>
As regards Calcutta itself as the seat of the offices of Government, or what in India is called the Secretariat, I do not imagine that it will make very much difference whether the Secretariat is at Calcutta or at. Delhi. For a large part of the year a considerable number of the officials must be at Simla, and if they can be for a longer time outside Simla and more get-at-able than they are at Simla, I do not. think anybody will be any the worse. I can assure the noble Earl, Lord Curzon, that in anything I may say as regards Calcutta as the seat of the Viceroy and his Council I am no more actuated by any sneaking satisfaction at those offices leaving Calcutta than he has been, I am sure, by any feeling of chagrin that the scheme which has always been attributed to him, whether rightly or wrongly, has been, after a few years' experience, altered. Calcutta is not, on the whole, going to be injured by this change. I dare say there are a few people who will be injured in pocket, as the noble Earl said. Owners of ground rents, I dare say, will not receive as fine returns as they have been doing of late, but the commerce of Calcutta is not going to be upset by the change of the seat of Government. The same goods and produce will flow into Calcutta and will flow out of it as before. There will be no attraction away from Calcutta by reason of the seat of Government being in Delhi, and I assure the noble Earl, if it is suggested that anything one may say on those lines is actuated by satisfaction, that I have never heard any real jealousy of Calcutta expressed by the merchants of Bombay. They are perfectly capable of looking after themselves and will continue to do their best to get trade to flow into Bombay and not to Calcutta or Karachi, just the same as the merchants of Calcutta and Karachi will continue to do their best for Calcutta and Karachi respectively, but there is no trade jealousy other than that ordinary trade jealousy which exists and always will exist between commercial cities. Therefore from the two points of view which I have ventured to touch upon, 1 confess to some slight amusement that so much
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0126"/>
<col>201</col>
should have been made of the change. The noble Earl laid stress on the question of whether Delhi occupied a good strategical position, and it certainly did not seem to me that he strengthened his argument by being able to find no authority for that opinion nearer than the Duke of Wellington.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00402"><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: I could have given a great many.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00403"><member>LORD HARRIS</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl did not quote them. The one he quoted goes a long way back&#x2014;to pre-railway, pre-telegraph, and pre-telephone days. I can imagine that some strategists might hold the opinion that a place which is about equidistant from the three principal ports, Bombay. Calcutta, and Karachi, is by no means a hid strategical position from whatever point of view you regard a strategical position. It seems to me it is a good strategical position in that at Delhi India is able to turn either to the East or to the West to important ports close to which those Fleets can lie which are her real protection except from the extreme North or North-east. And I do think that the noble Earl has overlooked this possibility, that the Government of India will not be so long seated upon those heights at Simla, but will for a longer period of the year be in more immediate touch with the Presidencies and Provinces of India, and it may be possible, therefore, for the Viceroy to see rather more of the Presidencies and Provinces than he has of late. I know all the difficulties of getting away from the office, from those masses of papers which flow in in consequence of the inquisitiveness of the British Parliament. I quite appreciate all that difficulty, but no one can be more conscious of the great factor of personal influence than the noble Earl himself, and I do believe that the Government of India would be all the better and difficulties would be simplified if the chief person in the country moved about the country rather more actively than he is able to do when for so many months of the year lie is lodged on the heights at Simla.. It is possible that he may be able to do that if for the greater part of the year he. is resident in a place like Delhi, which is so well served by the railway,<lb/>
Turning back for one moment to the point of making a Presidency in Bengal, I am not surprised at the noble Earl who has addressed your Lordships to-night
<col>202</col>
preferring the system of a Provincial Government. He sat alongside it for five years, and if he and the noble Earl will forgive me, I assure them that there is an opinion outside of Bengal that the Viceroy of India would be very much better if he was not constantly so close to the Government of Bengal. There is quite a strong opinion in India that the Viceroy and his councillors and the opinions come to are largely affected by the fact of their being too much in Bengal and too much liable to the opinions of those who govern Bengal. Which is the better system of Government&#x2014;a Presidency or a Provincial Government&#x2014;is very largely a matter of opinion, but at any rate I may congratulate that unfortunate band who have been dealt with by the Government of India as I have already described upon the fact that Sir Henry Mayne acknowledged that they had done their work, which was the administration of those Provinces, fairly well, and, indeed, better than in the case of the Provinces which had been administered by those Indian civilians who had been promoted.<lb/>
I quite agree with my noble friend opposite that you want occasionally some fresh blood let into the system of the Government of India. I do not think any one can admire a service more than I admire the Indian Civil Service. I think they are magnificent. Their readiness to take responsibility is unequalled in any part of the world, and their ability is unquestioned. Their capacity for argument is unlimited, and they are, without exception I should say, the most obstinate men that any official can come across. I do think that they want that obstinacy occasionally qualified by somebody who does not belong to the Indian Civil Service, and that is obtained by the introduction of fresh blood from England, the introduction of men who frequently have had some official experience which may, perhaps, not be as long as that of the colleagues whom they find there but is more varied, and therefore I am afraid I cannot agree with the noble Earl on the Cross-Benches as to this change, which is one of the many things he has so emphatically condemned. I am afraid also that I am not able to take the gloomy view of these important decisions which the noble Earl on the Front Opposition Bench does. He spoke in sepulchral tones of some of these alterations, and occasionally with bated
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0127"/>
<col>203</col>
breath. I was in India when they were announced, and for some little time afterwards, and making every cautious allowance for the glamour and the success of all the ceremonies which surrounded the announcement, I confess, after many conversations with Europeans and civilians, that I did not find any one possessing the fear and apprehensions that the noble Earl possesses.<lb/>
I will not attempt to argue the Constitutional side of the question. The noble Marquess and his colleague have to defend themselves on the point of whether it was a grave Constitutional departure. I do not know that it was anything worse than when Mr. Disraeli, as he then was, brought Indian troops to the Mediterranean. That was a very bold departure from precedent, and perhaps from Constitutional usage, but it seemed to me last night that the noble Marquess the Secretary of State brought forward one or two cases in which my noble friend below me was concerned which were almost, if not quite, parallel to this case. My Lords, I should be inclined to describe the action of the Secretary of State in authorising what has been done as a very magnificent piece of presumption which has been justified by results. In fact, judging by the results, I think one might almost describe it as a stroke of genius. At any rate, to judge by what we hear from India, and by what I saw in India, I cannot escape the conclusion that the whole scheme was received there with considerable gratification&#x2014;I am not alluding to one particular part of the scheme more than another&#x2014;and that there was a sense of greater comfort than there had been before the announcement was made.<lb/>
My Lords, India is advancing very fast, particularly in the social relations of nationalities and of sexes. The changes that I observed were quite remarkable after an absence of sixteen years, and showed that there was a far greater interchange of opinion between castes, between sexes, and between nationalities than was possible at the time when I was officially connected with that country. And I do think that if these important changes had really been of the disastrous character which the noble Earl would have your Lordships believe, there must have been some manifestation of it, if not publicly at any rate privately when there was an interchange of the most confidential dis-
<col>204</col>
cussions between old friends. India is not unaccustomed to changes of capital; indeed, one would be safer in saying that India is accustomed to changes of capital; and, curiously enough, when a change takes place there always is and always has been for many centuries a tendency to drift back to the neighbourhood of Delhi. That has to some extent engrained itself, I believe, in the minds of the people of India, and I do not think that the idea of the Viceroy going to Delhi is in any way an unpopular thing there. On the contrary, it seemed to me from what I heard on all sides that it was an extremely popular move in almost all parts of India; and certainly not only from people on the western side of India but from people coming from Bengal I heard the most confident statements that this was going to be made a success. That sounded to me very much as if there was sentiment at the bottom of such a confident statement, and we know that with Oriental races sentiment is a very important factor.<lb/>
I believe that the whole of the incidents of the visit of their Majesties&#x2014;the magnificence of the ceremonies, seen by millions of people who will go back to their villages and tell other millions more that they have been almost within touching distance of their Majesties; the evidence of the profound reverence for authority which was displayed after the Durbar, when thousands of humble spectators, after their Majesties had withdrawn and after the troops had withdrawn, raced across the arena and threw themselves in humble prostration before the Throne; the magnificent organisation and respect shown at the fete held by their Majesties afterwards when they sat in their robes upon the ramparts of the Fort&#x2014;all those incidents seen by millions of people and described by them to other millions have permeated through the whole of India. And I believe that the various incidents connected with this ceremony&#x2014;the transfer to that scene of the Government and the Viceroy; the alterations in the outline of Bengal, which, after all, one must admit have been received with satisfaction by prominent persons in Bengal whose opinion is of importance&#x2014;I believe that all these incidents are grouped together in the minds of the people of India as one great act of the Sovereign, and have created a profound sentiment of reverence for their Majesties. I believe that these changes need not be
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0128"/>
<col>205</col>
regarded by your Lordships with the apprehension with which the noble Earl would wish you to regard them, but, on the contrary, may be confidently looked forward to as beneficial changes in our system of government in India. The peoples of that country honestly believe that these changes have been made in accordance with their sentiments and their respect and reverence for the authority of England has been increased.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00404"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl, Lord Curzon, speaking yesterday with that eloquence and force which he has taught your Lordships' House always to expect from him, stated that he would discuss his Motion under four heads. The first head he raised was the Constitutional question. He next dealt with the question of the Partition of Bengal, defending his policy in regard to that business. He passed on, in the third place, to a condemnation of the present arrangements in Bengal; and he ended his speech with an attack upon the removal of the capital from Calcutta to Delhi. I propose, my Lords, as briefly as I can, to follow the noble Earl through these four heads, and I am sorry to say that I shall have to express opinions at variance with his upon every point. I do so with the most unfeigned regret, because I regard and always have regarded with the utmost admiration and respect the noble Earl's commanding intellectual gifts and his lofty ideals of Government.<lb/>
On the Constitutional question, my Lords, I will say but little. 1 am not an expert on Constitutional matters, and I desire to hasten on to the points of which I have special knowledge. But this I may say, that I am in full agreement with the remarks which have fallen from the noble Lord opposite, Lord Harris, in connection with the Durbar at Delhi, and with the necessity of the pronouncement which was then made. There cannot be any doubt that a pronouncement of a far-reaching and unique character was expected from His Majesty's presence in India. I will go so far as to say that the great Durbar at Delhi would have missed its object if some pronouncement., far beyond the common, coming home to the feelings of every person in India, from Prince to peasant., had not been made by His Majesty. Such a pronouncement was made, and it has changed the whole current of thought in
<col>206</col>
India from unrest and discontent to peace and loyalty.<lb/>
As to the secrecy which, in the noble Earl's opinion, attended the procedure of the Government of India, 1 must say that I myself cannot understand how any other procedure would have been suitable or appropriate to the circumstances. If a charge of secrecy of procedure is to be levelled at anybody in connection with these transactions, it is to be levelled against the Government of India in regard to the original partition of Bengal. I have examined these Papers with great care, and I find that the first intimation given of an impending partition of Bengal was made in the letter of the Government of India of 3rd December, 1903. There the earlier policy and objects of the Government of India were clearly set forth for the information of all concerned. They met with the utmost opposition from every class and from every section of the community. European, Mahomedan, Hindu, all combined to say, "This is not the policy which we want; this is a policy which divides us; it is a policy which will lead to constant friction and to the deterioration of the country." The noble Earl made a tour through the Province of East Bengal; he was influenced by some. of the arguments addressed to him during his tour, and he indicated an intention of taking into consideration a revised and much enlarged Partition. That was in February, 1904. But, so far as I can see, from that date until the revised Partition was completed and sanctioned by the Secretary of State in August, 1905, no statement of the enlarged programme and no statement of revised policy was ever issued by the Government of India or made public in Bengal. If I am correct in that statement, and I have endeavoured to inform myself, it is not against the existing Government of India that any charge of secrecy can lie. If a charge of secrecy is to be made at all, it should be made in reference to the circumstances to which I have now referred.<lb/>
I pass on, my Lords, to the question of the Partition of Bengal. The noble Earl's reasons for the partition of Bengal, as stated by him, were, first, the relief of Bengal from an overwhelming burden of work, a burden more than any individual could bear; and, secondly, the enlargement of the Chief Commissionership of Assam, the better recruitment of its Civil
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0129"/>
<col>207</col>
Service, and the improvement of its commercial and industrial conditions. The relief of Bengal was a long-standing question of administrative reform, as the noble Earl has stated. It is obvious to everyone that it was impossible for any single individual to deal with the official work arising in a country of 190,000 square miles and over 78,000,000 of people. Relief was necessary, and I think it is to the honour of the noble Earl that he, first of any Governor-General of India, did take up in a practical and thorough-going spirit this question of administrative relief to Bengal. But, if he will pardon my frank language, I would say that he went the wrong way to work. He began with Assam. Now, my Lords, 1 would ask the question, What is Assam? I have listened to this debate and have heard statements made regarding this Province and regarding that, but I have heard no attempt made to come to the concrete facts and to see whether the facts of each Province did really call for the great administrative changes which the noble Earl carried through in 1905.<lb/>
My Lords, what is Assam? Assam is that territory of about 56,000 square miles in extent, with a population of about six millions, which lies in the extreme northeastern corner of India between Thibet on the north, China on the east, Burma on the south, and Bengal on the west. Until 1874 that Province formed part of Bengal. In that year it was created into an independent Chief Commissionership, partly because of the tea industry which had arisen there, and partly with the object of giving some relief to the Bengal Government. That Province consists of 28,000 square miles of forests and hills inhabited by less than 1,000,000 people, many of whom within my own memory were headhunting savages. The rest of Assam consists of two river valleys, the Surmah Valley and the Brahmaputra Valley. The Brahmaputra Valley is to a large extent a malaria-stricken region affected by a peculiar kind of fever which has up to the present baffled the efforts of medical science to control it. The population of the Brahmaputra. Valley to the extent of nearly one-half is composed of aborigines, the pariahs of exclusive Hinduism, scarcely more civilised than the inhabitants of the hills whom I have just described. One district, Sylhet, really a Bengali district, contains over two millions of people, the only homogeneous part of the population.<lb/>
<col>208</col>
I That is the country&#x2014;primeval forests, sparsely-inhabited hills, malaria-stricken river regions where British industry has not introduced sanitary arrangements on the tea plantations&#x2014;that is the country for whose improvement, administrative, industrial, and commercial, the noble Earl proposed the dismemberment of Bengal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00405"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: With all respect to my noble friend that was not the genesis of the movement. I was only too glad to give relief to Assam and ally it to a higher form of administration, but nobody knows better than the noble Lord that we started, not from Assam, but from Bengal itself, and that my main object, as I stated yesterday, was the relief of the palpable and admitted misgovernment of Bengal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00406"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member><membercontribution>: I am coming to that point, but I think I am justified in saying that the enlargement of Assam by the transfer of districts from Bengal to Assam was one part of the noble Earl's policy. That is clear, and I venture to say that where you have such a Province as that, so circumstanced as regards population and as regards territory, the proper policy for the Government of India to adopt was to treat it as what it is&#x2014;a non-regulation Province; to separate it off from the other portions of the country which require more complex law and more detailed administration; to concentrate your efforts upon it alone in the well-known manner adopted in similar backward parts of India, and not add on to it settled Bengal districts which must necessarily deteriorate by their amalgamation with Assam, nor add Assam on to the settled districts, whereby it would inevitably come to be regarded as an outlying portion of the larger Province and suffer the neglect which outlying regions usually do. My point is that the noble Earl's policy with regard to Assam was not such a policy as was called for by the conditions of Assam. The question of Assam as a frontier Province calls for particular consideration having regard to the progress of China towards our frontiers. We have learnt quite recently that the Chinese are already advancing towards that portion of our Indian Empire. They have, I believe, occupied the Chumbi Valley quite close to our Darjeeling district, and we know that they have established a military post at Rima, some three days' march from the
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0130"/>
<col>209</col>
frontier near Sadya. If Assam is dealt with as a frontier Province the question of recruitment would naturally solve itself. You would not recruit for it from the Indian Civil Service, at all events not wholly; you would naturally look for young military officers willing to take service in such a place&#x2014;men of the stamp of those who have pioneered our way in other parts of India.<lb/>
My Lords, I now come to the other part of the scheme connected with Bengal. The noble Earl said yesterday, or at least I understood him to say, that his policy in regard to Eastern Bengal was determined by two considerations&#x2014;the consideration of giving to the Mahomedans a unity which they had not had since Mahomedan rule, and naturally and consequently predominance in that part of the country; and, next, the consideration that it was necessary, to remove the scandal of ineffective administration of Eastern Bengal. I hope I do not mistake the two points of the noble Earl's policy. The Partition of Bengal as carried out by the noble Earl conferred political predominance on the Mahomedans in Eastern Bengal. That, my Lords, was the first time in the history of Anglo-Indian Civil administration, so far as I know, in which&#x2014;I trust the noble Earl will pardon the word; I use it in no offensive sense&#x2014;partisanship has been manifested by the Government of India in dealing with our subject races. My Lords, the manifestation of that spirit by the Government of India is, in my opinion, very dangerous. Antagonism between Mahomedans and Hindus is one of the most fundamental and serious difficulties we have to contend with in India, and the creation of a Province with the special object of giving therein predominance to the Mahomedans in a country which was essentially a Hindu country, in which the great landholders are nearly all Hindus, was calculated to produce throughout the whole of Eastern Bengal that particular difficulty which Indian Governments are most desirous to avoid. In view of these considerations I am not surprised that now the Government of India, in their Despatch of August, speak of "the growing estrangement, which has now, unfortunately, assumed a very serious character in many parts of the country, between Mahomedans and Hindus."<lb/>
Nobody admires the true Indian Mahomedan more than I do. Those
<col>210</col>
Mahomedans who came from Central Asia and established themselves in Upper India have left behind them memorials which the modern world regard with wonder and admiration. Among the men of that race are to be found the most loyal subjects and the staunchest supporters of our rule in India. For the last six years of my official life I lived among them and was on friendly terms with nearly all of them of any importance in my Province. They are men with whom the European may be on terms of social intercourse, whom you may invite to your table and from whom you may accept invitations to theirs. To this day I am in friendly correspondence with many Mahomedan gentlemen of that class. But who are the Mahomedans of Eastern Bengal? Are they the descendants of the invaders who came into Upper India under a Mahmud, a Zenghis or Timour? By no means. They are the aboriginal inhabitants of Eastern Bengal who, after the Mahomedan invasion in the thirteenth century, willingly accepted the Mahomedan creed which, proclaiming the Unity of God and the equality of man, had peculiar attractions to people outside the pale of Hinduism. From that time up to our conquest of Bengal these men lived among their Hindu neighbours, undistinguishable from them so far as historical records show. At all events, when we took possession of Bengal towards the end of the eighteenth century we found them but little distinguished from their Bengali neighbours except for formal profession of creed. Then came that wave of Wahabi puritanism from Arabia, which in time was spread in Eastern Bengal by emissaries preaching that India was the country of the Infidel and not of the true believer and that the Holy War was obligatory. The loyalty of the Mahomedans of Eastern Bengal was undermined, and in time it became a prolific recruiting ground for the rebel colonies of Mulka and Sitana which were established on the North-Western frontier. It took three campaigns to reduce them, as the noble and gallant Field-Marshal on the Cross Benches can tell you. Those campaigns were followed by long drawn-out prosecutions, which I myself remember, in the seventies of the last century.<lb/>
My Lords, I lived among the Mahomedans of Eastern Bengal for three years and got to like them, for although they are fanatical they are a fine body of men, a hardworking, independent race, but among the
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0131"/>
<col>211</col>
most ignorant people of this class I met with in the whole of my Indian career. I agree with the noble Earl that education has not been extended among these people as much as it ought to have been. After the prosecutions to which I have referred, that great man Sir Syud Ahmad Khan, of Aligarh, devoted himself to promoting Mahomedan education, and the college at Aligarh has been the result. It will, I am glad to say, soon be expanded into a Mahomedan University, from which there is a great hope for Mahomedan progress. But it will not operate on the Feraizis of East Bengal. Yet these are the men who were given political predominance over the clever and intellectual Hindus by the Partition. 1 think that such a policy if it had not been reversed was destined to be productive of the most injurious consequences to our rule in India.<lb/>
The noble Earl says that the second reason why he introduced this policy was that the administration in Eastern Bengal was a scandal. I take it. from the noble Earl that the standard of administration in many of these Eastern Bengal districts had fallen below the normal standard of districts nearer the seat of Government, but, with all deference to the noble Earl, the cause of this falling off did not, in my opinion, lie in the direction that he supposed. The true explanation involves&#x2014;I desire to speak with carefulness upon this point&#x2014;considerations of the gravest import to our Indian Governments, because upon it hinges the relative efficiency of European and native administrative agencies. I have examined the Civil List of the Bengal services for the first quarter of 1904&#x2014;the time at which the noble Earl made his tour in the Eastern districts; and I find that the following state of things then existed in connection with the administrative staff. Excluding from consideration the three divisional headquarters of Chittagong, Dacca, and Rajshahye, and also the district of Darjeeling, which, as the noble Earl knows, always have a strong European Staff, the remaining eleven Bengali districts forming the Province of Eastern Bengal and Assam showed the following conditions in January, 1904. In two districts the administrative and Judicial staff was exclusively native; in two other districts the district magistrate was a native; in another district the district and sessions judge and the assistant magistrate were natives; another district
<col>212</col>
had a native district superintendent of police. Finally, in two other districts the European staff was abnormally weak and was supplemented by subordinate native officers. Thus, in eight of these eleven districts of East Bengal the European element in the administration was either altogether wanting or below the normal level.<lb/>
Now I do not find&#x2014;and I have examined into the point&#x2014;that these conditions prevailed to nearly the same extent in West Bengal, while in Behar they are non-existent. My Lords, Indian experience has almost invariably shown that, with European controlling agencies, a firmer grip is kept on the administration, and there is more executive virility than when the controlling agency is native. Crime is held in greater check, greater energy is infused into the executive departments, and greater attention is paid to the instructions which the Indian Government has prescribed for the maintenance of a high standard of efficiency. I would therefore submit that the deterioration from the standard which the noble Earl had observed in Eastern Bengal in 1904, and on which he based one of his arguments for the establishment of a Local Government, were due to circumstances inherent, in the conditions of the case, which the creation of a Local Government at Dacca could not remove. The tendency of our administration in India lies in the direction of a larger employment of native agency in these administrative posts, and this is as it should be. But the country must, make up its mind that the standard of efficiency hitherto demanded by Indian Governments cannot be maintained under native officers until the native officer learns from his British comrade the secret of British administrative success. Personally I am not prepared to deny that a lowering of the standard may not be unacceptable to native public opinion. In some matters I think it would be acceptable. In our administration of India we have aimed at the highest standard of efficiency, and it is difficult to know what aim one could have unless the highest. But, however that may be, I think the circumstances which I have now related to your Lordships will satisfy you that neither on the ground of giving predominance to the Mahomedans of East Bengal nor on the ground that a deterioration had taken place in East Bengal from the administrative standard
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0132"/>
<col>213</col>
of the Province as a whole was there any justification for the kind of Partition which the noble Earl carried through.<lb/>
In the Government of India's Despatch of the 25th of August last we are told that the noble Earl's Partition was working out to the loss by the Hindus in East Bengal of their previous political <i>status</i> owing to the predominance of the Mahomedan element in the councils, and that a similar loss was impending in West Bengal owing to the majority in the councils secured by the Provinces of Behar and Orissa. The ultimate effect of the noble Earl's policy, then, would be the destruction of the Bengal Hindus as a political unit in the Indian Empire. There is reason to believe that the Bengal mind was growing to regard that possible consummation as a fact certain to occur, and the conviction thereby produced was exciting among them the bitterest feelings of animosity and revenge, and these feelings found expression in the outrages and assassinations which have taken place. It is my firm belief that that state of things would have increased and grown worse as the effects of the policy of Partition became more fully realised; and therefore, in my opinion, no more happy event has ever occurred in our Indian history than His gracious Majesty's declaration in Durbar, by which the current of thought of an entire people has been changed from discontent to loyalty.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, I pass on to the third part of the noble Earl's speech&#x2014;his condemnation of the Partition as effected. So far as regards Assam, I need say no more. As to Bengal, I would only say that no statutory obligation need be placed upon the Governor to live part of the time at Dacca and part of the time at Calcutta. As my noble friend Lord Rear pointed out, the migration of the Governor from Bombay to Poonah and elsewhere is an annual occurrence. In the Upper Provinces I may tell you from my own experience that the migration of the Lieutenant-Governor from Allahabad to Lucknow and from Lucknow to Naini Tal are yearly occurrences. The Lieutenant-Governor of a Province may well be trusted to visit those parts of his charge which demand his attention.<lb/>
Turning now to Behar and Orissa, which the noble Earl called "a bundle of odds
<col>214</col>
and ends thrown together," I would point out to the House that from the earliest times at which this question of the relief of Bengal has been under notice the official mind has always looked to the west for relief. The need for relief first came to official knowledge during the inquiry into the catastrophe of the Orissa famine in 1865. It was taken up by Lord Lawrence, who, in addition to the creation of a Chief Commissionership of Assam, suggested as a possible further relief the creation of a Chief Commissionership of Behar and certain adjacent districts. It was pressed again by Sir George Campbell in 1874. I had long service in Behar as well as in Bengal, and it always seemed to me that it was through Behar that the problem of relief to Bengal could best be solved. The old Province Bengal, less Assam, was, roughly speaking, a square, and Behar with Chota Nagpur might be regarded, if your Lordships will picture it in your mind's eye, as a slice of that square, 450 miles long by 250 miles broad. It comprises a territory of 100,000 odd square miles and a population of 31,000,000. That is much larger than the Central Provinces, much larger than the Punjab. If a Province of that sort had been created it would have ranked among the great Provinces of India. It would have a perfect frontier on its east&#x2014;a frontier distinguished by geographical, by ethnical, and by linguistic attributes. It would have a race of people entirely different from the Bengalis and speaking an entirely different language. There would have been no difficulty about recruitment, as the noble Earl seemed to think in his references to a similar proposal which was put before him, because it would be larger and much more populous than the Central Provinces, which has its independent recruitment. The relief afforded to Bengal would have been most ample, because the population under the Government of Bengal would have been reduced from 78,000,000 to something under 48,000,000. No feeling of sentiment would have been outraged. The thing would have passed through without the least difficulty. But this, the obvious plan of meeting the situation, was not adopted. The noble Earl had fixed upon a policy depending on the alteration of the Assam boundary and on the division of the Bengali-speaking people involving Mahomedan predominance. Neither policy, taken individually, ought I think to commend itself to your
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0133"/>
<col>215</col>
Lordships' approval; but both policies taken together were, in my humble judgment, pernicious.<lb/>
In the Partition which has now been made the only difference from the plan I have just described is that Orissa has been tacked on to Behar and Chota Nagpur. This is a good arrangement. It is a mistake to fancy that greater similarity exists between Orissa and Bengal than between Orissa and Behar. I have been in communication with the greatest. linguistic and ethnological authority of India, Dr. Grier-son, and he tells me that the language of Orissa is more like the language of Behar than of Bengal, so there would be less difficulty in transferring officers from Behar to Orissa than from Bengal. The arrangement that has now been made is, in the circumstances, the best that could be made. The only regret I have, and it is an inevitable one, is that the Lieutenant-Governor of Behar and Orissa should be given a Council. I know no part of India in which a Council would be more out of place than in such a Province as that. What is a Council to do with the uncivilised tribes of Chota Nagpur? You want personal government there, as you want it in Assam. However, part of Bengal had a Council under previous arrangements, and the Council must now remain.<lb/>
My Lords, I now come to the last part of my remarks&#x2014;namely, as to the transfer of the capital. If I were disposed to look for reasons in favour of the transfer of the capital, not to official sources but to the speeches of public men, I should find one in the speech of the noble Earl, Lord Minto. He tells you that Bengal is seamed with subterranean intrigues. He finds Bengali politicians are corresponding with politicians in England. Political life and spirit is in great activity in Bengal, and it is to be expected that if the Government of India were located in Calcutta this political activity would operate upon it and embroil it in Bengal politics. If we can accept that description and there was no other reason for the removal of the capital from Calcutta, I should find an adequate reason in that. But the discussions between the members of the Government of India in Lord Lawrence's time give you ampler reasons for the policy now adopted. Lord Lawrence, as everybody knows, objected to removing the Government of India from Calcutta.<lb/>
<col>216</col>
He had an equal objection to creating a Governor in Council for Bengal, and his Minute of January, 1868, was directed to showing the difficulties the Government of India experience in Calcutta if a Governor in Council were created for Bengal. With my own experience of Bengal I think that Lord Lawrence's arguments on this point are conclusive. He refers to particular instances in which the presence of the Government of India in Bengal with a Governor in Council would be productive of friction. He says that "in ordinary times it would cause friction, and in times of difficulty it would produce grave inconvenience. If any difference of opinion arose between the Government of India and the Government of Bengal, both being in the same place, what would become of the former if the latter were in direct official correspondence with the Home Government? Not to go too far back, what would have been the effect as regards the Government of India if, during the disturbances of 1861 or of 1865 and 1866, the Bengal Government had been in direct communication with the Secretary of State." These, my Lords, are references to old-world incidents in the political history of Bengal, of which the noble and gallant Field-Marshal will probably have some recollection as I have, and if he speaks to-night he will be able to inform your Lordships whether he agrees with Lord Lawrence or not.<lb/>
There is one way of looking at the removal to Delhi which has not yet been noticed either in this House or in the Press. I am informed by a member of your Lordships' House who is listening to me that he has heard from an officer of high position in India that the removal to Delhi has been widely taken by the native public as a wiping out of the evil memories of the Indian Mutiny and the establishment of the British Raj upon a fresher basis. That indicates the trend of native thought, and is of importance. As to the loss of touch with non-official opinion in Calcutta, I ask your Lordships to consider what is the non-official opinion you have in Calcutta. You have European and you have native opinion. Will you lose anything by being relieved of touch with that native opinion which has been described to you by the noble Earl, Lord Minto&#x2014;that element which he regarded with suspicion as apt to enter into those proceedings and correspondence of which he did not always approve? But apart
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0134"/>
<col>217</col>
from such considerations, nothing but good will, in my opinion, come from the removal of the Government of India from subjection to the local opinion of Calcutta. Of Calcutta Sir Henry Mayne said forty years ago&#x2014;
<quote>"That place cannot be the best capital for the Empire to which the vast majority of the people governed from it refuse to come."</quote>
It is well known that no native of Upper India will come to Calcutta unless under the stress of necessity, and he gets away from Calcutta as soon as he can. In Calcutta you lose all native opinion except that of Bengal. By leaving it, you will bring yourself into touch with the thought of the more virile native society in India, and you will get out of the enervating influences of the coast fringe. As for European thought, you have in Calcutta no leisured class, no people, as you have in this country, who make politics the business of their life without having an axe to grind. The European merchants and professional men of Calcutta are engaged in making money, and they regard the questions, when they pay any attention to them, that come up before the Government of India from the standpoint of private interest or the interests of their class. I do not blame them for that. I suppose that in every country in the world the primary factor in the consideration of public questions by commercial or professional men is how will they affect themselves or their class. The Government of India will lose nothing by leaving Calcutta either from the point of view of the native or European society, for they will at Simla and Delhi and during the Viceroy's yearly visits to Calcutta have sufficient opportunity of hearing its views without being oppressed by them.<lb/>
As for the danger of emergencies to which the noble Earl referred, the difficulties of preservation of documents and so on, it is well known to the noble Earl that the Government of India nowadays has all its proceedings printed; duplicates are to be had in any number; and, further, there is no reason why all the valuable and more important documents should not be retained in Calcutta as they are now, and sent, as they are now sent to Simla, to Delhi whenever they are wanted. The Viceroy will go to Delhi and probably will not stay there more than four months in the year. He will travel about for some time; he will pay his yearly visit to
<col>218</col>
Calcutta, and will only take the touring staff and the documents connected with current work. I see no difficulty whatever.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00408"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD</member><membercontribution>: As I understand, the Government of India consists of the Viceroy anti his Council. The Viceroy, as a matter of course, will have to pay his visits to other parts of India, and he will decide what his movements should be. He will be able to stay at Delhi far longer than at Calcutta. He now stays at Calcutta for three months of the year, but at Delhi he will certainly be able to stay for four months if not longer. I think it will work out that the Government in its corporate capacity will stay there for about five months. I think it will also come to pass that the native Princes of India will have their houses in Delhi; they could not live in Calcutta&#x2014;they will come and pay their respects to the Viceroy at Delhi, and he will be able to consult them whenever any question for consultation arises, so that the necessity for the extended tour of the Viceroy will no longer exist to the same extent. I understand that the proposed arrangement is that the Viceroy will always pay a visit of at least a month to Calcutta, and that he will be able to live at Delhi, unless some particular reason takes him elsewhere, for four months of the year. That will be a great advantage to the Viceroy and the Government of India as bringing them more into touch with native thought.<lb/>
I have to apologise to your Lordships for trespassing so long upon your time. There is only one more remark that I wish to make. In my reading of the history of India we have committed many mistakes, some great, many little. But of the great mistakes that were made, three mistakes, in my opinion, stand prominent. The first of these was the mistake made by Lord Cornwallis when he made permanent the settlement of the land revenue in Bengal. I do not say it had no counterbalancing advantages, but by the permanent settlement Lord Cornwallis inflicted an injury upon the cultivators of the soil which has only of recent years been corrected. He
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0135"/>
<col>219</col>
deprived the Government of India of a great source of revenue, and thereby imposed upon them the necessity of taxation; and, worst of all, he kept the Government out of touch with the people. The next great mistake, in my reading of history, was Lord Dalhousie's cancelment of the native Chiefs' and Princes' right of adoption on failure of heirs. In that mistake Lord Dalhousie sowed the wind, or helped to sow it, and the Empire reaped the whirlwind in the Mutiny. The last mistake&#x2014;and I say it with deep regret&#x2014;is the mistake of the noble Earl, which would have had immeasurably worse consequences than either of those other two had it not been corrected in time. The noble Earl has spoken of broken promises. A promise was given in the Proclamation by which Queen Victoria took over the direct Government of India by the Crown. Her words were&#x2014;
<quote>"In their prosperity will be our strength, in their contentment our security, and in their gratitude our best reward."</quote>
My Lords, the people of Bengal, 50,000,000 nearly, regarded the noble Earl's partition as a breach of that promise. Happy Bengal, fortunate England, now that the breach has been restored from the Throne!</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00409"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am afraid your Lordships must be getting weary of this debate, but I trust that you will allow me to say a few words as I have a sense of duty in the matter. This sense of duty arises partly from the fact that. the opinions which I hold are very different from those of my noble friend who initiated the debate, and partly from the circumstance that special responsibility has been on a former occasion attributed to me in the matter which is being discussed. I regret profoundly that this debate has taken place. I was deeply impressed by what was said by the noble Marquess who leads this side of the House on December 12 last, when the King's Proclamation was first announced. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"Nothing which this House may say or do can alter what has been announced by His Majesty the King this morning. The word of the King-Emperor has been passed, and that word is irrevocable."</quote>
It seems to me that if we acted in the spirit of those words we ought to refrain from criticism until time and circumstances bring about a situation in which we might have a responsibility which is not ours at the present time. That that is the view
<col>220</col>
of the House as a whole there can be no manner of doubt seeing how very few members felt it their duty to attend the debate yesterday and how still fewer felt it incumbent upon them to sit through the two important speeches which were made.<lb/>
What, then, is the object of this discussion? What useful purpose can it serve? Is it to blame Ministers for their part in the matter? I am all for blaming Ministers when the blame is deserved and when that blame can be made effective. But I conceive that that is not so in this case. Nothing, as the noble 'Marquess told us, that we can say or do can alter what was announced by His Majesty at Delhi. And do we wish to alter it? Is there any one of us who wishes to alter it I venture to say there is no one present here who entertains such a wish. The people of India have assented&#x2014;I might say cheerfully assented&#x2014;to the changes which have been announced, and it is their opinion which really matters. The privileges of Parliament cannot, in my humble judgment, be weighed for one moment against the contentment of India in a case so unique, so impossible of constituting a precedent for the ordinary governance of India, as this one. But if your object is to prevent by your protests the course followed by the Government of India being established as a precedent, I fail to see how anything we may say in these present circumstances can affect the judgment, discretion, and responsibility of statesmen of future generations. I am not persuaded, for my own part., that anything unconstitutional has been done. Which of the unwritten laws of the Constitution has been violated No attempt has been made to show that any such violation has taken place. How far can the ancient laws of our Constitution be applied to India? There has been no demonstration of that part of the case. The changes are administrative changes, and nothing that has been done has in any way impaired the authority or responsibility of the Imperial Parliament.<lb/>
There are times when exceptions to any rules are justifiable, and no circumstances could possibly be more unique than those of His Majesty's visit to India. There is an old maxim, <i>Inter arma silent leges,</i> and I submit that that maxim may be applied to the victories of peace no less than to those of war, for "peace bath her victories no less renowned than those of
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0136"/>
<col>221</col>
War." Such a victory of peace was His Majesty's conquest of the hearts of the peoples of India. I confess that I admire the courage of those who made themselves responsible for this new policy, for it was a. courageous act. I believe that the people of India admire courage and particularly courage on the part of the Sovereign, to whom they attribute superhuman inspiration. In my view this scheme appeals to the imagination, and, as my noble friend behind me said, it is a great act of Imperial statesmanship. It has already been justified by success, in so far as it has been received with general acquiescence in India. Let us share in that acquiescence, and let us hope that that success may prove enduring.<lb/>
The noble Earl who raised this debate had not one single good word to say for any part of the scheme, for there was no detail of it to which he did not apply that criticism for which he has so wonderful a talent. But can your Lordships really believe that the proposals made by the responsible authorities, the men on the spot in India, are quite so unsound and short sighted as the noble Earl has tried to make out? Personally, I was not shaken in my opinion by any one of his arguments. There was not one of them to which, so it seemed to me, there was not a fairly obvious reply. But I am not going to attempt any such exercise at the present moment, as your Lordships are, of course, anxious to get on to the hearing of views less insignificant than my own. I shall content myself with referring to two or three points only, and that exceedingly briefly. We are told that a dangerous precedent has been established. My own view is that the exercise of the King's authority, with results which so far as any one can judge at the present time are most felicitous and satisfactory, is a most fortunate precedent, and one which we can most safely leave to the discretion of the statesmen of future generations. My noble friend poured ridicule from every point of view on the idea of Delhi as the capital of India. But was it not the case&#x2014;or is it merely my imagination&#x2014;that there was a time when the noble Earl himself fondly cherished that idea and did not reject it as altogether out of the question?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00411"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: Then I am mistaken.

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00413"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: All I can say is that if this is a matter which has been discussed by the late Viceroy and by former Viceroys, it cannot, at any rate, have been held at any time to be a thing that was either out of the question or unreasonable. As to the suggestion that Delhi is dangerous from a strategical point of view, I would ask, Where then is the justification for the residence of the Government of India at Simla for seven out of the twelve months of the year? If Delhi is dangerous strategically, then surely on every possible military consideration Simla must be still more so. I will not labour that point. I merely throw out the suggestion that if Delhi is a dangerous place strategically Simla must he more so, and it is legitimate to ask why that danger has not been considered.<lb/>
Then the noble Earl said that he had never heard it suggested that it was a disadvantage to the Government of Bengal to be overshadowed, as the expression goes, by the Government of India. Although I cannot say that I was long on the spot, my experience is altogether different, for even in remote Madras it was a commonplace of conversation that the Government of Bengal was so overshadowed; and I know that there were many people in Bengal, judging by what I constantly read in the Press and heard from other sources, who did wish for the comparative independence of Presidency Government. I disagree entirely with the views expressed by the late Viceroy (Lord Minto) on the comparative advantages and disadvantages of Presidency Government and Government by a Lieutenant-Governor, but I am not going to take up your Lordships' time with that:, as it does not seem to me to be relevant. But the noble Earl, Lord Curzon, said that the "weight of authority" was always against such a form
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0137"/>
<col>223</col>
of Government&#x2014;that is to say, Presidency Government&#x2014;for Bengal. But what about the "weight of public opinion"? He did not say anything about that, but my own view is that there was always a considerable body of public opinion in favour of such a change. The noble Earl went on to say that if it were a valid argument that the Government of Bengal was overshadowed in Calcutta by the Government of India, it would apply also to Simla, and he said that that had not even been suggested. But it does apply to Simla. So much so that during the very time the noble Earl was Viceroy a scheme was being discussed for the purposes of withdrawing the Government of the Punjab from Simla, because, I understood, the Government of the Punjab was so overshadowed by the Government of India.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00414"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: No.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00415"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: Then as regards the new form of partition, I cannot admit that there has been any betrayal of Mahomedan interests. The present arrangement seems to me fair, as there will be no decisive preponderance of numbers, either of Hindus or of Mahomedans. They will compete so far as there is competition on equal terms&#x2014;that is to say, as regards numbers &#x2014;in a sphere which will not only be wider but will also afford larger opportunities to the Mahomedans than the present arrangement.<lb/>
Whatever be the real feelings of my noble friend&#x2014;and I know that in everything he is actuated by noble conceptions of duty and by lofty motives&#x2014;I am afraid that a great many people will attribute his action to a sense of personal grievance. He regards these changes as a reversal of his policy. In fact, he said so last night. The noble Marquess who leads this side of the House unfortunately gave colour to that idea, which was then disseminated far and wide. The noble Marquess, speaking in this House on December 12 last, said&#x2014;
<quote>"These proposals involve an abrupt reversal of the policy initiated by my noble friend behind me."</quote>
The noble Marquess must have forgotten what took place in this House on June 30, 1908, when the noble Earl informed an astonished audience that I was the real culprit in the matter of the Partition of Bengal. Speaking of the Partition of
<col>224</col>
Bengal, and more particularly of the advantage it would be to Mahomedans, the noble Earl used these words&#x2014;
<quote>"But the credit for that, if credit it be"&#x2014;</quote>
Your Lordships will note that qualification&#x2014;
<quote>"was not mine. The ultimate form which the Partition took, and which differed very materially from the proposals I put forward in the first place, was conceived when the Government of India was in the hands of my noble friend Lord Ampthill."</quote>
A few days later, writing to <i>The Times</i> newspaper on the subject of that debate, Lord Curzon said that he had nothing to withdraw or qualify in what he had said on the subject. To the best of my belief he has never retracted those words, and he might therefore have left to me the blame for a defective policy which has needed a complete reversal as he regards it. I repeat what I said on a former occasion, that not the smallest share of credit is due to me for a policy which was described by Mr. Lovat Fraser, the great apologist of my noble friend, in his valuable and interesting book, as the "greatest and most beneficent of Lord Curzon's labours in India."<lb/>
But if it were otherwise I can say, quite sincerely, that I should not feel aggrieved by the present changes, or regard them in any sense as a reversal of the former policy. They seem to me to be modifications of that policy which are not unnatural after some years of experience of a great administrative change, especially when new and unexpected circumstances which no human being could have foreseen have recently arisen. There has been no return whatever to the old state of things. Bengal is still partitioned, though partitioned in a different way, and it is partitioned for precisely the same reasons and with the same objects as those which actuated my noble friend when he made himself responsible for that policy. But, my Lords, since nothing that we can say or do can alter that which has been done, let us not set an example of discontent. There is no evidence and o no reason to believe that the people of India are discontented in this matter. On the contrary, so far as my information goes, there are many signs that the reverse is the case, and the contentment of India should, in my humble opinion, be sufficient to justify our contentment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00416"><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT MORLEY)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord who has just sat down has truly said that the discussion opened last night by the noble Earl opposite will be ineffectual, as the Motion of the noble Earl can produce no result in the way of a change of policy. But the Government, while not urging discussion, have never been in a position to deprecate it. It is impossible that they should, and they do not deny for a moment that the matters involved in the new policy are fairly topics for Parliamentary debate, and the taking, if necessary, of Parliamentary opinion. I confess, with all admiration for the noble Earl's great gifts and for his sure knowledge of the topics which he handles, that I do think the tone of his speech last night was not all that could have been desired from a man of his authority and antecedents in Indian policy and history. For example, I think we were all rather surprised, and I think somewhat shocked, that he should have thought it worth while to bring up that story about the Indian who had been invested with a ribbon, and made an offensive remark about it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00417"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: Not offensive.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00418"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: It is satisfactory to us to be able to say that that story is completely unfounded. Trouble has been taken to ascertain about it, and I can assure the noble Earl that he has been misinformed. The story is untrue, and even if it had been true I cannot but think that it is a kind of thing that, on reflection, the noble Earl will consider had better have been omitted. The debate this afternoon has in no way helped the object of the noble Earl. We have had speaker after speaker, four of them, all adverse to his views and propositions. The speeches of Lord Mac Donnell, a man of special competence on this subject, of Lord Harris, Lord Reay, and now Lord Ampthill, all deprecated the line taken by the noble Earl, and all approved, almost without reservation, of the new policy.<lb/>
There was one exception which was particularly disagreeable to me, the speech of Lord Minto. It was particularly disagreeable to me because for five years he and I were good comrades in a rather stormy
<col>226</col>
voyage. He was good enough to say something about me, and I can cordially say the same of him. He dwells upon the point of what he calls secrecy. He thinks there ought to have been a much more ample discussion before those resolutions were finally adopted. Now what does he exactly mean? He says "Oh, there were Indian authorities in England who ought to have been consulted there were Lieutenant-Governors in India who ought to have been consulted," and so on. My noble friend and I have often groaned under the tendency of the officials of the Indian Government to multiply what are called files, and, as Lord Mac Donnell showed, to go back into history. What would have been gained by asking their opinion upon a point which depended, not upon old history, not upon old arguments threshed out, but upon the present actual situation? I was often reproached when I had the honour of being Secretary of State for not paying deference enough to the man on the spot. The noble Earl did not say that and would not say it, but it was said. But how does my noble friend suppose that any of the noble Lords who have been Viceroys of India or Governors of presidencies could have given point to questions like the transfer of the capital from Calcutta to Delhi, which has been before the people of India, officials and others, for generation after generation? As for consulting Lieutenant-Governors, I do not wish to say anything disrespectful of them, but looking back upon my co-operation with my noble friend I am not sure that I can recall any particular reverence that was paid to them by my noble friend or myself. Therefore I think that is rather a factitious point. Then my noble friend expressed a very adverse opinion indeed to Presidency Government, and he made a point that Bengal is the worst place in which to have a government of that kind, and he implied among other reasons because there were communications between Bengal and people in England. My noble friend and I used to differ sometimes. He attached a good deal more importance to `the communications with gentlemen in the House of Commons and newspaper editors and so on than I ever did; and I suffered from them mach more than my noble friend did, because the result of those communications was a shower of questions to me in the House of Commons day after day. But let me put this point to him. I am sure he will recognise the aptness of it. Will

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00420"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: My noble friend speaks not without authority and knowledge, and he says he thinks so. I wonder now whether there is much of a margin in favour of Bombay as compared with Bengal. I should have thought not; but as my noble friend differs, so be it. As for partition, though we began to consider that point, there was never between my noble friend and myself, so far as I recollect, one single atom of dissention, and everything I said in this House and elsewhere was exactly what my noble friend would have liked me to say. On that point the noble Earl referred last night, perfectly good naturedly, to the line taken by himself and by the Government represented in this House by myself at that time upon partition. I used to be questioned and blamed very much by persons who sympathised with Lord Mac Donnell, for example, for not reversing the partition right away. I said, as the noble Earl stated last night, that I did not like the method in which partition was carried. But there were other reasons. What were they?<lb/>
My noble friend was made Viceroy in November, I became Secretary of State in December. We were therefore a new Government. I am sure the noble Earl would be the first person to admit that. a great Party sweep having taken place in Great Britain and a Government of a different tone and complexion having come into power, it was all-important that nothing should be done to lead people in India to suppose for a moment that there was going to be any great sweep or reversal of policy. There was another reason or argument which I am sure actuated both of us&#x2014;namely, that it would be wrong, partition having only been in operation for six months or less&#x2014;wrong and rash for us at once to reverse an operation the effects of which we had had no opportunity of forming a judgment upon. There was a third reason. My noble friend and I were engaged upon a project of Council reform. That was a project which was regarded by
<col>228</col>
a great many people as dangerous, as hazardous in the extreme, as opening the door to all kinds of mischief, and let me say that the Bill which I had the honour of introducing and carrying through the House was most thoroughly considered and fairly treated by the noble Marquess and by the noble Earl. That was a tremendous reform upon which we were engaged. It was a reform for the successful carrying out of which we were bound to have with us as far as ever we could the good opinion and the friendly aid of the Indian Civil Service and of Anglo-Indian public opinion. if they had seen that we were going to reverse Lord Curzon's policy, that we were then going to launch out on this difficult and arduous voyage, we should have run the risk of having our whole course and prospects seriously damaged. That is the whole story. I commend it to friends of mine, outside as well as here, who were very angry for many months with me especially for not taking immediate steps for reversing that policy. That, if you like, would have been a concession to clamour, if we had reversed partition in December, 1906. There was a well-known Member of Parliament who wrote a letter and said that if they would be tenacious in keeping up the clamour they would squeeze me into advising my noble friend opposite to give way. That is the story of the failure to reverse, and if there is any charge of inconsistency in abstaining from reversing partition in 1906, 1907, and onwards, and now accepting the policy, which is not a reversal but a modification of the policy of partition, my withers are at all events completely unwrung.<lb/>
The noble Lord who has just spoken reminded your Lordships of a debate that took place on June 30, 1908. I am not going over that ground again, but I must say to the noble Earl that his accounts of his attitude and his motives in regard to partition are a little difficult to follow. In 1908 he gave the whole credit to Lord Ampthill. Last night he said that it was not the Viceroy at all who drew the partition line, that the particular line to be drawn was a matter, not for the Viceroy, but a matter to be settled by consultation and discussion between the local Governors and officials of the representative bodies, and so on, and that they agreed upon a line based upon ethnical and geographical considerations, the importance of which would not be denied.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00421"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: I have been challenged on both sides, and perhaps the noble Viscount will not think it rude of me if I state in a sentence or two what are the facts of the matter. They arose in this way. In December, 1903, the first schemes of partition were put forward. They were published in papers in India and in a Blue-book in Parliament. The line first put forward on the advice of our officials was, I believe, a bad one. I went to Dacca and other places in Eastern Bengal and soon realised that the public was adverse to our proposals but that larger schemes would be favoured, and I indicated that such schemes would be considered. They were considered, and we sent the matter again to our local bodies and officials and to public bodies and asked their opinions with regard to it. The answers to the letters we wrote had not come in before I left India in April, 1904, for a six months' holiday. The noble Lord (Lord Ampthill) then took my place at Simla, and the answers came in while I was away. The whole matter was most carefully examined and discussed by the noble Lord and his councillors in my absence, and the line ultimately adopted was recommended by these various officials to whom I have referred in my absence. With perfect loyalty to me the noble Lord left the discussions on paper to be dealt with by me when I arrived at Calcutta. I took over from him in December. I read the whole of the discussions and the whole of the reports of the officials that had passed in the interim. I found that they had settled on a new line differing entirely from my original one, and even from the one proposed when I left India. I accepted the new line, and at the first meeting of the Council we agreed to send the proposals to the Secretary of State. For everything after that date I have accepted the sole responsibility.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00422"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: After what the noble Earl has said I am glad to think that we in this House&#x2014;I, at all events&#x2014;shall never again be bewildered, as we have been ever since June, 1908, down to the eve of the present statement by the noble Earl, as to the real history of this famous transaction. I hope that I, at all events, shall never have anything more to say upon it.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, I am only going to make one or two remarks more upon the
<col>230</col>
Constitutional point. I think my noble friend Lord Minto said a word upon that. What is exactly the Constitutional point? The noble Earl I do not think put exactly what his point is. Lord Salisbury, speaking I suppose in this very place, said&#x2014;
<quote>"I hold that the Monarchy should seem to be as little Constitutional as possible."</quote>
I think I understand what Lord Salisbury who was not a rash talker, meant, but it is a doubtful proposition. It is true that we are now dealing with what is undoubtedly delicate Constitutional ground. A very admirable Constitutional writer once said&#x2014;
<quote>"It would create great surprise if people were told how many things a Sovereign could do without consulting Parliament."</quote>
It is quite true that the Sovereign can exercise Executive powers to an enormous extent within specified restrictions of law.<lb/>
Let us turn to the Indian system of government. The Indian system of government is a written Constitution resting on Statutes and instruments, warrants, and the like which are as good as Statutes. The ultimate responsibility for Indian government rests beyond all question with the Imperial Government, represented by a Secretary of State, and in the last resort, therefore, through the Secretary of State by Parliament. The Cabinet of the day, through a Secretary of State, has an indefeasible right, within limits laid down by law, to dictate policy, to initiate instructions, to reject proposals, to have the last word in every question that arises and the first word in every question that in their view they think ought to arise. There cannot be any doubt in the mind of any noble Lord that that is the final doctrine. It has been accepted by everybody, and how can you suppose that we should have tendered any advice to the Sovereign which would in any way have impaired that doctrine?<lb/>
What has the Government of India to do? The Government of India and the home Government have to regard two sets of public opinion obviously&#x2014;public opinion in India and public opinion here. That is what an ingenious man meant who said that the government of India under those double responsibilities was like a man trying to keep his watch in time in two different longitudes. That is the constant difficulty. In this case we avoided that
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0141"/>
<col>231</col>
responsibility. Is it not clear&#x2014;Lord Harris mentioned it to-night, and there is evidence in abundance from India&#x2014;that we have satisfied public opinion in India, however you may define Indian public opinion, and we have satisfied opinion here. It is quite true that noble Lords may say&#x2014;I hope they will not, for many reasons&#x2014;"Wait, you do not know." But we do know that the step itself and the policy, including the making of the announcement by the King, have been received with warm approval in India both by the Anglo-Indian officials and by the Indian population, and here by organs of the Press and by both of our two great Parties. Here is the announcement of His Majesty the King which it was my duty to read to the House in December&#x2014;
<quote>"We are pleased to announce to our people that upon the advice of our Ministers tendered after consultation with our Governor-General in Council we have decided,"</quote>
and so on. There is no more pedantic worshipper of the Constitution than I am. Is not that exactly what the Constitution demands? There are other expressions in these Papers which point the same way and from which the same moral is to be drawn. I could labour that very easily, but I do not think it is at all necessary. I did not hear from the noble Earl, and I certainly have not heard it from anybody else, since the general view of the House has been entirely the other way, anything to justify the language that has been used as to the unconstitutional nature of this proceeding and the method of it.<lb/>
The noble Earl has predicted, among other things, that the finance will be nearer &#x00A3;12,000,000 than &#x00A3;4,000,000. I care as much about finance as 1 do about any Department in the Government of India. I think half of my time was spent in remonstrating about discrepancies between estimates sent from India and the actual expenditure when the bills came to be paid, and when you think of all the changes in fiscal policy that may result from overcharged or badly managed finance I regard this as the most serious element of all, and I should have been very jealous of the expenditure which might have been involved. But what my noble friend said last night ought, I think, to reassure all those who have nervous misgivings, which I confess in the early stage of these proceedings I myself had. I hope that that prediction of the noble Earl, which was quite a fair one for him to make if he had so
<col>232</col>
persuaded himself, may not come to pass, and I can only say that many predictions about India in the past have failed to come to pass. I have read a great many of them from the time of Pitt down to that of the noble Earl opposite, and it is astonishing how false predictions abound. I would also remind the noble Earl that when I brought the Indian Councils Bill before this House he and the noble Marquess, while they pressed their case with perfect fairness and Parliamentary judgment, both doubted whether those reforms would turn out so well as my noble friend and I hoped. They have turned out extremely well, and I hope that as that prediction as to the policy of 1909 has not been realised, so the misgivings which the noble Earl gave utterance to last night will also prove to be unfounded.</membercontribution></p>

I dare say it was rather a trivial one and perhaps unworthy of being mentioned here. But with regard to my authority for it, since the noble Viscount denied the story explicitly, I may say that I told the story on high authority, and not upon gossip, with permission to use it in this House and with the assurance that it was absolutely true.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00424"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Perhaps I may be allowed to say one word on the point of this rather unfortunate story. I am informed that the story as told by the noble Earl has been telegraphed to India in this form, that the personage whom he reported as having received a high decoration and as having said that it must be regarded as a rope with which to hang himself, was actually invested with the decoration and made the observation at the time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00425"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: No.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00426"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: As told by the noble Earl, the story, I suppose, was susceptible of that interpretation, although I am quite certain it was not the story the noble Earl intended to tell. I am very sorry that he thought his story worth telling at all, but told in that form it would mean that an insult of a most offensive kind was intended by this Indian gentleman with respect to an Order conferred by His Majesty; and naturally that
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0142"/>
<col>233</col>
such a story should be believed in India would be most unfortunate from every point of view, and would be a grievous injury to the very loyal gentleman who was most obviously pointed at in the anecdote told by the noble Earl. My noble friend, therefore, drew attention to the facts in order to state that the story in the form in which it has been repeated is not a true one. It can easily be shown that it is impossible that the story could be true, because the particular gentleman in question, although he was at Delhi, was ill, and was never invested with a decoration. Therefore the story must obviously be untrue. As I said yesterday, I do not know on What authority the story, if it referred to a casual remark supposed to have been made by this gentleman, was told; but I consider that it is of the first importance to contradict it absolutely, in the form in which I understand it has been conveyed to India through the public Press; and I have no doubt that the noble Earl will be grateful to me for doing so.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00427"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: I am not responsible for the form in which it was sent to India. This is really most unfair. The story is apparently sent out to India in a mutilated, erroneous, and offensive form, but I have really no responsibility for that. I told it in the innocent form in which it was told to me. I regret, of course, that I ever told it, but for the consequences I am not responsible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00428"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Your Lordships have heard speeches in the course of this debate from three exViceroys&#x2014;for I have a right to count my noble friend on the Back Bench as one&#x2014;and I confess that it is with a certain amount of reluctance that I offer a fourth contribution from a similar source. Eighteen years have passed since I left India, and I realise fully that circumstances have changed very much in that country, and that the impressions which I may have formed in those days may have become considerably out of date. There is another reason which renders me reluctant to intervene, and that is the reason which was so well expressed by my noble friend Lord Minto in the first speech which he has delivered in your Lordships' House since his return from India, a speech to which therefore we all listened with great interest and pleasure, when he expressed his earnest wish that nothing
<col>234</col>
might be said in the course of these discussions which might appear to detract from the brilliant and unbroken success of the recent visit of His Majesty to his Indian Empire. Whatever we may think about the questions which we are discussing tonight, we all feel how great a debt of gratitude we owe to His Majesty for the signal service which he has rendered to the Empire by his recent progress through India, and I therefore hope I shall say nothing which could lend itself to the interpretation of a desire to strike an inharmonious note. May however, say that this feeling of reluctance is very widely shared both here and in India, and that the noble Marquess opposite ought, perhaps, to take the existence of that feeling into account when he tells the House that public opinion is unanimous, or almost unanimous, either here or in India, in favour of the recently announced policy. It is within my knowledge, and that of many of your Lordships, that there are a number of people here and in India who have very grave doubts indeed as to the wisdom of the new policy, but who nevertheless, for the reasons which I gave a moment ago, are unwilling openly to express their misgivings or their disapprobation. For example, when we are told that the Mahomedans of Eastern Bengal are likely to acquiesce in the changes which have been made we are perfectly certain in our minds that they are profoundly chagrined by those changes, but we know also that their well-known loyalty will render them very slow to take any action or use any language which might be considered as an indication of a desire to give further trouble to the Government.<lb/>
It will scarcely be disputed by noble Lords opposite that we have an ample right to examine with freedom the new departure which is about to take place. I was glad to note that the noble Viscount who spoke just now readily admitted the existence of that right. For, my Lords, there are two propositions which I do not think any one will be courageous enough to dispute. The first is that these changes are of immense importance; and the second that they have been accomplished by methods entirely unusual. I will not labour the first point, because we have it on record in the words of the Government of India that this is one of the most weighty decisions ever taken since the establishment of British rule in India. There can be no doubt that in the history, of the
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0143"/>
<col>235</col>
country the year of the departure of the Government from Calcutta will be an imperishable landmark. Nor, my Lords, is it likely that the visit of His Majesty would have been signalised in this manner had it not been for the consciousness of his advisers that these changes were indeed of the most momentous description. As to the unusual character of the procedure followed, the noble Marquess in the course of his long speech last night did not for an instant dispute that the methods were unusual. His defence was of a different kind. He did not deny that the utmost and most unusual secrecy had been observed, but his point was that the occasion itself was so entirely exceptional that unusual methods were justifiable. That, if I may be allowed to say so, was rather a different defence from that which we heard a moment ago from the noble Viscount, because the noble Viscount gave us a disquisition on the Constitutional rights of the Sovereign, and denied altogether that there was anything unconstitutional in his action on this occasion. I do not desire to raise the high Constitutional point. I am content to argue that this thing was done on the advice of His Majesty's Ministers in a manner wholly unprecedented and in a manner which, as I shall endeavour to show presently, does not form by any means a desirable precedent with regard to the future.<lb/>
Let me say two or three words as to the merits of some of the changes which are about to be introduced, and first, one word about the Partition of Bengal. My noble friend Lord Ampthill took me to task for having spoken of this as a reversal of the policy of my noble friend behind me. I am willing to accept his correction. I think the word used by the noble Marquess opposite, who described it as the re-partition of Bengal, was perhaps the more correct expression, but I should have been equally correct if I had described it as an abrupt disturbance of the partition arrived at by my noble friend behind me. I think my noble friend behind me may well claim that, although his partition has been thus materially modified, the great principle for which he contended when he was concerned with these affairs has been respected. My noble friend's great point was that the Province of Bengal, owing to its enormous and unwieldy size, was of such an extent that good administration
<col>236</col>
was not possible within it. He addressed himself to that great problem and brought about, as we all know, the partition of the Province. Whether my noble friend's partition was indeed the only proper partition to make, whether ingenuity could have devised some partition, some territorial re-arrangement less open to objection, I have never felt competent to decide. The case clearly was one which only persons possessing expert knowledge could deal with adequately. But the fact remains that the question was dealt with, and dealt with deliberately, by those who had the expert knowledge in India; that, after all those who had a right to be consulted had been consulted; after the change had been approved by the Secretary of State in Council and by the Cabinet; after it had been discussed in Parliament; after it had been formally accepted more than once by the noble Viscount himself as a settled fact&#x2014;that settlement is to be upset entirely and a territorial re-arrangement of a wholly different character put in its place.<lb/>
The case which is made by my noble friend behind me is that whatever opposition his partition may have encountered at the first, that opposition had been overcome so that the country had entirely settled down. We had a most important contribution to our knowledge of this subject in the speech of my noble friend Lord Minto. He told us that he had become aware that the agitation was stone-dead&#x2014;I think that was the expression which he used. That is really a very remarkable and authoritative statement, derived, not, of course, from my noble friend's own personal inspection of the Province, but from the reports of his advisers, who were familiar with the circumstances and who had the right to make him aware of their views. And to my mind much the more serious factor in this controversy is that during the years when my noble friend's partition was being bitterly and, I think, unscrupulously attacked, the officials of the Government of India had been constantly intimating to those who came to them for advice that the partition was a settled thing and that there was no prospect whatever of its being disturbed or altered. Information of that kind was given to men who had stood by us when times were bad and who have leaned upon us, and to them and to the officials who held this language to them
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0144"/>
<col>237</col>
it cannot fail to have come as a most serious shock and disappointment that, all of a sudden, the arrangement of my noble friend is to be torn up by the roots. I am afraid there can be no doubt whatever that the impression left upon the minds of many of those most concerned is that, however excellent the motives may be for which this change is to be made, it does represent the triumph of a very persistent and a very dangerous agitation.<lb/>
May I pass from that for one moment to the question of Calcutta? I own that I am quite unconvinced by any of the arguments which I have heard as to the alleged unfitness of Calcutta to be the capital of the Empire. During the time which I spent in India, although I often heard murmurings as to what used to be called "the Simla exodus," I never heard murmurings at the residence of the Government of India in the city of Calcutta. Calcutta seems to me to possess all the attributes calculated to make the city a worthy capital. It has a very large population. It is a great emporium of trade. It has a large, varied, and representative community, native and European. The commercial element is strongly represented. You have the legal element, due to the presence of the High Court of Calcutta, and you have the official element, due to the presence, not only of the Government of India, but also of the Government of Bengal. I am somewhat distracted by the different arguments which have been used in reference to the alleged dangers supposed to be caused by the presence of the two Governments&#x2014;the Bengal Government and the Imperial Government&#x2014;in the city of Calcutta. The noble Marquess's apprehension was that in times of trouble friction might arise between the two Governments with obviously inconvenient results.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00429"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I did not say that friction might arise between the two Governments. What if said was that in times of trouble, and in dealing with matters connected with crime, the divided responsibility of the two Governments gave rise, and had actually given rise&#x2014;I was not merely expressing a fear of what might happen&#x2014;had actually given rise to inconvenient and serious consequences.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00430"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: That at any rate is a very different ground
<col>238</col>
of objection from that alleged by my noble friend Lord Harris. His rear was that the Government of Bengal and the Government of India at Calcutta would become too intimate&#x2014;that the Government of India would be likely to overshadow, I think that was the expression he used, the Government of Bengal. And then there is the third and different reason which is alleged in the Despatch of the Government of India. In that Despatch, Lord Harding's fear is that, if Calcutta were to become a Presidency Government, there might not be room in the city for two such high officials as the Governor-General and a Governor sent out from England; that there might be, as he puts it, regrettable antagonism or rivalry between them. All these dangers seem to me to be a little farfetched. All I can say, speaking from personal experience, is that I never knew of any difficulty arising from the simultaneous presence of the two Governments. On the contrary, I think it was considerably to the advantage of the Government of India to be able to confer personally with the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal and with some of his highest officials. With regard to considerations of health, I do not think Calcutta leaves much to be desired. It has vast open spaces, its sanitary conditions have been greatly improved, it, has broad thoroughfares, and an abundant water supply. I cannot but think that it is a misfortune for the Government of India to lose its connection with Calcutta, and, to some extent, I think it is a misfortune for Calcutta to lose its connection with the Government of India, although I have no doubt that the men who have made Calcutta what it is will survive the passing disappointment occasioned by the severance of a tie which has lasted for a century and a-half.<lb/>
My noble friend dealt so fully with the conditions which are found at Delhi that I need say very little about them. I am a little sceptical as to the immense sentiment in favour of Delhi as the capital which noble Lords opposite believe exists in the public mind in India. I think it may be taken as established that the sanitary conditions of Delhi are considerably inferior to those of Calcutta. I remember hearing, when this discussion began, of an ailment known as the Delhi boil. I was at first incredulous. I thought the story was the invention of some evil-disposed person, but, rather to my surprise,
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0145"/>
<col>239</col>
two or three days ago I happened to notice in one of the newspapers a statement, apparently on high authority, that a great American investigator, Dr. Wright, has been devoting a considerable amount of attention to this mysterious complaint. It is described as an ulcer which sometimes reaches a diameter of three or tour inches, lasts for from five to ten months, and then gradually heals, fortunately leaving the Patient proof against further attacks. Let us hope that the members of the Government of India, in their first term of residence at Delhi will undergo a kind of seasoning, and escape all further tribulations from that source.<lb/>
But the great point about Delhi is that you are going to move the Government of India from a city which has a great many of the best attributes of a capital city to a city which has not now, and is not in the least likely to have those attributes as time goes by. The present city of Delhi is a comparatively small walled city. You are going to create a new capital, probably at some distance, it may be some three or four miles, from the old city of Delhi. You are going to call into existence, not a great centre of national life and activity, but what will be very little better than a cantonment grouped around the official residences, with such bazaars and things as are necessary for the supply of those residences, but without any of that representative element, that mixture of society, which is to be found at Calcutta. There is a complaint now that the Government of India is too long shut up at Simla, away from outside influences. Under this arrangement the Government would spend part of the year shut up at Simla and the other part in an equally bureaucratic and remote society at some place adjoining the city of Delhi.<lb/>
There is one argument against which my noble friend protested and in which protest I desire to join in regard to the movement to Delhi. We are told that the transfer to Delhi is to be regarded as an emphatic indication that the Government of India intend to remain in the country. I must raise my voice against that argument. Is it necessary to do anything to convince the people of India that we are going to stay in the country? If it has come to that we are in a bad pass indeed. And let me add that you will give a shock to confidence in the stability of your arrangements by upsetting the Partition of Bengal which
<col>240</col>
the transfer of the Government to Delhi will certainly not neutralise.<lb/>
I do not think any one has taken up the point which was raised by my noble friend behind me when he called attention to that very remarkable third paragraph in the Despatch of the Government of India. In that paragraph it is intimated that what the Government of India have in their mind is an ultimate arrangement under which there would be a number of autonomous Governments with a Viceroy directing the whole system from some central point, where he would be cut off equally from all those autonomous Governments. That policy may be good or bad, but it certainly is not a policy into which we ought to be rushed in the manner in which we are being rushed into these other changes. If His Majesty's Government really carry out their craze for devolution to the extent that they are meditating&#x2014;if they contemplate the introduction in India of some federal system of the kind which apparently they have in view for parts of the Empire nearer home&#x2014;they raise a vast question of policy which ought surely to be fully discussed and examined before we are committed to it.<lb/>
As to the question of cost, my noble friend was not successful in obtaining any information as to the <i>data</i> upon which the estimate of four millions was framed. The reason is not far to seek. You cannot have had a properly prepared estimate. If you had you would have been obliged to consult the different Departments, certainly your Public Works Department. You could not do so, because the seal of secrecy was set upon the whole of these proceedings. We have not been told whether the estimate includes all the consequential expenditure, nor whether it covers a sum of three-quarters of a million which has already been spent upon the creation of a new capital at Dacca. Does it include the cost of new headquarters at Patna, of hill stations, and of the barracks which will be required? We have asked for information but have failed to obtain any on this important point. I may say frankly that I have met no one who believes that the cost of all this will be kept within four millions or anything like it.<lb/>
I o do not think I am putting it too high when I say there is room for doubt as to all these questions. There
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0146"/>
<col>241</col>
may be answers to our criticisms and objections, but we have not had them. The reason we have not had them is that owing to your desire to introduce this new policy as a dramatic surprise you have precluded yourselves from seeking the kind of information and advice to which, in ordinary circumstalices, you would have been bound to resort. In. India all important proposals have to go through the official mill, which no doubt grinds rather slowly. The noble Viscount betrayed his impatience of the process in some remarks he made just now. He asked what would have been gained by consultation. He did not say as the noble Marquess his colleague said, that consultation was impossible because Otherwise the thing might mot have gone through. The noble Viscount is much more autocratic. Indeed, if you want autocratic sentiments you have only to go to a Liberal Minister. The noble Viscount avoided consultation because he did not want to be bored by the weighty files that the Indian Departments produce so freely. He has taken the short cut, and in this case it was a short cut indeed. Do not let me be understood as failing to understand the reasons for which His Majesty's advisers desired that there should be something dramatic in regard to the announcement to be made by His Majesty at the Delhi Durbar. I go further. I say the country would have allowed you without wincing to stretch a good many points in order that this desire for dramatic effect should not be disappointed. But in this case, was it really essential that you should dispense with the whole of the usual procedure and run the tremendous risks which, I believe, you are running in order that your dramatic effect should not fail of its impressiveness? I cannot help feeling considerable doubt when I am told that feeling Majesty's visit would have fallen short of the success we all desired for it if this new policy had not been announced in the manner in which it was. Lord Harris gave us an eloquent description of the way in which the great crowds rushed in to do homage to the empty Thrones on which their Majesties had been sitting. It was, no doubt, a most impressive spectacle. But, my Lords, when it is suggested that the people who did this were thinking either of the Partition of Bengal or of the change of capital I am profoundly incredulous.</membercontribution></p>

Of course, what created the enthusiasm on that and other occasions was the feeling of the people, with whom His Majesty Mind himself face to face, that their ruler was no longer "the King of some remote star," but a human ruler able to go among them and charm them by his own personality, and willing at the very outset of his reign to undertake the immense exertion and fatigues inseparable from so long and arduous a progress.<lb/>
The reply and explanation of the noble Marquess is one which fills me with considerable alarm. He asked us last night what would have happened supposing instead of taking the country by surprise we had done all this in the usual manner. He said there would have been a marked and lively agitation, that we might have been obliged to enforce the Press Act against the newspapers, and that the Mahomedans might probably have given trouble. I think it quite possible that some of these things might have happened; indeed I think it quite probable, that if the speech delivered by my noble friend Lord Curzon last night had been delivered in this House or by sortie one, else the House of Commons or on public platform while His Majesty's Government Were still Uncommitted, public Opinion would have demanded that Ministers should hold their hand before committing themselves beyond recall, as they have, to this new policy. But observe what the legitimate deduction from the noble Marquess's explanation is. It is that when a new departure in policy is likely to Meet with an inconvenient reception you may rush the public into it and dispense with all the usual and timehonoured&#x2014;I will not use the word Constitutional&#x2014;processes which have always been resorted to in India and elsewhere when some great new departure takes place. What an argument for Liberal Ministers to use! They are supposed to welcome the free breeze of public discussion. The noble Viscount himself has introduced popular representation in India. All this is to be ignored whenever it suits the convenience of His Majesty's Government to do this, and they resort to what I can only describe
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0147"/>
<col>243</col>
as something very like a <i>coup&#x010F;&#x00E9;tat,</i> because if they had not done so they might have found it difficult to get their proposals through at all.<lb/>
I have said all that I desire to say. The changes are, beyond question, most momentous. S
ome of them seem to me to be of a very doubtful character. At any rate, I venture to affirm in regard to them that they required an amount of examination which they did not receive, and that they have been accomplished under very unusual circumstances. We were bound to comment upon the action of His Majesty's Government. We should have been unworthy of our position if we had failed to do so. But, my Lords, let me end by saying that now that our protest has been made we shall say nothing and do nothing to interfere with the success of the new policy. Indeed I will go further and say that no one would be better pleased than we if the apprehensions which we have expressed should prove to be groundless; and that no one hopes more sincerely than we do that the bright page of history which His Majesty has been instrumental in inscribing upon the annals of the Empire will be followed by an unbroken record of prosperity, contentment, and good government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00433"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I, by the indulgence of the House, explain one point, not of course in answer to anything which the noble Marquess has said, because I am not entitled to do that, but with regard to a remark which fell from him and to one also which fell from the noble Earl yesterday with which I omitted to deal, for I am rather afraid that the absence of any observation from this side upon it might lead to misunderstanding in India. The point relates to the third paragraph in the Despatch of the Government of India. Unfortunately I had a great deal of ground to cover in the very long speech with which am afraid I wearied those who listened to it yesterday, and I did not reply to the noble Earl on that point. The point is this. He seemed to assume, and the noble Marquess who has just sat down also seemed to assume, that there was something approaching a settled policy on the part of the Government of India and, for all I know, of the Government at home, leading in the direction of something like a federal system in India. I wish to dispel altogether the idea that anything of the kind is intended. What my noble
<col>244</col>
friend the Viceroy in his Despatch did&#x2014;and I think if the paragraph is carefully read it will be taken as doing nothing more&#x2014;was to draw attention to the general trend and tendency of the form of Government in India, particularly as it now exists under the Councils Act of 1909 which is associated with my noble friend Lord Morley. Lord Hardinge was speaking of the general tendency which might be expected to continue towards a further decentralisation in all matters of a provincial kind, and he drew the conclusion which is to be found towards the close of the paragraph. But it would be unfortunate, and not in consonance with the facts, if a belief were held that we have or that the Government of India have any policy in view in the nature of a formal system of federation. I repeat that my noble friend Lord Hardinge was simply speaking of what he takes to be the inevitable trend and tendency of things in India.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE APPOINTMENT OF COLONIAL<lb/>
GOVERNORS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00460"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member> rose to ask the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies to explain the meaning of Colonel Seely's statement in the House of Commons of the 13th of July, and of Mr. Harcourt's statement of the 15th of November last year, that "a Governorship lies quite outside of the ordinary course of promotion in the Colonial Service"; and to move for Papers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00461">The noble Earl said: My Lords, I once had the honour of occupying the position which the noble Lord now occupies as the representative of the Colonial Office in this House. I held the office for five years and after that I had myself the honour of being a Colonial Governor, so I have had the opportunity of making a great many friends in the Colonial Service. I think I may claim to know what their thoughts are concerning that Service, and I have put on the Paper the Motion which stands in my name because I hope to elicit from the noble Lord the present Under-Secretary some explanation of the rather extraordinary statements which the representatives of the Colonial Office have made in the House of Commons on the subject of the relation of the Colonial Civil Service to the appointment of Governors. The only quotations I will trouble your Lordships with are from answers given to questions in the House of Commons. The first answer is by Colonel Seely in July last. He at that time occupied the post which the noble Lord now fills. In reply to a question, Colonel Seely said&#x2014;
<quote>"It must be understood that a Governorship lies quite outside of the ordinary course of promotion in the Colonial Service."</quote>
I suggest to your Lordships that those are very extraordinary words. Mr. Lyttelton took the first opportunity open to him&#x2014;it was not until November&#x2014;to put a question to Mr. Harcourt on the same subject. This was Mr. Harcourt's reply&#x2014;
<col>248</col>
<quote>"A Governorship lies outside the ordinary course of promotion both in the Colonial Office and in the Colonial Service. I see no reason for reconsidering or modifying the present practice, and I can assure the right hon. gentleman that the claims of the Service are fully considered whenever a Governorship becomes vacant, my only object being to get the best available man."</quote>
Mr. Lyttelton then put this supplementary question&#x2014;
<quote>"In the case of the Colonial Secretary, say, of Ceylon, would not his claim be considered paramount to that of another person outside the Service of equal ability?"</quote>
To this Mr. Harcourt replied&#x2014;
<quote>"The only claim I consider paramount would be the question of merit."</quote>
There are parts of Mr. Harcourt's answers which obviously require no explanation. But I do think that the words of Colonel Seely, which he endorsed, do require explanation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00462">It must be understood that a Governorship lies quite outside of the ordinary course of promotion in the Colonial Service Now, my Lords, what does that mean? Does it mean that in the Colonial Service, as in all other Services, there is a neck to the bottle, and that only a very small proportion of those who enter the Colonial Service can hope to become Governors? I do not think it can mean anything of that kind; that would be a mere truism. Or does it mean that the Secretary of State reserves to himself the right to recommend to the King for appointment as Colonial Governors gentlemen who have never previously been in the Colonial Service? I do not think it can mean that. If it does mean that, I take the liberty of saying that the method of expressing that sentiment is infelicitous.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00463">On the question of the appointment as Governors of gentlemen from outside the Colonial Office I wish to say a word. It has always been the practice, ever since I can remember at any rate, and I believe long before&#x2014;the noble Marquess who leads the House will no doubt confirm what I say&#x2014;for Secretaries of State not to feel themselves bound to recommend for appointment as Governors only officers already in the Colonial Service, and within limits, though I do say strictly within limits, I am quite sure that is good for the Public Service. Every now and then you get introduced into the Service a man of remarkable ability who not only does
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0150"/>
<col>249</col>
most valuable work for the State as Governor of the Colony to which he is sent, but whose permanent influence on the Colonial Service is very much to its advantage. I would give as an instance of such an appointment that of Sir Matthew Nathan, who was a Royal Engineer and Secretary of the Colonial Defence Committee, and who then became Governor of Sierra Leone, whence he went to Hong Kong and then to Natal and eventually back to the Civil Service, where he is now. Therefore I hope the noble Lord will quite clearly understand that I do not for one moment contend that it should be the practice of the Colonial Office never to make appointments to Governorships from outside the Colonial Service. But it is a very long step from that admission to the words of Colonel Seely&#x2014;
<quote>"It must be understood that a Governorship lies quite outside of the ordinary course of promotion in the Colonial Service."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00464">Just consider what the Colonial Service consists of. In the first place you have the Eastern Colonies&#x2014;Hong Kong, the Straits Settlements, and Ceylon. They are recruited in exactly the same way, and, indeed, by the same examination, as the Indian Civil Service and the Home Civil Service, and to suggest to a man who has entered the Service of the Eastern Colonies by that examination that a Governorship lies quite outside the ordinary course of the promotion to which he may look seems to me to be a very extraordinary and, indeed, serious statement. But putting aside those who have joined the Colonial Service by this method and taking those who have not passed the examination but have come into the Service either as the private secretaries of Governors or by nomination of the Secretary of State to some subordinate post&#x2014;a sub-inspectorship of police, an assistant native commissioner-ship, or one of the other methods of entry into the Colonial Service. Will your Lordships consider for a moment how important is that body of men at the present moment? Practically speaking the Colonies, in the sense of this question, are the Crown Colonies, comprising the Eastern group, which I have already mentioned; the West Indian group, the circumstances of which are rather peculiar; and the great West African and East African groups, and a group of Protectorates embraced within the geographical area of the Union of South Africa. In all those Colonies there are a body of officers who entered as boys or
<col>250</col>
at any rate as very young men, who have borne the burden and heat of Colonial Service often wider very trying conditions of climate, and who are looking forward to promotion one day. Think what the effect upon them must be of reading the words of the Secretary of State's mouthpiece, that a Governorship lies quite outside of the ordinary course of promotion in the Colonial Service.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00465">I venture to contend that there never was a moment when it was more important than now to get the best class of young men we can for the work in these Crown Colonies. What East Africa and West Africa suffer from, according to my experience, is that the inducements to enter that Service have not been sufficient, not that they have been too great but that they have not been sufficient, and every inducement that the Colonial Office can put forward to good men to take this as their career must redound to the advantage of the Empire and the good government of these Dependencies. If you want to realise what it must mean to these men to read such words, think of a parallel case. Take the case of men who have entered the Service of the Eastern Colonies through the same examinations as the home Civil Service. What would the home Civil Service think if they were told that the headship of a Department was quite outside of the ordinary course of promotion in the Civil Service? Or if men under the Foreign Office were told that an Ambassadorship was quite outside of the ordinary course of promotion in the Diplomatic Service? Or if a soldier was told that promotion to the rank of General lay quite outside of the ordinary course of promotion in the Army? Is it not obvious that a more depressing effect could not be produced than by the use of such words?</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00466">It is not really an answer to say that the difference between those Services and the Colonial Service exists in the fact that the Secretary of State reserves to himself the right occasionally to appoint as Governor a gentleman who had not previously been in the Colonial Service. I do not want for a moment to suggest that that reserved right should be abandoned; but I do say that it is an impossible step from the reservation of that right to what apparently is the meaning of the words used in the answer given by Colonel Seely in the other
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0151"/>
<col>251</col>
House. If those words are not explained, if they stand as they are&#x2014;I say it with the deepest regret&#x2014;it will be the ruination of the Colonial Service. How can you possibly expect good men to enter the Colonial Service if they are practically told that there is no chance of their ever achieving the position of Governor. It is one thing for them to be told that they will have to stand on their merits and that if there are very much better men outside the Service they may be brought in; but Mr. Harcourt would not even admit to Mr. Lyttelton that, if everything else was equal, the man in the Colonial Service was to have the preference. I am sure that was an omission on Mr. Harcourt's part; I cannot believe that he really intended it; and that is one of the reasons why I have brought this question forward. But Mr. Lyttelton did ask point-blank&#x2014;
<quote>"In the case of a Colonial Secretary, say, Of Ceylon, would not his claim be considered paramount to that of another person outside the Service of equal ability?"</quote>
Mr. Harcourt, to Mr. Lyttelton's immense surprise, did not reply in the affirmative, but merely said&#x2014;
<quote>"The only claim I consider paramount would be the question of merit."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00467">I began my observations by saying that I have some little knowledge of the feelings of officers in the Colonial Service. I am not exaggerating when I tell the noble Lord that these answers have produced absolute dismay in the Colonial Service. From the East, from Africa, from the West, from men in retirement here in London, the same story has reached me, a story of absolute dismay&#x2014;an idea that it is the policy of the Colonial Office to discourage in every way merit in the Colonial Service, and to tell the Colonial Service that any other kind of merit, although it has not borne the burden and the heat of the day in the tropical posts of the Crown, will be quite as likely, if not more likely, to receive the reward of a Governorship as the merit of a man who has given his life to the Service. I have already said that I do not suggest that a rule should be laid down that these appointments should never be given outside the Service, but I do say that the practice of giving them outside the Service should be less frequent in the future than it has been in the past. And for this reason. Because a large number of Governorships that were once within the reach of the Colonial Service have now passed outside the reach of that
<col>252</col>
Service. When I was first connected with the Colonial Office it was quite a common thing for an Australian Governorship to be a prize in the career of a Colonial Civil servant. That is so no longer, owing to no fault of the Colonial Office but chiefly owing to the great expense of the office and the fact that the salaries of Colonial Governors in the Australian States have been reduced. Therefore no longer can the Governorship of Australian States be looked to as the reward of Colonial Service; and with the Union of South Africa have departed four possible Governorships which members of the Colonial Service might have looked to for promotion. Instead of four Governors there is now one Governor-General. Therefore the whole of the Australian group of Governorships and the whole of the South African group are now removed from the sphere of ambition of the ordinary Colonial Civil servant. Consequently it is more necessary, I suggest, not less necessary, that promotion to the Crown Colonies proper should as far as possible be reserved for those who have spent their life in the Colonial Service, and that it should be the exception, the marked exception, for a man to be brought into one of these great Crown Colony Governorships who has not made it his life's profession to work for the Empire in the Colonies. I have elongated the Question on the Paper in order that the noble Lord might appreciate the exact point to which I invite his attention and to which I want an answer. That is, What was the real meaning of the somewhat singular words used in the House of Commons, words which, I am sure far from the intention of the Secretary of State, have spread dismay through the length and breadth of the Colonial Civil Service?</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00468"><i>Moved</i>, That an humble Address be presented to His Majesty for Papers relating to the appointment of Colonial Governors.&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Selborne</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00469"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT KNUTSFORD</member><membercontribution>: Perhaps your Lordships will allow me, as I have had some experience in this matter, to say a few words and to express my entire concurrence with what the noble Earl has said. I served in the Colonial Office from 1867 to 1874 as legal adviser and Assistant Under-Secretary, and I was Colonial Secretary from 1887 to 1892. Therefore I am justified in speaking of my experience because this question came up before me
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0152"/>
<col>253</col>
many times during those years, and I can confidently say that the policy of my time and of my predecessors was entirely the reverse of that stated by Mr. Harcourt. I can only hope that his words have been misconstrued.<lb/>
The experience of my time was that a Governorship lay "quite within" and not "quite without" the ordinary course of promotion in the Colonial Service, and that it was looked upon, unless there were any very special circumstances for departing from the ordinary course, as the reward for work which had been done by men in the Service as Colonial secretaries, treasurers, and in other capacities, in all parts of the world, in all climates, often at the risk of health, and indeed of life. I can endorse what the noble Earl has said as to this announcement being received with absolute dismay by the Colonial Service. I have heard from several in the Service who ask, "Is the whole of our chance of promotion to be altered in this way?" It must be remembered that we are not dealing now with responsible Governments, because those who enter the Colonial Service do not expect&#x2014;they may hope for it, but they have no right to expect&#x2014;promotion to the Governorship of responsible Colonies. We are dealing with Crown Colonies. I am perfectly certain that the rule up to the present time has been that those who had worked hard and shown themselves capable of administering in the minor offices and minor Governorships had a right to expect promotion to the higher Governorships.<lb/>
There are always special cases when exceptions have been and must be made to the rule. Where in the case of a Colony there is some special difficulty arising, for example, from financial or racial causes, the Secretary of State for the Colonies naturally has to look round to find a man who is specially adapted for the work, and it may be that there is not one at the time in the Colonial Service. In such cases it is recognised that there are special circumstances, and though some in the Service may feel that they have been passed over and complain, they are not justified in complaining. I wish to enforce on the noble Lord who represents the Colonial Office that unless it is the wish, which I cannot believe, to destroy the spirit of the Service and to lessen the hopes, and therefore the zeal and the good work, of the members of the Service, the
<col>254</col>
language of Mr. Harcourt must be explained and qualified. I feel that this is a most important question affecting a very great Service, and men who have done in that Service such good work all over the world. It is on that ground that I have ventured to trouble your Lordships with these few observations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00470"><sup>*</sup><member>THE UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (LORD EATMOTT)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, when I came down to the House this afternoon I wondered a little what line of argument the noble Earl who has made this Motion would adopt. I knew that he had almost unique experience in regard to this matter. He is himself a brilliant example of the success of a choice for a Colonial post of a man outside the Colonial Service. He was appointed to the most difficult and responsible Colonial post of his time, and he fulfilled his duties in a way which won the admiration, not only of those who are his political friends at home, but also of those who are his political opponents. The noble Earl also was for five years&#x2014;from 1895 to 1900&#x2014;the holder of the post which I now have the honour to hold, and during that time he must have had considerable experience of appointments to Colonial Governorships. I felt perfectly certain, therefore, that he was quite unlikely to treat this question on any narrow grounds, and he has, as a matter of fact, brought forward very cogent arguments in regard to this question and has based them on broad grounds of public interest.<lb/>
The noble Earl complains of a certain phrase used by my right hon. friend Colonel Seely in another place, and he complains also that the same phrase was repeated, or almost repeated, by the Secretary of State at a later date. Now what did Mr. Harcourt say? In reply to Mr. Lyttelton he said&#x2014;
<quote>"A Governorship lies outside the ordinary course of promotion both in the Colonial Office and in the Colonial Service. I see no reason for reconsidering or modifying the present practice, and I can assure the right hon. gentleman that the claims of the Service are fully considered whenever a Governorship becomes vacant, my only object being to get the best available man."</quote>
I think that the noble Earl has attached too much importance to his rendering of the earlier part, and has attached too little importance to the qualifications in the latter part of that reply, because Mr. Harcourt, in the latter part of his reply,
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0153"/>
<col>255</col>
does clearly signify that no change of practice has been made, is being made, or will be made. The noble Earl said that the phrase of which he complains could not simply refer to the fact that, as Governorships are few and the Colonial Service is a large Service, there are not many young men who go into the Colonial Service who can expect to become Governors. He said that the phrase could not mean that. He also said that he did not think that the phrase could mean that the Colonial Secretary reserved to himself the right to recommend outsiders to positions of especial difficulty for which they were specially suitable. Well, my Lords, I am very much surprised that such a cloud of suspicion should have arisen from this answer of the Colonial Secretary. The noble Earl has told us, and the noble Viscount who was Secretary of State for the Colonies a good many years ago has confirmed the statement, that this phrase has spread absolute dismay in the Service. If that is the case, I think the noble Earl has done a service in bringing the matter forward, because I hope to be able to blow away entirely all this cloud of suspicion.<lb/>
I can state in the most categorical way that no change has been made or will be made in the direction of seeking for outsiders instead of those who are already members of the Colonial Service when Governorships are vacant. Indeed, I can do more than that. I can give your Lordships some particulars which I think will show that so far from the present Colonial Secretary or any Colonial Secretary connected with the present Government having appointed more Governors from outside than were appointed, let me say, at the time when the noble Earl opposite was Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, there have, in fact, been fewer outside appointments of late than in the past. I have not gone far back in the researches that I have made in regard to this matter. I began only in 1895. But I may state generally, having looked at the papers in the office in regard to this matter, that there was a larger proportion of outsiders appointed before 1895 than since that year. I take the five years 1895 to 1900. The outside appointments made during those years were those of Sir West Ridgeway to Ceylon, Sir. West Ridgeway having before that time been Lieutenant-Governor of the Isle of Man; Sir Herbert Murray to Newfoundland, Sir Herbert
<col>256</col>
Murray having been before that Chairman of the Board of Customs; Mr. Sterndale, a retired member of the Indian Civil Service, to St. Helena in 1897; and Sir Matthew Nathan, to whom the noble Earl referred, who was first sent as Acting Governor to Sierra Leone and was afterwards appointed Governor of the Gold Coast. Sir Matthew Nathan was Secretary of the Colonial Defence Committee at the time of his appointment. Those are the only four appointments in the period from 1895 to 1900. But, few as those appointments were, the appointments of Governors to our Crown Colonies made since 1900 are fewer still. And may i say in regard to this matter that I am leaving out of account, as I must leave out of account I think, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Canada, amid the Military Governorships of Gibraltar, Malta, and Bermuda.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00474"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD EMMOTT</member><membercontribution>: Now I come to the period of the present Government. The only outside appointments made by the Liberal Government since they came into office in December, 1905, were, first, that of Sir Percy Girouard, who was Commissioner of Railways in South Africa and had special experience of railway construction, to the Governorship of Northern Nigeria. I do not think that his case is a real exception to the rule, but I give it for what it is worth. The only other appointment&#x2014;and this is hardly an outside appointment&#x2014;until I come to the tenure of office of the present Secretary of State is that of Sir Sydney Olivier, who was a principal clerk in the Colonial Office from 1904 to 1907 and had been Colonial Secretary in Jamaica from 1900 to 1904, and was sent out in 1907 as Governor of Jamaica. Those are the only two who were not actually in what is called the Colonial Service when
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0154"/>
<col>257</col>
they were appointed. The only appointment of the kind made by my right hon. friend the present Secretary of State for the Colonies is that of Major Chancellor to Mauritius in 1911. I abstain, of course, because we are not discussing this matter as one between Parties and Governments, from any question of <i>tu quoque</i>. I bring forward these figures to show that, so far from outside appointments having become more numerous as years have gone on, they have actually become less numerous, and I sincerely hope that they may become fewer still in the future. I hope I have met the case that has been made out; because if it be true, as the noble Earl and the noble Viscount have said, that so much suspicion has been aroused in regard to this matter, it is certainly very desirable that that suspicion should be dissipated.<lb/>
Just before I came down to the House this afternoon I had put into my hand a copy of <i>The Times</i> of December 2 last, in which appears a letter written by Sir Frank Swettenham dealing with this question, and if I ant not keeping your Lordships too long I would like to read one paragraph from that letter and comment upon it. Sir Frank Swettenham wrote&#x2014;
<quote>"It is not only that the men who enter the Colonial Service early, by the narrow gate of severe competitive examination, are to stand aside for military officers, who have been educated at Woolwich and elsewhere to perform entirely different duties, but this <i>dictum</i>&#x2014;that Governorships stand apart&#x2014;opens the door to every kind of jobbery; and when the Secretary of State suggests, as he did recently in the case of British Guiana, that the salary of a Governorship should be raised in order that he may be able to put in the post a really suitable man, he gives us furiously to think."</quote>
I mention that case because I want to say, first of all, with regard to British Guiana that the request for raising the salary came from British Guiana itself, and, secondly, to point out that the new Governor is Sir Walter Egerton, who was himself an Eastern Cadet and entered the Service by the door of examination. Therefore this particular case, which is held up as one which gives us furiously to think, is one in which the ordinary course of promotion from the Colonial Service has been followed, and as to which it is quite clear that Sir Frank Swettenham's suspicions have no foundation whatever. I have only one word to say in conclusion. I do not propose to detain your Lordships by going into the general question of what should be done to improve, to strengthen, and to
<col>258</col>
make more attractive the Colonial Service. That is a large question. All I need say now is that, as regards that part of the matter, I associate myself entirely with what fell from the noble Earl.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00475"><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to say a few words on this subject, as I know something about it. I had the honour of serving for some time in the Colonial Office, it is true not in the important and responsible positions held by my noble friend or by the noble Lord opposite, but I had the honour of serving as private secretary to Mr. Chamberlain, and I spent in the Colonial Office a longer period measured in hours than any one in this House, and one of my principal duties was to deal with these questions of patronage. I think we all received with the greatest satisfaction the assurance which the noble Lord has given us in explicit words&#x2014;namely, that no change in practice has been made, is being made, or will be made; and if he is saying that, as no doubt he is, on behalf of his chief, we must all be thoroughly satisfied.<lb/>
But I venture to say it would have been more satisfactory if the noble Lord had given us a somewhat simpler and less ingenious answer to the question put to him by my noble friend. I think the most satisfactory and obvious course would have been for him to say that the answers given to the questions in another place had been badly expressed, and that the meaning which had been read into those answers by an enormous number of members of the Colonial Service was not justified. That would have ended the matter, and nothing further would have been required. But the noble Lord opposite sought to justify the answer given by the Secretary of State and said that the latter part of it explained away the first part. It does not do anything of the kind. The latter part of Mr. Harcourt's answer was that he saw no reason to modify the existing practice. The question at once arose, What is the existing practice? Is it the practice existing only during the present <i>r&#x00E9;gime</i> or the practice existing in previous <i>r&#x00E9;gimes?</i> That is a doubt which at once occurred.<lb/>
When I had to deal with these matters as private secretary in the Colonial Office the answer given to the enormous number of people who sent in applications for
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0155"/>
<col>259</col>
Colonial Governorships was precisely the reverse of that which was given in the House of Commons. The invariable stock answer which I was directed to give in this correspondence was that Colonial Governorships were reserved in the ordinary course for members of the Colonial Service, and that it was only in very exceptional circumstances&#x2014;those stated by the noble Viscount earlier this evening&#x2014;that an outsider was ever appointed. That answer precluded any possibility of doubt on the part of members of the Colonial Service, and it also precluded false expectations on the part of outsiders who wished to obtain Governorships.</membercontribution></p>

Whether it was reasonable that they should be misunderstood is a. question which it is very difficult to answer. It is not always easy to state a phrase in a manner which cannot possibly be misconceived, and, of course, taken in a strict sense the answer given by my right hon. friends was perfectly true. The noble Earl opposite mentioned the case of a military officer. If you were to say that the various commands in this country which are held by Lieutenants-General are not in the ordinary run of military promotions&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00478"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Well, suppose one were to say that those commands were outside the ordinary course of promotion in the service of His Majesty's Army, I do not think that anybody would misunderstand what was intended. It is, of course, quite true that my right hon. friend the Secretary of State does not propose to alter what has been the custom for a number of years, which I take to be that when a vacancy occurs in a Crown Colony the list of those who stand high
<col>260</col>
for promotion is carefully considered in relation to the particular duties required of the Governor of the particular Colony, and, when that process has been gone through, if for one reason or another, whether for reasons of climate or whatever the reason may be, there is no gentleman there who appears to be entirely suited to the post, then the Secretary of State begins to look elsewhere.<lb/>
The noble Earl drew attention to the fact&#x2014;and from one point of view it is a serious fact&#x2014;that the possibilities of promotion for those who are in the regular Service have been seriously reduced of late. It is no doubt the case that, speaking generally, those who have to recommend appointments to His Majesty look outside the Service for the Australian appointments. It is not invariably so. I myself had the honour of recommending to a first-class Governorship in a Crown Colony a Colonial Governor, Sir George Le Hunte, who was a member of the Colonial Service and at that time Governor of an Australian State. I also had the pleasure of recommending for appointment to Queensland Sir William Macgregor, Governor of Newfoundland, an honoured member of the Service who is also a popular Governor of an Australian State. But, speaking generally, it can no doubt be said that the habit of looking elsewhere for Australian Governors is a confirmed one; and it is also, from the point of view of the Service, lamentably true that the South African Governorships have disappeared from the scene altogether. I do not think that as a matter of fact the position is misunderstood in the Service. I do not believe, for instance, that the entrance into the Civil Service of such men as Sir Percy Girouard, Sir Frederick Lugard, and Sir William Manning is in any way resented by those who have risen step by step in the Colonial Service.<lb/>
Since the noble Viscount opposite was at the Colonial Office a somewhat new state of things has arisen in the coming into being of a new class of Governorship&#x2014;namely, those great African Governorships for which special qualities are undoubtedly demanded, qualities which have been splendidly displayed by Sir Frederick Lugard and by Sir Percy Girouard, qualities not often to be found, perhaps, in those who have risen step by step in small

Colonies in quite different parts of the world; and therefore it is clear that there is always likely to be a certain incoming of outsiders, military officers and others, who possess special qualifications. But subject to those reservations I am quite certain, so far as my knowledge of the Colonial Office enables me to form an opinion, that future Colonial Secretaries will see that it is both fair and advantageous to allow it to be understood by members of the regular Colonial Service&#x2014;so far as it is a regular Service, because it is only a regular Service in a special sense

<title>SHOPS REGULATION ACTS CONSOLIDA<lb/> TION BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00489"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I desire to make an appeal to the noble Lord who is to move in a few minutes the Second Reading of the Shops Regulation Acts Consolidation Bill. This is a
<col>264</col>
Bill of twenty-two clauses and more than twenty pages, and it was only circulated to your Lordships this morning. I think in all he circumstances that this is not quite treating the House as it ought to be treated. I say nothing as to who is responsible. I understand that the Bill is only a Consolidation Bill, but still those who are interested would like to look through it. I am sure it would be interesting to the House to hear what the noble Lord has to say about the Bill, but the appeal I make is that after the noble Lord has made his statement in moving the Second Reading he should agree to a friendly Motion for the adjournment of the debate in order that we may be able to come to a consideration of the Bill with some understanding of it.<lb/>
Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00490"><sup>*</sup><member>THE PAYMASTER-GENERAL (LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in moving the Second Reading of this Bill I have to apologise to your Lordships for the fact, mentioned by Lord Balfour, that the Bill was only circulated this morning. I do not know whose fault it is, but when I introduced the Bill last week I was under the impression that it would be circulated in time to give your Lordships sufficient opportunity of studying its details. In the circumstances I am bound to say that I think the appeal made by the noble Lord, that the debate on the Second Reading should stand adjourned, is a very reasonable one, and I would suggest that next Monday would be a convenient day upon which we might resume the discussion of the measure.<lb/>
I do not think it is necessary for me to say very much at this stage, but I would like to emphasise the fact that this is really nothing but a consolidation measure. There are no extraneous matters introduced; there are no amendments of the existing Acts; and if your Lordships give the Bill a Second Reading I shall move that it be referred to the Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills which is to be set up on the Motion moved the other day by the Lord Chancellor. I understand that it would not be possible for any Bill involving extraneous matter to go before such a Committee; consequently your Lordships can rest assured that this measure is nothing but a Consolidation Bill pure and simple.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0158"/>
<col>265</col>
It is desirable that the Bill should go through without any delay, for this reason. The Act which your Lordships passed last session dealing with the question of shops comes into operation on May 1. Previous to that date it will be necessary for the various local authorities to issue regulations. The central authorities&#x2014;that is to say, the Home Office in England, the Secretary for Scotland in Scotland, and the Lord-Lieutenant in Ireland&#x2014;will have to issue a circular to the local authorities and others concerned, pointing out the provisions of the new Act and showing in what way they must be complied with. It would be more convenient if it were possible to issue that circular with reference to a Consolidated Act than with reference to all the Acts which it is now proposed to consolidate. The shopkeepers themselves will no doubt be in considerable difficulty in understanding the exact provisions with which they ate now called upon to comply unless this Consolidation Bill is passed.<lb/>
There are six Acts in existence dealing with this subject&#x2014;the Act of 1892, which deals with the hours of young persons in shops; the amending Acts of 1893 and 1899; the Act of 1899, which deals with the question of seats for female assistants in shops; the Act of 1904, which introduced the principle of early closing upon a sort of voluntary basis; and, lastly, the Act of last session. All these Acts refer to exactly the same subject. There is necessarily a certain amount of overlapping, and it would be extremely convenient, both to the Departments and to the public, if a Consolidation Act were passed and passed before April if possible. I do not think that a study of this Bill will reveal any difficulties to any student of it. If your Lordships will glance at it, you will see that in the margin reference is given to previous Acts from which the clauses in the present Bill are derived. In many cases they are copied <i>verbatim</i> and, I think, present no difficulty whatever.<lb/>
But there is one point of considerable complexity, and that is the question of the application of this Bill to Ireland, and it arises in this way. The Act of 1911, and, indeed, previous Acts, only applied to Ireland in part. The rural districts in Ireland were entirely excluded from the operation of the Act of last session. Consequently there is a difficulty in a Consolidation Bill&#x2014;it is merely a matter of drafting,
<col>266</col>
but it does present some complexity&#x2014;as to how best the case of Ireland can be dealt with. One or two alternatives presented themselves to the draftsman. The one selected is to set out in the schedule those parts of the Act which apply to Ireland. I do not know that I can elucidate this very much. It really is a Committee point, and when the Bill goes before the Committee believe it is the practice for the draftsman to attend, and he will be able to explain to the Committee why he thinks this the simplest way to accomplish the desired end. However, my Lords, I think it is only reasonable that we should adjourn this discussion for a few days in order that your Lordships should have an opportunity of studying the Bill a little more at leisure, and I have pleasure, therefore, in agreeing to the adjournment until Monday.</membercontribution></p>

</ol></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00496">The noble Duke said: My Lords, I beg to ask the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War the Questions standing in my name on the Paper. In the first set of Questions I merely ask for the numbers of officers and men in the Third and Fourth Battalions of the Special Reserve, and I do not think any explanation is needed. My second set of Questions relate to Section D of the Regular Reserve. I ask the noble Viscount what number of men from this Section he will require to complete the mobilisation of the six Divisions of the Expeditionary Force in 1913, and also whether he considers that these men in Section D are fit for competent duties with the first line.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00497">At first sight Section D would not appear a very important part of our military forces. I think, however, I shall be able to show your Lordships that Section D raises some points vital to the efficiency of our Regular Reserve. Let me explain shortly what Section D of the Army Reserve is. Those men who, after having completed their full term of Colour and Reserve service&#x2014;a total of twelve years for the Infantry&#x2014;are willing to re-enlist within six months in the Army Reserve for a further period of four years are known as Section D of the Army Reserve. This Section D used to be called the second class of the Army Reserve in distinction to Sections A and B, known as the first class of the Army Reserve. Under the Reserve Forces Act of 1882 Section D men are referred to as the Second Division, and were "not liable to be called out on permanent service until directions had been given for calling out the whole of the First Division in Sections A and B." These words were repealed by Section 1 of the Reserve Forces Act of 1900, which stated&#x2014;
<quote>"Men in the Second Division of the first class of the Army Reserve shall be liable to be called
<col>268</col>
out on permanent service, notwithstanding that directions have not been given for calling out the whole of the first division on such service."</quote>
The result of the amendment to the 1882 Act is that both Divisions of the Army Reserve are now called out together. But the fact of calling out the Second Division at the same time as the First does not make the older men of the Second Division of the same fighting value as those in the First.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00498">The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, who then represented the War Office, informed me in November, 1010, that&#x2014;
<quote>"Section D is not the second class of the Army Reserve. It is now always classed in the first class of the Army Reserve."</quote>
This means that the second quality is mixed with the first, and the blend described as first class only. The country cannot form an accurate estimate of the value of the whole Reserve except you differentiate between the men passing from the Colours direct into the Reserve and the men re-enlisting into a section of the Reserve on completion of their full term of Colour and Reserve service. I should like to see the Regular Reserve kept in two classes and called first and second class, a distinction every man can understand. The batch of Reservists with whom I am dealing are the product of the three years of Colour service and nine years of Reserve service term of enlistment. Hence their minimum period of absence from the Colours is nine years and the maximum is thirteen years. Of these men the noble Viscount estimates to have, in round numbers, 30,000 by October 1, 1913.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00499">There are three matters in connection with Section D of the Army Reserve which should be considered&#x2014;first, the source of supply and its limits; secondly, the numbers required by the noble Viscount front that section to complete the mobilisation of the six Divisions of his Expeditionary Force and other mobilisation schemes; and, lastly, the ability of Section D men to perform combatant duties. The source of supply must be limited to the number of men who pass out of the Regular Reserve year by year after completing their twelve years of Colour and Reserve service. The enlistment is optional and consequently uncertain, but men who are not in a position to lose 6,<i>d</i>. a day are pretty sure to re-enlist,
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0160"/>
<col>269</col>
provided always that they are passed as medically fit for active service. The outflow from the Reserve is now quite abnormal. When the extraordinary outflow ceases, then Section D must dwindle.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00500">I ought to explain that last year the noble Viscount, when dealing with the Army Estimates on March 15, offered to time-expired soldiers of twelve years Colour and Reserve service three forms of re-enlistment&#x2014;first, to re-enlist direct into the Special Reserve; secondly, to re-enlist into Section D of the Army Reserve; thirdly, on completion of four years in Section D, then to join the Special Reserve. The question arose as to whether men on completion of twelve years Colour and Reserve service would prefer to enlist into Section D, or go directly into the Special Reserve. On this point the noble Viscount and the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, when Under-Secretary of State for War, took exactly opposite views. I infer, therefore, that their military advisers&#x2014;I have no doubt they very well know their business&#x2014;have given to each noble Lord precisely the advice which they knew would please him best at the particular moment. We all know how much pleasanter it is to get the expert opinion you want rather than the one you do not want. Lord Lucas, in a letter to the Press on July 8, 1910, wrote&#x2014;
<quote>"Section D fills quickly whenever it is opened,"</quote>
and he added that&#x2014;
<quote>"the Army Council base their conviction on years of experience."</quote>
But then what the noble Lord wanted to prove was the certainty of getting a large number of men in Section D.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00501">Then comes the noble Viscount last year. He, on the other hand, cared nothing about the numbers of Section D, the point not being under discussion. His aim was to show an unfailing source of supply from which to fill the attenuated ranks of his Special Reserve battalions. So in explaining the Army Estimates on March 15, 1911, he stated that&#x2014;
<quote>"Comparatively few men go to Section D,"</quote>
which shows that the noble Viscount has a supreme contempt for the convictions of the Army Council even when based on years of experience. The noble Viscount
<col>270</col>
meant to make his plan fill the ranks of the Special Reserve, so he clenched his argument by stating that&#x2014;
<quote>"The Special Reservists get better rates of pay."</quote>
Now, if the noble Viscount will inquire into this matter he will find that he has got his figures wrong. The 6<i>d</i>. a day of the Section D men mounts up to more by some 45<i>s</i>. at the end of the year than the pay and all the allowances of the Special Reservist. Again, life in Section D means no military training and 6<i>d</i>. a day in your pocket for certain. The Special Reservist must undergo four weeks' training a year, during which time, if he offends against discipline, he will find himself mulcted of much of his money, and if he is absent will be apprehended as a deserter.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00502">Our present position is that we have lost nearly 37,000 men from the Colours since 1905, and that 39,617 men (in round numbers 40,000) will pass out of the great Reserve created by Lord Midleton between October 1, 1911, and October 1, 1913, as shown by the Annual Report on the British Army published in 1911. Of these 40,000 the noble Viscount estimates that he will re-enlist in Section D in round numbers 30,000 by February 1913. All 1 can say is that if 30,000 a re re-enlisted the medical examination must be merely nominal. The Under-Secretary of State for War has informed us that no statistics are available on this point. In four years time this batch of 40,000 men who enlisted sixteen years before will finally pass out of the Army&#x2014;a matter which may possibly affect the noble Viscount's successor more than the noble Viscount himself. The noble Viscount seems to have realised that these reductions in the Regular Army and its Reserve are rather too sweeping. So we see him now engaged in trying to keep together the numbers of the Regular Reserve by asking time-expired men in the big Reserve which he inherited from his predecessor to re-enlist for another four years. By this simple plan, if at all successful, the noble Viscount may pass on to his successor the task of building up again the Regular Reserve but without the material for which he is indebted to Lord Midleton.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00503">Then as to the total number of Section D men required by the noble Viscount to complete the mobilisation schemes which he is pledged to the country to carry out.
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0161"/>
<col>271</col>
The noble Viscount requires, according to his statement on March 14, 1911, 9,840 (in round numbers 10,000) time-expired soldiers for his Special Reserve battalions. It is quite certain that if the men prefer to enlist into the Special Reserve&#x2014;and the noble Viscount has told us that comparatively few men go to Section D&#x2014;then Section D of the Army Reserve must be depleted. In estimating the strength of Section D in future 10,000 men must be deducted for service with the Special Reserve. The noble Viscount has set up a competition for time-expired soldiers between the Special Reserve battalions and the Army Reserve, and he must make allowance for its effect.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00504">Then I beg to ask the noble Viscount the number required from Section D to proceed abroad at once with the six Divisions of the Expeditionary Force if mobilisation takes place after October 1913. I must explain why I ask for the number in 1913. Next year Sections A and B of the Regular Reserve will be at their lowest, and the reductions in the Regular Army which the noble Viscount has initiated will have been realised. It is the weakest link in the chain by which the strength of the chain is determined, but for several years that link is not going to be appreciably stronger. In 1914 there will be an increase of 4,000 men in Sections A and B of the Regular Reserve; in 1915 another 4,000, and in 1916 another 1,000. A possible but by no means a certain addition of 9,000 men spread over three years is not going to make the whole difference to our position in the world as a military Power.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00505">My last and most important point is the fitness both professional and physical of the Section D men for combatant duties in the First Line. It is well to have a clear idea of what the duties are which these reenlisted Reservists&#x2014;that is, Section D men&#x2014;will be required to perform. Let us assume that mobilisation takes place in view of a contingency which it is idle to suppose we contemplate as remote&#x2014;namely, the employment of the six Divisions of the Expeditionary Force on the Continent of Europe. These men will have been absent from their regiments and engaged in civil life for a minimum of nine and a maximum of thirteen years without any military training. Then, within at most three weeks of rejoining the Colours
<col>272</col>
they will have to face the best of Continental troops. Will they be fit for an ordeal of that kind? Will they be a source of strength or of weakness to their units on the battlefield? That is the question I beg to put to the noble Viscount.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00506"><i>Moved,</i> That an humble Address be presented to His Majesty for Papers relating to Section D of the Regular Reserve.&#x2014;(<i>The Duke of Bedford.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00507"><sup>*</sup><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Duke has not given me much time, as he only put down his Questions yesterday afternoon, but I think I am in a position to give him the desired information except on one point&#x2014;I mean the information for which he asks as to the details of mobilisation. On that subject I think we ought to be stricter than we have been in the past. No other nation in the world gives its mobilisation details, and therefore I am afraid I cannot give the noble Duke this information. But I can give him a good deal of information in regard to the other points.<lb/>
The first set of Questions which the noble Duke has put to me fall under three heads. Under the third head he asks for the total strength of the non-commissioned officers and men of the seventy - four Third Battalions of the Special Reserve, the difference between strength and establishment, the number under twenty years of age, and the number of non-commissioned officers and men whose term of service expires before February 1, 1913. He will find a great deal of this information, which, of course, he had not before him when he put down these Questions, in the General Annual Report of the Army which was published yesterday afternoon. He will there find a great deal of information directed to the points which he puts, but there are certain points which are not covered in the Annual Report. The Report, for instance, does not distinguish between the seventy-four Third Battalions and the twenty-seven Extra Special Reserve Battalions. I think it will be possible for me to get the information for which the noble Duke asks without putting an undue strain upon the persons concerned, but he will, I hope, be content to take it as from October 1 last. To get it as from February 1 would be to set the record officers to work at a time when they are very busy with other things, and the
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0162"/>
<col>273</col>
three months cannot make any material difference for the noble Duke's purpose. I shall be able to give him the information as from October 1 last.<lb/>
Then as regards the first and second Questions which he puts to me. I can give him an answer as to those. The General Annual Report gives the establishment and strength of officers of the Special Reserve on October 1, 1911. It does not, however, give the numbers by ranks and does not distinguish those who were transferred from the Militia. Nor, again, does it separate the seventy-four Third Battalions and the twenty-seven Extra Special Reserve Battalions. But I think I can give him the information. In fact, there is a Return moved for in the other House which gives a great; deal of it, and I will see whether I cannot include in the Return the further point for which the noble Duke asks. Therefore I think I shall be able to give the noble Duke all the information he desires, except that it will be from October 1 last instead of from February 1.<lb/>
Then I come to the point raised by his second set of Questions. As regards the requirements on mobilisation, that, for the reasons I have indicated, I hope he will not press for. I do not think t would be right that we should make public statements on that point. But I can tell him what the general position of things is. In the first place, there are 22,870 men in Section D at the present time, but we can to-day mobilise without these and have a substantial surplus over. Nor have I any reason to anticipate that we should be in a difficulty in the years which are immediately coming on. The noble Duke talked of the Reserve being there because of Lord Midleton's three and nine years system. No doubt that is quite true. The noble Duke also pointed out that the Reserve would go clown. Of course it will go down, because the men who will come in and drive it down are the nine. years and three years men of Mr. Arnold-Forster's <i>r&#x00E9;gime</i>&#x2014;nine years with the Colours and three years with the Reserve. You therefore want a smaller Reserve for that time. But that system obtained for only a short period.<lb/>
Then we get to the present system of seven years and five years for the Infantry, and six years and six years for the Artillery.
<col>274</col>
But the seven years with the Colours and five years with the Reserve for the Infantry is the material point. On that we calculate for a Reserve which will amply cover what we desire. That Reserve is more elastic than it used to be, and for this reason. Though you know what you want for the requirements of all the units taken together, you are never sure how you stand about particular units unless you closely follow their changes. There may be, for instance, a regiment of Infantry where the commanding officer has been easy going and has allowed men to continue their service, and in that case the Reserve falls accordingly. There may be another where men have been allowed to go freely to the Reserve, and there the Reserve is large. Consequently we have to study each unit, and we encourage men in a unit which requires a large Reserve to go to the Reserve. In other cases we do not. The result is that while it is impossible for me to say what proportion of Section D is required, because the units do not depend on the same proportions, it is possible for us to keep our hand on the unit and to see that it is making a proper Reserve. A system of operations for this purpose was introduced a little more than a year ago.<lb/>
Broadly speaking, the position is this. We have more than enough to mobilise without Section D just now. We may require Section D for individual units. We may require Section D in the future at the time of the transition, but I do not think that is likely to be materially so. The reason the Reserve will then be small is that the men will be serving for a longer time with the Colours and therefore fewer Reservists will be required to mobilise. When we are in the normal we have a quite sufficient Reserve, but it is good to have Section D and we shall always keep our hand on Section D, not only became there may be an unforeseen shortage in the Reserve but because there may be individual units which are required to be built up for the reasons I have given. Therefore, though this Section may seem superfluous, we propose always to keep our hand on Section D, expanding it and contracting it as seems most convenient. The noble Duke sees that I cannot properly answer the question of the number of Section D men we should use on mobilisation. I have no doubt we should use some for individual units, but we do not require Section D at present for the whole.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0163"/>
<col>275</col>
Then I come to the question of how they are to be used. We should, of course, always use Section B men in preference to Section D&#x2014;that is to say, we should take the men who have more freshly come from the Colours in preference to men who had been some time from the Colours. The noble Duke spoke of Section D men as men who had been a long time from the Colours. No doubt that is so in the case of men who have served for three years with the Colours and been nine years in the Reserve, but that is a class which is largely falling away. In the case of the seven years and five years service, it is obvious that your Section D men have not been a long time away from the Colours, and still more is that so in the case of those who have been nine years with the Colours and three years in the Reserve. A man enlists, say, at the age of eighteen and leaves at thirty. There is often several years' excellent service in him at that time, and he has only been away from the Colours five years and has been in the Reserve during that period. Under the system we now have we are satisfied that Section D contains a large number of useful men; otherwise we should not keep it alive.<lb/>
Then as regards the number of trained men over twenty years of age available in a unit in peace time, that also is a varying factor which governs the number of Reservists required. The noble Duke knows that if we were sending troops to India we should not send men under twenty, and that would mean that we should require a larger number of Reservists. That is a varying factor which one has to keep in view, and which may govern the extent to which we keep up Section D. Another element which introduces a certain degree of variation which we have to watch closely is this. As I have said, in units, particularly in Infantry battalions, which have a large number of men over twenty in them serving with the Colours and a small Reserve, we allow men to transfer to the Reserve prematurely in order to keep up the Reserve of these units, but we never can tell for certain how many will avail themselves of that. In the good state of recruiting which obtains now we can always get recruits, but we do not know how many men in the Colours will go prematurely into the Reserve. I think I have now covered the bulk of the Questions which the noble Duke put to me. If
<col>276</col>
there is anything I have omitted 1 have no doubt he will let me know, and I shall be happy to do my best to give him the information.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00508"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member><membercontribution>: I am very much obliged to the noble Viscount for his promise to give me the information about the Third and Fourth Battalions of the Special Reserve, and I should be very much obliged to him if he could differentiate between the Third and Fourth Battalions.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00510"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member><membercontribution>: The noble Viscount was somewhat reticent as to the number of Section D men he would require with the six Divisions of the Expeditionary Force. Possibly the noble Viscount would have no objection to my setting down on a future occasion on paper the figures which have been supplied by the War Office and which bear directly on this point, and asking him for further information. As regards the fitness of these men for service abroad, the noble Viscount alluded to the fact that in the future the three years Colour and nine years Reserve men would disappear. But at present Section D is composed of men who have been absent from the Colours from nine to thirteen years. The men of Section D were tried on active service in South Africa and were found there to be very unsatisfactory. With your Lordships' leave, I should like to read the evidence which was given on that point before the South Africa War Commission by Sir Thomas Kelly-Kenny and Lord Methuen, because it has an important bearing on Section D. The following questions were put to Sir T. Kelly-Kenny by Sir G. Taubman Goldie&#x2014;
<quote><i>Q.</i>&#x2014;Did you see much distinction in duality between Reservists and the men who in had been serving up to date?</quote>
<quote><i>A.</i>&#x2014;1 think there was a distinction in the older Reservists, the Section D, but in the case of the others who had not left the ranks long I did not see very much.</quote>
<quote><i>Q.</i>&#x2014;You did not hear of any difficulties as regards discipline?</quote>
<quote><i>A.</i>&#x2014;I did with regard to Section D&#x2014;in fact, I experienced them myself; when they came up they grumbled a great deal.</quote>
<quote><i>Q.</i>&#x2014;But the other sections were quite up to the mark of the soldiers who were in the ranks before?</quote>
<quote><i>A.</i>&#x2014;I think so.</quote>
<quote><i>Q.</i>&#x2014;They had not lost their military habits?</quote>
<quote><i>A.</i>&#x2014;No, they had not; I could not trace anything against the Reservists I had.</quote>
<quote><i>Q.</i>&#x2014;Except Section D?</quote>
<quote><i>A.</i>&#x2014;That is so.</quote></membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0164"/>
<col>277</col>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00511">Then I come to the evidence given by General Lord Methuen. He was asked by the Chairman, Lord Elgin, as to the marching, and Lord Methuen replied&#x2014;
<quote>"As soon as the weak men were weeded out and the troops were in condition there was no question as to the men marching well. I cannot ever recollect the men not being ready to do more than asked them to perform. I gladly include the Militia and the Volunteer companies in this statement. As long as the men are well fed and taken care of by their officers one need not fear stragglers. I except, as a rule, the men of Section D from the above remarks, as they fell out, and we left a good many behind at different places."</quote>
<quote><i>Q.</i>&#x2014;What does that mean with regard to Section D?</quote>
<quote><i>A.</i>&#x2014;They are men having special qualifications. I was going to say they are more or less veterans who go into Section D.</quote>
<quote><i>Q.</i>&#x2014;And he (a Section D man) is a man who has gone through the Reserve and is allowed to come back?</quote>
<quote><i>A.</i>&#x2014;Yes, and only for special reasons he is allowed to go on.</quote>
<quote><i>Q.</i>&#x2014; He may have fallen out because he was physically unfit?</quote>
<quote><i>A.</i>&#x2014;That is so, I think, because he was more or less a cripple.</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00512">Lord Methuen is more than satisfied with the marching and willingness of the men in the Regular Army, the Militia, and the Volunteers, but he especially excepts the men in Section D. He tells us they fell out and that he left a great many behind at different places. He describes them as veterans, and on the point of physical fitness he describes the type of man as a cripple. Sir T. Kelly-Kenny places them in a class by themselves, and that is what ought to be done now. The noble Viscount ought to differentiate between the men in Sections A and B and in Section D by calling the re-enlisted men the second class of the Army Reserve and not relying on them for First Line duties. The fact is the non-commissioned officers and men in Section D have been too long away from the Colours. Take the case of the noncommissioned officers. They pass to the Reserve and re-enlist in Section D with the same rank with which they left the Colours. A non-commissioned officer who has been in civil life for twelve or thirteen years must be unfit to command serving soldiers in action within three weeks of rejoining.<lb/>
Again, I must remind the noble Viscount that whereas the men condemned by Lord Methuen and Sir T. Kelly-Kenny had been absent from the Colours from five to nine years, the men upon whom he relies will
<col>278</col>
in some cases have been absent from nine to thirteen years, because they are the Reserve product of the three years' Colour service term of enlistment, thus not only intensifying but in some cases even doubling the unfitness due to the prolonged absence from the Colours on account of which Lord Methuen and Sir T. Kelly-Kenny condemned the Section D men for active service. I can also quote a colleague of the noble Viscount. The present First Lord of the Admiralty, who speaks with a considerable war experience, said during the debate on the Army Estimates on March 5, 1910, whilst praising the Army administration of the noble Viscount, that&#x2014;
<quote>"Men who had only been three years with the Colours and who had been away six, seven, eight, and even nine years frail the Colours could not be satisfactory soldiers on whom to rely at a moment of need."</quote>
But this is not a case of eight or nine years absence, but of twelve or thirteen. The noble Viscount has not produced any evidence to show us why men who were unfit for active service in South Africa after nine years of absence from the Colours are fit for the Expeditionary Force on the Continent of Europe after twelve or thirteen years of absence in civil life. The evidence of Field-Marshal Lord Methuen and General Sir Thomas Kelly-Kenny makes it absolutely certain that Section D men are not fit for service with the Expeditionary Force, and that to rely upon them for the fighting line is the organisation of defeat and not of victory.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00513"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: It is quite true that Lord Methuen and Sir T. Kelly-Kenny took the line stated by the noble Duke, but at that time Section D was a much less organised body than it is now, and I think a great many of the men did not clearly understand that they could be taken back to the Colours and sent out to South Africa. Consequently there was a great deal of grumbling, and much of the evidence collected by the noble Duke turned on the grumbling.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00514"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member>. Lord Methuen specially says that the Section D man was more or less a cripple and could not march, apart from his grumbling.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00515"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: I know he said that about some of them, but there was a
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0165"/>
<col>279</col>
great difference of opinion. The noble Duke has quoted Sir T. Kelly-Kenny and Lord Methuen. I should like to read an extract from the evidence given by General Sir R. L. Rundle&#x2014;
<quote><i>Q.</i>&#x2014; Did you find that class of Reservist differ from another?</quote>
<quote><i>A.</i>&#x2014;No, not a bit.</quote>
<quote><i>Q.</i>&#x2014;We have heard from some witnesses that the Reservists, having been away for some time from their regiments, were not quite acquainted at first with the modern conditions or even with the rifle that they were called upon to use. Did you find any difficulty in that respect?</quote>
<quote><i>A.</i>&#x2014;None. I never found any difficulty. Of course, naturally there was a certain amount of rustiness; but that must be expected. It was fully made up by the increased intelligence and the extra age of the men who came back, and it very soon wore off.</quote>
I give that as the view of another distinguished General to show that even then there was not a consensus at all about the utility of Section D, and I have no doubt that to this hour there is a good deal of difference of opinion; but I think it is plain that, if a man has only been away five years from the Colours and is of the age of thirty or thirty-one, there is no reason to expect that he has forgotten very much. That is different from the case of a man who has been away for a longer
<col>280</col>
period, and the normal of Section D will certainly be considerably shorter than that of the Section D men to whom the noble Duke referred and who are beginning to pass away.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00553"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I beg to ask the noble Marquess who leads the House a Question of which I have given him private notice. I should like to know whether he is able to add anything to the information which we already possess as to the progress of the strike in the coal trade. I may say that in asking this Question I imply, of course, that we should be glad of any information which the noble Marquess is able to give us as to the further action which may be contemplated by His Majesty's Government. At the same time the noble Marquess is aware that nothing could be further from our thoughts than to press for any information which it would be undesirable in the public interest should be made known at present.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00554"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: Before the noble Marquess replies, I also have a Question to ask of which I have given him private notice. It is whether his attention has been drawn to a speech delivered at Ebbw Vale by Mr. George Davies, one of the delegates at the Miners' Conference, in which he is reported to have declared that Mr. Asquith said something in his speech to the miners last week which had not yet appeared in the Press, to the effect that "the day was not far
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0168"/>
<col>285</col>
distant when His Majesty's Government would make themselves responsible for getting a minimum wage for all workers in the country"; whether Mr. Asquith's speech on the occasion referred to has been fully and accurately reported, or whether any part of it has been deleted from the official report.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00555"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (THE MARQUESS OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am much obliged to both of the noble Marquesses opposite for giving me notice of the Questions which they desired to put. With reference to the Question asked by the noble Marquess who has just sat down, it is quite clear that there has been complete misunderstanding on this matter. There is no foundation whatever for the statement that the Prime Minister in his speech made any statement with reference to a general minimum wage. The story is altogether without foundation. As regards the latter part of Lord Londonderry's Question, the speech was reported in the ordinary way and was subjected to the kind of general correction which speeches of that sort receive, but no material deletion of any kind was made and the substance of the speech was accurately reported in the daily Press.<lb/>
With reference to the more general Question asked by the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition, it is clearly not necessary for me to go into any detail with regard to what has passed, because all the circumstances are quite familiar to your Lordships through the means of ordinary information up to the time when the deadlock occurred. It would be, I am sure, a mistake to speak of the deadlock as necessarily involving a permanent stoppage of negotiations, because the differences so far as they relate to facts are by no means necessarily insuperable. But the deadlock has occurred, and in the meantime the Government are not taking any active steps as between the two parties. But that is not to say that the Government are idle. They are taking such steps as are possible to form an independent opinion on the figures which have been put forward with reference to a possible minimum wage in various districts in order to see how far those figures as published form a basis for possible agreement between the two parties. That is all that I am able to tell your Lordships at present. I under-
<col>286</col>
stand that the Prime Minister is making a statement in another place, and though he may, perhaps, develop his reply somewhat more fully as regards matters of which he has special cognisance he will not be able to make any statement with regard to the future of a fuller character than I have been able to make.</membercontribution></p>

<title>IRELAND AND GREENWICH TIME.</title>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00558"><member>LORD INVERCLYDE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask his Majesty's Government, in view of the generally expressed desire in commercial circles in. Ireland in favour of the extension of Greenwich time to Ireland, whether any action is proposed to be taken. I will first give my reasons for saying that it is generally desired that a uniform time&#x2014;namely, Greenwich time&#x2014;should be adopted throughout the United Kingdom, and will begin by quoting the views of two Cabinet Ministers on the subject. The Postmaster-General, on November 7 last, wrote&#x2014;
<quote>"I find that the change would be of some advantage as far as Post Office arrangements are concerned, provided it was made general throughout Ireland."</quote>
And last year the Chief Secretary for Ireland said in the House of Commons&#x2014;
<quote>"Personally he was in favour of the proposed change, but it could not be effected without legislation, which the Government could not undertake unless it was non-contentious."</quote>
He stated that he had received twenty-five petitions from Ireland in favour of uniform time, and none against.<lb/>
This question has received considerable attention throughout Ireland and the proposal has met with support wherever it has been raised. The Association of Chambers of Commerce of the United Kingdom have passed a resolution in favour of it. The Chambers of Commerce of Dublin, Belfast, and Londonderry have also done so, and all the big carrying com-
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0169"/>
<col>287</col>
panies have expressed themselves in favour of it. Nowadays transit between this country and Ireland is so frequent and has increased so much in speed that the two countries are now so close together that the difference in time is a matter of great inconvenience. Again, those of us who are engaged in business with Ireland communicate almost daily by telephone and telegraph, and if one is not careful inconvenient questions are apt to arise through blunders being made owing to the difference in time. Therefore commercially we all earnestly desire that the Government should see their way to deal with this question, so that a uniform time may be arrived at.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00559"><member>THE PAYMASTER-GENERAL (LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the facts are as the noble Lord has stated. Greenwich time prevails throughout almost every country in Western Europe, and there has been a movement for some years to have Greenwich time adopted in Ireland. Under the Act of 1880 Greenwich time is the standard time in Great Britain, and Dublin time is the standard time in Ireland. So far as the Irish Government are concerned, the question was first raised in 1898, when a communication was addressed to them by the Scottish Geographical Society. The Royal Astronomer in Ireland was asked to report, and he reported strongly in its favour. He pointed out that the difference between Greenwich time and local time in Ireland varied from 22 to 42 minutes. He did not think that even the 42 minutes would be excessive, in view of the fact that a greater difference of time prevailed in Austria and Sweden without raising inconveniences; and there is, of course, the further point that it is the eastern point of Ireland which is far more important from a commercial point of view and there the difference is least. It is also true that various Chambers of Commerce have petitioned for the adoption of Greenwich time&#x2014;those of Belfast, Cork, Dublin, Limerick, and Waterford; and last year the Association of Chambers of Commerce, which met under the presidency of Lord Brassey in Dublin, petitioned in favour of this proposal. It has also met with the support of local authorities and railway companies in Ireland.<lb/>
There is a good deal to be said in favour of the proposed change. Uniformity is one of the considerations of the moment. Another result would be something in the
<col>288</col>
direction of daylight saving. It is computed that nearly 100 hours would be gained in Ireland. Of those hours a very large proportion would be available for recreation by those classes who leave work at, say, six o'clock. There is also, of course, the argument of economy. In view of those facts the Chief Secretary said in another place on October 26, in answer to a Question addressed to him, that he personally was in favour of the change. I may say that a Statute would be necessary, because the Act of 1880 would have to be repealed. The Chief Secretary added that if it could be regarded as a non-contentious matter he personally would have no objection whatever, and would be glad enough to see it adopted; but he pointed out that, in the then state of affairs in the House of Commons, he could not see his way to be responsible for a contentious measure. The position remains unchanged in that respect. Might I suggest to the noble Lord that this matter might well form the subject of a Private Bill? If the noble Lord is sufficiently interested, there would be nothing to prevent him introducing a Bill dealing with this subject. He would then be able to see what support it got in this House and in another place, and even if he was not successful this year it might possibly lead to the achievement of his object in the future.</membercontribution></p>

<title>MUSIC AND DANCING LICENCES BILL.<lb/> [H.L.]</title>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00563"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL STANHOPE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, fortunately for me, perhaps, this Bill does not in any way touch the thorny question of the censorship. It is merely a Bill to amend the law under which licences to hold entertainments of music and dancing are granted in respect of buildings in London and parts of certain adjoining counties. The principal object of the Bill is to enable licences for music and dancing to be granted at any period of the year instead of only at the Licensing Sittings held at Michaelmas, which is at present the law with regard to London and its immediate neighbourhood. Other parts of the country have already, under the Public
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0170"/>
<col>289</col>
Health Amendment Act, 1900, the powers which are sought for under this Bill; but the cities of London and Westminster and within twenty miles thereof still come under the Disorderly Houses Acts, 1751 and 1818. Under those Acts any house, room, garden, or other place kept for public dancing or music or for other public entertainment of a like kind is deemed a disorderly house unless a licence for the purpose has been obtained, and may be proceeded against by any two inhabitants "paying scot and bearing lot." who, under the Act, receive &#x00A3;10 each for their services if a conviction is obtained. It is obvious that such a procedure is entirely obsolete. I think it is also obvious that it is an absurd situation that a great city such as London should be in the position of not being able to grant licences to buildings for possibly ten or eleven months. If an application is made now for a licence for music and dancing, that licence cannot be granted until the Licensing Sittings next Michaelmas. The county of Middlesex has already, under the Music and Dancing (Middlesex) Act, 1894, cleared itself from the limitations imposed by the Disorderly Houses Acts. Generally this Bill is on the lines of the Middlesex Act of 1894. It has received the unanimous countenance and support of all the county councils concerned, and particularly of the London County Council, whose Bill this is and on whose behalf I am acting.<lb/>
I now turn to the clauses of the Bill. Your Lordships will observe in Clause I that the area to which the Bill applies embraces the whole area covered by the Act of 1751 with the exception of the county borough of Croydon, who have already made other arrangements which they desire should continue to stand. There is also a small part of the county of Buckingham to which the Act of 1751 has never been applied, and they naturally see no reason why they should have an amending Act. Clause 2, as to definitions, maintains the present position under the Acts of 1751 and 1818. Clause 3, which is, I think, the important clause in the Bill, is on the lines of the Middlesex Act, and it also re-enacts some of the provisions of the Act of 1751, which it is proposed to repeal. There is one exception to that general statement, and that is in subsection (4). Your Lordships will observe that by that subsection a person to whom the licensing authority has refused to grant
<col>290</col>
or transfer a licence shall not be entitled to again apply for the grant or transfer in respect of the same premises within three months from the date of such refusal. The clause also ensures that ordinary applications shall be made at the annual meeting of the licensing authority, but it does give power in exceptional cases for a licence to be granted at any other time.<lb/>
Clause 4 lays down the fees which are to be charged for licences. They are considerably higher than those which have been put into similar Acts, but I think your Lordships will agree that they are not too high, at any rate as regards the county of London, when I say that it is estimated that these increased fees will not even cover one-half of the estimated cost of the inspections. The remainder of the cost, of course, will have to be borne by the ratepayers. The fees are 5<i>s.</i> a month under the Theatre and Cinematograph Acts and also under the Middlesex Act, as against the larger fees in this Bill. But, on the other hand, I might mention that in New York the fees charged are 500 dollars, and that in Chicago they range from 500 to 1000 dollars. Clause 5 imposes penalties for keeping open premises without a licence. Subsection (1) imposes the same penalty as is now charged under the Metropolis Management and Buildings Act. 1878, with regard to protection from fire in buildings of a similar character. It is felt that it would be unwise to have a lower penalty under this Bill, as it would lead to considerable inconvenience and houses would naturally desire to come under this Bill rather than under the other Act. Subsection (2) is on the lines of the Middlesex Act, the only difference being that the date of the offence is taken as the date from which the fine shall commence, instead of the date of the conviction. Clause 6 is merely a re-enactment of Clause 4 of the Act of 1751. Clause 7 is similar to the clause in the Middlesex Act. The exceptions to buildings coming under this Bill are proposed to be the same as at present exist. There is no desire to include buildings which are not already under these licensing authorities. Clause 8 lays down the date of the commencement of the operation of this Bill should it become law, and fixes the date at November 1 in order that the next meeting of the licensing authority should be held under the provisions of this Bill. Clause 9 merely repeals the enactments mentioned in the Schedule
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0171"/>
<col>291</col>
which are either re-enacted in this Bill or have become unnecessary owing to its provisions. I do not think the House will consider the Bill a contentious one, and I trust, therefore, that your Lordships will see fit to give it a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00564">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>Earl Stanhope.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00565"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with the general principle of this Bill the Government are in agreement. It is very desirable that the licensing authorities should have power to grant occasional licences and to transfer licences at other times than at the Michaelmas sittings. This was recommended by the Select Committee on Stage Plays which sat in 1909. The Committee said&#x2014;
<quote>"The licensing authority should have full power to grant occasional licences and to transfer licences from one person to another during die twelve months for which the licence has been granted. On both of these points the present law needs amendment."</quote>
This Bill is founded, I believe, on the Act of 1891, under which the county of Middlesex got what the noble Lord desires should be extended now to the whole of the metropolis.<lb/>
When this Bill reaches Committee, if your Lordships give it a Second Reading, I shall move one or two Amendments. In the first place, it is desirable to bring Croydon into line with the other authorities. Unless there is very good reason why it should be left out of the arrangement, I think it would be much better that there should be a general uniform method applicable to all. The only other point I will mention to-day is with regard to Clause 5&#x2014;the penalties clause. It is the universal practice, I believe, to make fines date from the conviction and not from the date of the offence. I hope that in Committee the noble Earl will agree that it will be much better to adopt the universal practice with regard to penalties, and not set up a new system as is done by this clause. Subject to these Amendments and one or two others on small points which may occur to me before the Bill goes into Committee, the Government have no objection to the Bill and will give it their support.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE ARMY RIFLE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00567"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HARDINGE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask the Secretary of State for War whether in the event of the Expeditionary Force having been called out for service abroad last September, the rifles of that Force would have been inferior to those of the German Army. This question is to my mind of such vital importance to that branch of His Majesty's Forces with which I have been connected for so many years that that must be my excuse for bringing it forward again this evening. It will be within the recollection of your Lordships that when we had a debate upon armaments about a fortnight ago I put this same question to the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War, and, as your Lordships are aware, I failed to receive any reply. Since that time the Under-Secretary for War has stated in public, at a meeting of the London Rifle Club, that this subject of the new rifle is of the greatest importance, for not only are the leading armies of the world better equipped with small arms than our own troops, but several of the smaller nations have adopted rifles which are claimed to be superior to those of the leading Powers. If that statement is true, I do not think it will be difficult to understand why the noble Viscount refrained from answering my question. I trust that in the circumstances your Lordships will consider that I am justified, in the interests of the Army, in bringing this question again before the House, and I hope that the noble Viscount will give us far more information on the subject to-day than he did on the last occasion. If the noble Viscount agrees with Colonel Sealy as to the rifle, it appears to me that the issue of the new rifle brooks no delay.<lb/>
I venture to think that most of your Lordships will agree that an important subject such as this should not be lightly passed over, at any rate by this House, for this is not a Party question. It is a national question. It not only affects the safety of our troops when on the field of battle, but it also affects the security of our shores. When the noble Viscount on February 20 rose to deal with the points that ware brought forward on that occasion, he said&#x2014;
<quote>" I think it will be convenient that I first deal with the question of armament."</quote>
As your Lordships are aware, instead of doing so he proceeded to make a somewhat lengthy defence of the Military Correspondent of <i>The Times.</i> We were told
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0172"/>
<col>293</col>
that this gentleman received &#x00A3;500 per annum from public funds as editor of the <i>Army Review,</i> which I would like to point out to your Lordships is only published quarterly, and that at the same time he was permitted to write independently for papers such as <i>The Times.</i> Therefore this gentleman is not only a paid officer of the War Office, but also a paid servant of a public newspaper. I venture to think that such an appointment has never hitherto been known in the history of the War Office, and, as I said the other day, it is not surprising that the majority of the officers in the Army regard the articles of the Military Correspondent of <i>The Times</i> as simply written to champion the present administration of the War Office, and, therefore, as of no value at all. The noble Viscount pointed out that though the Military Correspondent of <i>The Times</i> was editor of the <i>Army Review</i> he did not have access to papers at the War Office without the leave of the chief of the Imperial General Staff. That question has since been brought forward in another place, and therefore I will not touch upon it again.<lb/>
But with regard to the rifle, I am aware that other noble Lords on this side of the House also had complaints that during the armament debate a fortnight ago they did not get any definite answer from the noble Viscount on the points which they brought forward. My noble friend Lord Stanhope, in his able and forcible speech, brought out, in my opinion, a very potent question. He asked, "Who is responsible for the fact that our Army has been equipped for six long years with a rifle and ammunition not up to modern requirements? As your Lordships are aware, he received no answer to that question. In fact, the noble Viscount hardly replied to the noble Earl's remarks at all, except to say that his speech was a most interesting one. I quite agree with the noble Viscount there; and any one who heard Lord Stanhope's speech could not have failed to recognise that he was an expert on the subject and was speaking of what he knew. As far as I could gather, the main line of defence of the noble Viscount with regard to the present rifle was this, that the English soldier could fire out of his rifle double the number of rounds in a given time that could be fired out of the German rifle; that is to say, without bringing the rifle down from his shoulder, meaning to imply that the rifle was more or less used auto-
<col>294</col>
matically. In spite of that assertion, however, the noble Viscount said later on, when speaking of the automatic rifle&#x2014;
<quote>"The waste of ammunition and the inaccuracy in shooting which comes from it counterbalances&#x2026;the advantage in the number of bullets you can send out of the muzzle in a minute of time."</quote>
If he holds that view with regard to the automatic rifle, how does he contend that our rifle has any superiority over that of the German rifle?<lb/>
During the recent debate we came to this universal decision, that the weak spot in the Lee-Enfield rifle was its breech action. No one can doubt, however, that with its turned down bolt lever we are in this respect in advance of other countries. Other countries, too, are at a disadvantage in not having the hand-guard in front of their rifle for rapid firing. The point that some bring out&#x2014;that our rifles hold ten bullets and those of other nations only hold five&#x2014;is, in my opinion, a doubtful advantage. But on the other hand the breech locking action of Continental rifles is well known to be far superior to that of our rifle, whilst their sighting is far simpler, more especially that of the French rifle with its battle sight. In the course of the noble Viscount's remarks respecting our rifle, he advocated that one of the great points about it was its lightness, that it could be quickly brought; up to the shoulder and down again. With all respect to the noble Viscount, I do not agree that that is much advantage, and for this reason&#x2014;that in modern warfare, as the noble and gallant Field-Marshal who sits on the Cross Benches (Earl Roberts) well knows, the standing position for which that is useful is never used on the field of battle; in fact, the prone position is invariably used and nothing else except, perhaps, the sitting or kneeling position. But no one who has had any experience of our rifle can doubt that the greatest objection to it lies in this&#x2014;the flatness of the trajectory of foreign rifles as compared with that of our own; and there is no question, if that is true, that our troops the moment they go on to the field of battle are at a great disadvantage&#x2014;a disadvantage which I contend no nation can afford to run, more especially a nation with a small Army like ours, an Army which is now represented in part by a Special Reserve only partially trained annually in rifle shooting, and by Reserves hardly trained at all.<lb/>

A few months ago this country was on the verge of war, and if it had taken place it would have necessitated the Expeditionary Force going to the Continent. Are we sure that that situation will not very soon, or in a very short time, recur? Surely, then, it is the duty of the military authorities at the War Office to hasten the issue of the new rifle before it is too late, so that our troops when they do take the field will be, if not on a superior, at any rate on an equal, footing with the troops of other Powers. In this connection it must be remembered that 80 per cent. of the casualties in battle result from rifle bullets, and our deficiency in respect to the rifle could not be compensated for by any superiority in regard to Artillery. That is my reason for asking the Question on the Paper, and I hope that the noble Viscount will give me a definite answer and will also state what he proposes to do in the immediate future.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00568"><sup>*</sup><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Viscount began his speech with something like a resolution of virtue, but before long he had got away into a still more attractive topic than his friend the rifle, and that was the Military Correspondent of <i>The Times,</i> who seems to exercise a fascination for the noble Viscount comparable to that which King Charles's head exercised over a certain historic personage. I will not, however, pursue the subject of the Military Correspondent of <i>The Times,</i> which is not germane to this question.<lb/>
The noble Viscount, in his Question on the Paper, asks whether the rifle which we now possess would have been, in the event of the Expeditionary Force having been called out for service abroad last September, inferior to the rifle of the German Army. I think it would have been inferior to the rifle of the German Army in very material points, but none the less I add to that that it would have been a very serviceable rifle and one with which no troops need have been afraid to go into action. It has various advantages which the rifle of the German Army has not. It is not the case that a flat trajectory is everything. A flat trajectory is important, but there are other things to be taken into account. A flat trajectory merely means that if you take aim at a man say 800 yards away, you
<col>296</col>
have a better chance than with a high trajectory of hitting somebody in between whom you did not aim at. With a high trajectory the man standing in between and at whom you did not aim would have the bullet go over his head, but with a flat trajectory there would be a chance, although he would have to be a tall man indeed if he was in the centre of the line of fire, of his being hit. But for hitting the man at whom you are aiming, one trajectory is for all purposes practically as good as another. If you are aiming at a man 400 yards away you naturally sight for a man at 400 yards, and the rifle with a high trajectory is as good as a rifle with a low trajectory. Moreover, a rifle with a high trajectory has compensating advantages. If the high trajectory is caused by the heavy weight of the bullet, then the bullet hits with more force and the accuracy is greater. But I am not here to say that it is not an advantage to have a flat trajectory. It is an advantage, but not the only advantage.<lb/>
It is some time since the Army had the advantage of the noble Viscount belonging to it. A good many things have happened since then, and if he had had to do, as the experts of to-day have to do, with comparing the qualities of rifles, he would know that a great many things are now taken into account. One in particular in these days of rapid firing is the possibility of covering the intervening space with a large volume of lead. For that purpose a light handy rifle has advantages over a long and heavy rifle, and in the new rifle we are endeavouring to preserve the great advantages which the short rifle, the rifle which was introduced by my noble and gallant friend who sits on the Cross Benches, possesses; but our purpose is to combine with those advantages a trajectory as flat as we can get it, for the reason that it is an advantage for the flight of your bullet to be low so as to cover the intervening space. The General Staff, however, inform me that it is an advantage which is a good deal exaggerated, because when you are sighting any one 800 yards away there are not usually people intervening. But it is one, at all events, among other advantages, and so long as you can have it without sacrificing the handiness of the short rifle it is an advantage worth obtaining. One reason why we are proceeding with a new rifle is to get a larger charge than is possible with the existing rifle.</membercontribution></p>

<col>297</col>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00569"><member>LORD SALTOUN</member><membercontribution>: I beg the noble Viscount's pardon, but did he say that he is proceeding with a new rifle?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00570"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: Yes, the pattern is approved for trial, and manufacture on an experimental scale will proceed. I will say a word about that presently. The great difficulty with the existing rifle is that the breech-chamber is too small. Consequently you cannot get in a large charge, and you cannot get as great a muzzle velocity as otherwise you might obtain. The way that has been dealt with in the new rifle is that the breech-chamber is larger and will allow of much greater pressure. The noble Viscount spoke as though all you had to do when you had adopted the pattern of a new rifle was to make it and issue it at once. I can assure him that there is a great deal more to be done. First of all, you have to do what necessitates a great deal of experiment on a large scale; you have to determine the proper charge and the relation of the charge to the bullet. We shall not have determined that satisfactorily until this rifle has been used on a considerable scale. Therefore we are at present proceeding to manufacture a considerable number of them for the purpose of arming one or two battalions which can practise over a prolonged period with the new rifle, and at the end of some months furnish us with satisfactory materials on which to decide whether or not we have got the right form of charge and the right form of bullet.<lb/>
There is every kind of question to decide. There is the question whether you should use shred cordite or small tubular cordite, or whether you should use flake cordite. These considerations involve scientific and mathematical problems of a high order, so complicated that the result has to be obtained largely experimentally. The German Army changed their charge almost the other day. They adopted an entirely new cartridge notwithstanding that their rifle had only been brought out in 1908. The reason why we cannot do as much as we would wish with the existing rifle is that the chamber is not large enough. That is why we have adopted a new rifle, and these experiments on a large scale are necessary before we know exactly how we stand. The new rifle we have adopted has the flattest trajectory in the world, and I think it possesses a great many other advantages. I should be sorry to say
<col>298</col>
that nobody will discover a better rifle in the course of the next few years, but what I wish to emphasise is that the important point is not so much the rifle as the cartridge. If you make a rifle with a large enough and strong enough breech-chamber you can put in new ammunition as new ammunition presents itself. We think we have the best ammunition; but what we do not know is whether we have got the cordite in the most perfect form for a high pressure rifle.<lb/>
Meantime the steps we have taken are these. Although the existing pattern of rifle does not admit of as large a charge as we are attempting, it admits of a considerably larger charge than we have ever had before, and the new cartridge with which four Divisions of the Expeditionary Force were armed last December, and with which the whole six Divisions will be armed in the course of a month or so&#x2014;the new cartridge for which we have taken a large sum of money in the Estimates this year&#x2014;contains a considerably larger charge, and we get a substantially increased muzzle velocity and a trajectory which is four feet lower than the trajectory of the present rifle. These things are never accomplished very rapidly. If they are accomplished very rapidly, failure and disappointment result. Far the most difficult part of the problem is the ammunition in its relation to the bullet. That can only be determined by experience. As soon as we know that we have hit upon the right form of ammunition, the right proportion of what is in the cartridge and what is in the bullet, we shall, now that we have determined the rifle, proceed very rapidly. If an automatic rifle is invented which fulfils Service requirements we shall take to it at once and without difficulty, because the new rifle is so adapted that it would be able to take ammunition suitable to an automatic rifle, and all that we would have to do would be to proceed with the manufacture of automatic rifles and substitute them. It is the wildest notion that you can invent a rifle out of your head, so to speak; still more that you can adapt the ammunition for it without most careful consideration. Every Power that has adopted a new rifle successfully has done so after the most minute care. Our rifle is the most modern of all rifles, and but for its defective breech-chamber we should have been able to put in a charge which would have made it equal to any.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0175"/>
<col>299</col>
The new rifle, as we believe, will be in calibre, in the weight of the bullet, in the size of the charge, and in the qualities of the rifle, superior to anything which at present exists in the world; but I do not wish to rush into the arming of the troops with it until the troops have had some opportunity of using it experimentally on a large scale, and until we can be sure that it is the best rifle. Meantime we have, by adopting the new ammunition, taken steps which give us a very serviceable weapon, nearly as good as the French, something short of the German in point of trajectory, but possessing advantages over both in the rapidity of fire and the consequent volume of lead that can be sent from it in a given time over a given space. My answer to the noble Viscount's question is that if, unfortunately, some cataclysm had taken place which had called for the use of our troops last summer or at any other recent time, we should have found ourselves with a rifle inferior in trajectory to the Continental rifle, but nevertheless a very serviceable weapon, possessing in many respects advantages over the Continental rifle, and not a rifle with which our troops need have been afraid to go into action.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00572"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: Very soon now. The specimen rifle has been completed and we are proceeding to the experimental manufacture. A considerable number will be manufactured at once. There is to be no delay.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00573"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL STANHOPE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I did not intend to take part in this discussion, but one or two of the remarks made by the noble Viscount are so extraordinary that I feel compelled to draw attention to them. The noble Viscount made a great point of the fact that if you aimed at a man 800 yards away you would hit him whether the trajectory was high or low. That is perfectly correct, but, as the noble Viscount knows, the real difficulty in shooting in the field is to judge the distance. It is almost impossible, under varying conditions of atmosphere and of ground, to judge distances accurately. You have not always a range-finder at hand, and it is obvious that if you estimate the distance at 800 yards and it happens to be 700 you are more likely to hit the enemy if your trajectory is low than if it is high. In other words, with a low trajectory you increase the
<col>300</col>
area of danger space. Every soldier will agree that that is the point in favour of a low trajectory, not whether anybody would be standing 400 yards away while you are firing at an object 800 yards distant.<lb/>
In the previous debate the noble Viscount referred to the remaining velocity of the heavier bullet. I made the remark then that our bullet compared badly with the German bullet at all ranges, and the noble Viscount promptly denied that statement. It is quite true that the German bullet has less striking velocity and less remaining energy beyond a certain distance, but the German bullet is better than ours up to that distance. It is better than our bullet up to 1,100 yards; there is nothing to choose between them up to 1,500 yards. But in all drill books it is held that effective rifle range is only up to 1,400 yards; after that it is considered long range firing. Therefore the point of the remaining energy of our bullet as compared with the German bullet is not worth consideration. I entirely agree with the noble Viscount that the cartridge is, if anything, more important than the rifle. But that only brings out the extraordinary statement he made on the previous occasion. I have an impression that he has edited the remarks he then made to some extent, and that as printed in the Official Report they are not quite so serious as at the time he made them. He then remarked that the old bullet could be used in the converted rifle and that it would make quite fair shooting, but I think he has since put in the words "up to 500 yards." If the sighting of a rifle is of any value at all, it has to be accurate. The sighting that is right for one bullet is absolutely wrong for the other, and that holds true at all ranges, though less so at ranges under 500 yards. In war at short ranges men are going to lay as flat as they possibly can, and therefore it is not a question of whether you can hit a man standing at 500 yards or so. The question is whether your rifle is absolutely accurately sighted, and the probability is that you will have to consider hitting a man the top of whose head is not more than eighteen inches at the outside from the ground.<lb/>
The point that will have to be raised when it comes to the question of the Army Estimates is the far more serious situation as regards ammunition. I not by any means satisfied, either by the remarks of the noble Viscount or by the information
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0176"/>
<col>301</col>
with which we have been supplied, as to the state of the ammunition during last summer, and, in fact, up to the present time. I have not yet been able to discover what reserve of ammunition we had of the old type, because most of the rifles, in fact practically the whole of the rifles, of the Expeditionary Force had then the old sight, and I think this House will desire to know what reserve of old ammunition we had to go with the old rifle. The other point made by the noble Viscount on the last occasion was that the reformed rifle, if I may so call it, could use the old bullet. Well, perhaps it can; but I should like to know whether the old rifle can use the new bullet. The new bullet is longer than the old one, and it is a question whether it can go into the magazine at all. That is a matter on which we desire information, because obviously if you reduce your rifle to single-loading instead of charger-loading you do away with the whole of the advantages which the noble Viscount mentioned with regard to rapidity of fire. Secondly, there comes the serious question whether you would not send your troops into action possessing a rifle sighted accurately for a certain bullet but supplied with another bullet. There is nothing that I can imagine which would so materially affect the <i>morale</i> of troops in action than to feel that their rifles were 80 badly sighted that they were not able to hit the object aimed at. I hope the noble Viscount will on a future occasion make clear the position in which we stood last summer, not only with regard to the rifle, but with regard to ammunition.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00574"><member>LORD SALTOUN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am loth to take part in this discussion, but I feel that we have gained a great point from the noble Viscount, and after what he has said I hardly think it is worth while continuing a discussion about the old rifle. The noble Viscount has assured us that we are going to have a new rifle and a new bullet, and that our troops will very shortly&#x2014;I hope he will be able to give us a definite date&#x2014;be armed with the new rifle. If that is so, and the rifle then will be as good as, or better than, any rifle possessed by a Continental Army, I think we must accept his statement with great gratitude, and I do not think there is anything to be gained by looking back at the past. I quite agree with the criticisms that have been passed on the old rifle, but what I think is far more important is
<col>302</col>
to know that a new and improved rifle is to be issued to our troops. We hope that the experiments to which the noble Viscount referred will shortly be put in hand, and that the bullet and rifle when issued will be of such a calibre as to excel those possessed by any Continental Power. If the noble Viscount could give us any sort of assurance how soon the troops will be armed with the new rifle we should feel still more satisfied.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00575"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: The new rifle is in a completed form and is at the War Office, where it is to be seen alongside the rifles of other Powers and our present rifle. I do not wish to make public the details of it, but if any of your Lordships would care to go and look at it and compare it with other rifles I shall be only too glad to arrange for an inspection. As regards the question put to me by the noble Earl opposite, there was a mythical rumour, which originated in a sensational evening paper, to the effect that we only had last summer 150 rounds of ammunition for each man of the Expeditionary Force. That was a ludicrous rumour. I do not propose to go into the details of the ammunition we had, but I may say that we had in reserve three times the amount that was shot away in the whole course of the South African War. The ideas of the General Staff about the reserve of ammunition which we should possess have gone up, and we have been accumulating ammunition. Last summer we even brought some from the enormous stores at Malta. We are passing to the new cartridge from the old, and we hope presently, so far as the Regular troops are concerned, that time old ammunition will not be required. We have taken in the Estimates this year a very large sum for the new ammunition. I do not think your Lordships need be at all troubled about the reserve of ammunition at this moment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00576"><member>LORD SALTOUN</member><membercontribution>: Can the noble Viscount give us any assurance as to when the new rifle will be issued?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00577"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: It is impossible to say. It depend, upon how the relation of the powder to the bullet progresses. We have already determined on provisional cartridges, but how they will stand the experiments on a large scale to which we intend to subject the firing qualities of the rifle remains to be seen. That is why we have thought it necessary to have with the new ammunition the old rifle in a service-

What I should hope for is that in a very few months we shall have determined something at any rate approaching to the idea of charge for the new bullet, and that we shall then be able to begin the manufacture of the new rifle and proceed with the work until the whole of the Army is armed with it.</membercontribution></p>

<title>FACTORY AND WORKSHOP BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00578" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00579">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00580"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is a very short Bill. It consists of one clause, its object being to repeal Section 157 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901. The necessity for this Bill has arisen out of a recent decision in the High Court. Under Section 116 of the Act of 1901 the giving of particulars of work and wages to pieceworkers is made obligatory. Section 116 applies in the first instance only to workers in textile factories, but by subsection (5) the Secretary of State is empowered by special Order to extend the provisions of the section to any class of non-textile workers. In 1909 the Secretary of State did make such an Order applying the provisions to the wearing apparel trade. That Order was accepted by the great majority of the trade, and it was not until 1911 that the authority of the Secretary of State was challenged by an individual named Alexander. This resulted in the case of <i>Seal</i> v. <i>Alexander,</i> which was brought before the magistrate and subsequently carried to the High Court. In that case it was held that the effect of Section 157 is to exclude from the provisions of Section 116 pieceworkers who receive their work from workshops in which only men are employed. Therefore it was held that the Secretary of State had no power to make the Order in question.<lb/>
It results from this decision that, while outworkers to whom work is given out from factories and other classes of workshops, and also outworkers to whom work is given out from shops, warehouses, or any other place which is not a men's workshop, receive particulars of their work and the rate of wage to be paid for the work, outworkers who get their work from men's workshops do not. This constitutes a very anomalous and undesirable state of things, for there is no logical reason why men's workshops alone should be exempted from
<col>304</col>
the provisions which apply to almost every kind of factory and workshop. It is very undesirable that outworkers and pieceworkers, who in many cases may be women, should not have the advantage, enjoyed by textile traders in all these other factories, of knowing what their work is and what they are to be paid for it. Under the present state of the law an employer is enabled to play fast and loose with his outworkers: to state in vague terms what the particulars of work are and what will be paid for it, and then when the work is done to modify the conditions which the men or women believed they were to enjoy. It is therefore proposed to extend the provisions as to work and wages to men's workshops.<lb/>
Your Lordships may, perhaps, ask why it is that Section 157, which exempts men's workshops, is to be found in the Act of 1901. There is not any particular reason for it; there certainly is no logical ground for it. The explanation probably lies in the fact that factory legislation has grown up from dealing first with women and children only. The first Act concerned the textile trades; then legislation was extended to other trades and to men under certain conditions, and so forth. This is merely one of those instances of an area which is not yet covered by the general provisions of the Factory and Workshop Acts, and I think it is very desirable that the anomaly should be removed.<lb/>
The amending of Section 157 of the 1901 Act will do rather more than make employers liable to give particulars of work and wages. Among the provisions of the Act which would, as a consequence, become applicable to men's workshops may be specially mentioned those which require a reasonable temperature, adequate ventilation, provision of sanitary conveniences, provision of washing accommodation, and the keeping of a general register with a record of accidents and poisoning. There, again, I submit that it is not unreasonable that owners of men's workshops should be expected to do in these matters what other employers are called upon to perform. In view of these facts, and seeing that this is nothing but a very small advance in factory legislation and an advance on well recognised lines. I hope your Lordships will be prepared to give the Bill a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00582"><member>The MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to raise one point only with regard to the Bill which the noble Lord has just explained. Its effect is, as he has told us, to make Section 116 of the Factory and Workshops Act of 1901 applicable to men's workshops in like manner as to other workshops. The effect of this change in the law is to oblige the owners of these workshops to introduce a number of modern improvements into their premises: to see that they are properly warmed, properly ventilated, adequately provided with sanitary conveniences and washing accommodation. Now all these are admirable things, but they are expensive and are improvements which take some time to carry out. The question which I wish to ask is this. Am I wrong in believing that the Bill as it now stands would come into operation from the moment that it passed both Houses of Parliament? If that is so, I would suggest to the noble Lord that he should consider whether a clause might not be added giving reasonable notice&#x2014;say six months, or something of the kind&#x2014;to those who will be affected by its provisions. I will not press for an answer now. If the noble Lord will kindly tell me that he will consider the point before the Committee Stage I shall be quite satisfied.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00583"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: The point, made by the noble Marquess certainly appears to be a very reasonable one. I am not quite certain whether he is right in thinking that the Bill would come into force immediately after its passage. I think that is so. But if the noble Marquess will allow me, I will consider the point and see how far it is possible to meet his view.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00584"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I would point out that there is a distinction between the two cases with which it is proposed to deal. The first provision is that all outworkers who are employed in men's workshops should receive particulars in the same way as those do who are employed in ordinary factories. In that case there does not seem any reason why the provision should not come into force at once. But in regard to the other provisions, which, as a consequence of the passing of this Bill, would become applicable to men's workshops, I think it desirable there that some reasonable notice should be given.</membercontribution></p>

<title>SHOPS REGULATION ACTS CONSOLIDA<lb/> TION BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00586">Debate on the Motion for the Second Reading <i>resumed</i> (according to Order).</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00587"><member>LORD HAVERSHAM</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to call attention to a new clause in this Bill which did not appear in the Bill which was presented to us last year. I refer to Clause 2, which provides that no person under the age of 18 years shall be employed about the business of a shop for a longer period than 74 hours, inclusive of meal times, in any one week. The fact that this is inclusive of meal times does not get rid of the difficulty. Meal times generally mean an hour for dinner and half-an-hour for tea, which at the outside is 8 hours a week. Therefore these young persons might be employed for 66 hours, or for nearly 13 hours a day, at the will of the employer. I cannot think that that is intended. It must be remembered that one of the six days is only a half-day. Therefore the young person might be employed for 66 hours during the 5, working days. There is another reason why this provision should not be agreed to&#x2014;namely, that there will be a tendency for employers to work up to the maximum; the maximum of hours will be what will be demanded, and the minimum will be the exception. Again, I do not know of any shop that would be open so long. A shop is usually open from 8 o'clock in the morning until 8 o'clock in the evening, but under the clause in question these young persons might be compulsorily kept at the shop several hours longer during the week, at the will of the employer, and it seems to me that it is of no use to the employer to have them there at a time when the shop is not, likely to be open. I should like to ask what reason there is for this new clause and why such a long period of employment is allowed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00588"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: I would remind the noble Lord that this is a Consolidation Bill. We do not in any part of the Bill alter the law as it at present stands. This clause is taken <i>verbatim</i> from the Act of 1892. We have no power in a purely Consolidation Bill to make any amendment in the law.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00589"><member>THE EARL OF GALLOWAY</member><membercontribution>: I should like to ask the noble Lord a question concerning one point in the Bill. I refer to Clause 4, which enacts that every shop
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0179"/>
<col>307</col>
must be closed not later than 1 o'clock in the afternoon on one week-day in every week. If your Lordships refer to Clause 10 you will find that the expression "shop" includes any premises where any retail trade or business is carried on, and the expression "retail trade or business" is interpreted as including the sale of refreshments or intoxicating liquors. The effect of that is that restaurants will come under the closing order mentioned in Clause 4. I quite agree that the object of giving a half-holiday every week is a good one, but in the case of restaurants the provision is extremely hard because some of the <i>employ&#x00E9;s</i>&#x2014;cooks and others&#x2014;do not go to business until midday. Therefore the provision in the Bill means that the restaurant employer will have to pay a whole day's wages for one hour's work. Perhaps the noble Lord in charge of the Bill will look into that point before the Committee Stage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00590"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (EARL LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to explain that this is purely a consolidating Bill and does not alter the law. There has been a custom during the past five or six years, which I am glad to say has been encouraged by both Houses of Parliament, of selecting branches of the law in order to put the law in an intelligible shape by means of consolidation or codification Bills. The law in regard to shops is not altered a jot or title by this Bill, which merely states in a single Statute what the law is, without obliging people to look through law books and successive Statutes to ascertain the law. This Bill will be referred to a strongly composed Joint Committee on which the legal element will be well represented. I have, at the request of the Joint Committee, presided over their proceedings during the last few years, and our constant endeavour has been to prevent any alteration in the law at all. If, however, there is any alteration in a small matter, it is necessary that we should report it and lay our Report before both Houses of Parliament before the Bill reaches a further stage. If on such a Bill as this we are to have a discussion on the merits of the law as it is, we shall have to abandon the practice of consolidation which has been so successful during recent years. It is only by their being treated as Consolidation Bills that we get the necessary facilities for them in both Houses of Parliament. This is, I repeat, a purely
<col>308</col>
consolidation Bill. Therefore I hope the noble Earl will not think us disrespectful if we say that we really are not discussing the merits of what the law is.</membercontribution></p>

But I would point out to the noble Earl, Lord Galloway, that he is mistaken in his interpretation of the provision to which he called attention, for if he will read subsection (6) of Clause 4 he will find that certain trades and businesses are exempted, and if he examines the Bill further he will find that restaurants are one of the businesses which are so exempted.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00595">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00596"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT GALWAY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in asking your Lordships to give a Second Reading to this Bill I would point out that a Bill of a similar character was introduced and passed through your Lordships' House last session, but owing to various reasons, into which I need not now enter, it did not make progress in another place. I have slightly amended the Bill since last year. In the Bill as it is now before the House I do not propose to include municipal authorities. It refers to county councils and to county councils alone, and I think your Lordships will admit that it is the
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0180"/>
<col>309</col>
duty of county councils to keep the communications through the county and between one county and another open in perfect order. County councils perform the duty of keeping their roads in good condition, but, in the case of a recognised ferry, if the ferry boat goes down to the bottom of the river there is no power to allow a county council or to compel any person to place another ferry boat on the river in order to keep the communication open. I know a case in which a county council maintains an excellent road down to an old ferry, but the ferry boat is at the bottom of the river and there is no power to compel any one to put another boat on the river. The county council are anxious to do so, but there is no power to enable them to acquire the ferry. The County Councils Associations support this Bill as a matter of public utility, and I sincerely hope your Lordships will give it a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00598"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ALLENDALE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Viscount, as he has reminded you, introduced a similar Bill last year, and I can only repeat what I then said on behalf of His Majesty's Government, that they do not offer any objection to the Bill and are, in fact, prepared to support it. Although the Bill is likely, as I think the noble Viscount admitted, to have only a limited application, there seems to be a <i>prima facie</i> case for it, and if it passes it should prove of utility in certain places such as those to which the noble Viscount referred. I had observed that, as he has pointed out, the scope of the present Bill is limited to county councils and does not extend to municipal boroughs and district councils. I need not say anything as to the desirability or otherwise of this limitation, but it may in consequence be necessary to amend the Bill in some points of detail. As ferries are usually of local utility rather than of service to a whole county, with the, possible exception of cases where the ferry serves to link up two main roads, the borough or district council or a combination of two or
<col>310</col>
more such authorities would seem the more suitable body to maintain it than the county council. It does not appear quite clear whether it would be right to charge upon the whole area of the county expenses incurred in respect of a ferry which was only of local benefit, and it is a question whether powers should not be given to county councils to charge the expenses incurred in respect of any particular ferry as special expenses on the parishes benefited by the maintenance of the ferry. One or two drafting Amendments will also, I think, be found necessary when we come to Committee. For instance, the first part of sub-clause (5) does not seem to be required, and the paragraph might begin with the words "The power" in line nine. The second paragraph of sub-clause (5) does not seem to be exactly a proviso, and the words "Provided that" might be omitted. But, as I have said, the Government have no intention of offering any opposition to the Bill; on the contrary; they support it.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE ARMY.</title>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00626"><sup>*</sup><member>THE. DUKE OF BEDFORD</member> rose to call attention to the statement of the Under-Secretary of State for War on 6th March, 1911&#x2014;
<quote>That the total number of Regular Infantry officers required for the six Divisions of the Expeditionary Force is 2,461, exclusive of those required for Staff appointments.</quote>
<quote>That the number of Regular Infantry officers serving at home in the 82 battalions, and who were by the January Army List of 1911 not seconded, was 1,998.</quote>
<quote>That the number of Infantry officers required for the four battalions remaining at home after the departure of the Expeditionary Force is 112.</quote>
<quote>That these figures show a deficiency of 575 Regular Infantry officers, exclusive of Staff and of any allowance for temporary unfitness;</quote>
and to ask the Secretary of State for War how the deficiency of 575 Regular Infantry officers for the six Divisions of the Expeditionary Force will be made good on mobilisation.</p>
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0183"/>
<col>315</col>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00627">The noble Duke said: These figures are now a year old, but there is no appreciable variation. I have referred to the Army List of last January and find that the number of Regular Infantry officers serving at home and not seconded is almost the same. There are still six Divisions in the Expeditionary Force, so that the demands made upon that number remain unaltered. I therefore use precisely the same table of figures as that given to me by the Under-Secretary of State for War on March 6, 1011. It is to the deficiency in the numbers of Regular Infantry officers trained with their battalions for the requirements of the Expeditionary Force to which I beg to draw attention. The War Office figures show a shortage of 463 Regular Infantry officers, and to this number must be added 112 officers required for the four home battalions, as mentioned by the Under-Secretary of State for War, making the total deficit 575 for the Expeditionary Force. This number must be an underestimate. No allowance is made for temporary unfitness for active service. If such unfitness amounted to but one per cent. of the 2,500 officers, the deficiency would be more than 600. Again, a number of company officers&#x2014;I cannot give the exact figures&#x2014;must be employed on mobilisation as Brigade Majors, as Brigade Signalling Officers, as A.D.Cs., and on other extra regimental duties, thereby creating vacancies in their battalions. In short, the deficiency of Regular Infantry officers on mobilisation for the requirements of the Expeditionary Force, as shown by War Office figures, must be well over 600.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00628">I should explain that this large deficiency in Regular Infantry officers arises in great measure from the fact that the noble Viscount has not got Regular Cavalry sufficient for his Expeditionary Force, and consequently is compelled to employ Regular Mounted Infantry to act as Divisional Cavalry&#x2014;that is in place of the Cavalry attached to an Infantry Division. The noble Viscount is compelled to deplete his Infantry battalions of both officers and men in order to create makeshift Divisional Cavalry. On the average the 78 battalions of the Infantry of the Expeditionary Force will find themselves 6 Regular officers short on mobilisation&#x2014;that is a deficiency of one-quarter of the total complement of company officers per battalion. The noble Viscount, in dealing with the
<col>316</col>
Army Estimates on March 14 of last year, said&#x2014;
<quote>"There is no difficulty at all in mobilising as far as officers of the Expeditionary Force are concerned. But, of course, you would deplete to a very considerable extent the depots and the home estublishment."</quote>
But when we come to go into details and take the Infantry arm by itself we find, by figures supplied by the Under-Secretary of State for War, a deficiency of at least 600 Regular Infantry officers. I am anxious to learn from the noble Viscount himself how&#x2014; mean from what sources&#x2014;he proposes to supply the deficiency of 600 Regular Infantry officers as shown by the figures given last year by the Under-Secretary.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00629"><sup>*</sup><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: The figures given by the noble Duke are substantially accurate. They are a little old, but the figures to-day, as he stated, are not materially different from those at the date he takes. The question which he asks is, in substance, this&#x2014;How on mobilisation is the deficiency of officers, which, of course, will exist, to be made up? The peace establishment of officers is different from the war establishment. That state of things is true, not only in the British Army but in every Army, anti I think it always has been true of every army which has moved from a peace to a war footing at all times. Napoleon filled up his deficiency from non-commissioned officers, and, of course, if you do that you can do easily what is required. In the Peninsular War we had to make up a deficiency of officers on mobilisation, and we promoted a large number of non-commissioned officers in those days. In the South African War so many people came forward from all sources that it was not necessary to promote noncommissioned officers to fill up the deficiency, but that source always remains.<lb/>
What I propose to do is to answer the noble Duke now for the moment apart from that source of supply, which is one that we undoubtedly should reserve to ourselves full liberty to resort to, getting as we should some extremely competent company officers from those who had passed through the ranks and had become noncommissioned officers. The Infantry officers in the General Reserve of Officers&#x2014;which the noble Duke, of course, has not
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0184"/>
<col>317</col>
taken into account, because that exists only for mobilisation&#x2014;number at present 791, after allowing 40 per cent. for officers who for various reasons may not be forthcoming. That figure by itself would wipe out his 575. But then ho would say, and say truly, that a number of these officers are of rather senior rank, of rank senior to the subaltern officers who would be required, and therefore you must not treat the whole of them as if they were readily available. But after deducting 40 per cent. there are 791 there. We are taking steps to increase this number by offering General Reserve commissions to ex-cadets of the Officers Training Corps. We have the more encouragement to do this because those who take commissions from the Officers Training Corps are now beginning to come in fairly fast. Already not far off 300 of the cadets of that corps have taken commissions in the Special Reserve&#x2014;a very great change from the state of things eighteen months ago. The Infantry officers in the Special Reserve number 1,540 of all ranks, and allowance has been made in their establishment to admit of four subalterns per battalion passing to the Regulars on mobilisation. There are, outside those referred to in the noble Duke's question, 780 Regular Infantry officers with the Special Reserve battalions. These are the Infantry officers who were posted to those battalions to look after the training at the depot. If an order to mobilise were given, we should certainly take the course which we have always taken before of giving commissions to members of the senior class of Sandhurst, and that will probably provide between 100 and 200 Infantry officers. These sources, taken by themselves, will give enough to provide for mobilisation, but we still have behind that the possibility&#x2014;a very practical one&#x2014;of resorting to the class of non-commissioned officers; and, further, we have what proved to be a great resource in the South African War&#x2014;I refer to the number of people who came forward without being under any obligation to do so, and many of whom rendered very useful service.<lb/>
There is no difficulty in mobilising the Expeditionary Force. I admit that to do so we should have, in the first instance, to draw very heavily upon the Regular officers who may be left, but their places would be filled up from the General Reserve and from the other sources of which I have spoken, and there will also be a good provision for wastage. Mobilisation so far as officers are
<col>318</col>
concerned is a ragged business in all armies. It is true that Germany is better off in this direction because of the system under which it gets the one-year trained officers who have gone on to the Reserve. Germany can use Reserve officers freely, but I think that is the only country which can put its hand on the exact number of officers required on mobilisation. In other countries you have to draw upon other classes. I will give the figures of the cadets of the Officers Training Corps who have taken commissions in the Special Reserve. Virtually the Officers Traning Corps had not become operative for this purpose until the end of 1908, but between July 1 of that year and March 31, 1911, 128 came forward and took commissions; between March 31, 1911, and July 1, 1911, 52 more had come in; and between July of last year and February 29 of this year 103 more had come in; so that 283 in all have taken commissions in the Special Reserve. Besides that there are a large number&#x2014;well on to 500&#x2014;who have taken A and B certificates and who have left the corps but who are on our list, many of whom will come forward in time of emergency although they do not want to train specially in the Special Reserve. The exact number of Infantry officers serving at home on January 1, 1912, was 2,788, which is rather more than the figure in the return quoted by the noble Duke. Though, as I have said, mobilisation is always a troublesome business, as regards officers we are better off than, so far as I know, we have ever been before; and behind all that we have the power of resorting to that most valuable class of non-commissioned officers on whom we have drawn in the past, and on whom we can draw, and no doubt always shall draw, if emergency requires it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00630"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member><membercontribution>: The noble Viscount mentioned the fact that all armies need expansion on mobilisation, but that fact will not supply us with 600 Regular Infantry officers. Then the noble Viscount relies on the Reserve of Officers. I see by the Army List that more than half of these are Lieutenant-Colonels and Majors&#x2014; that is, Field Officers. Then there are many senior captains who have retired from the Army years ago and are now no longer young. These Field Officers and senior captains are elderly warriors who have been on the shelf for some years and are impossible for company duties. Of the remainder
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0185"/>
<col>319</col>
many are now serving in the Yeomanry, in the Special Reserve, and in the Territorial Army. Others are seconded for service abroad. Others, again, are ex-Militia and ex-Volunteer officers who have passed to the Reserve on the abolition of these forces by the noble Viscount. These are not liable for foreign service.<lb/>
Then the noble Viscount comes to the officers of the Special Reserve, which includes officers from the Officers Training Corps. By the Return of February 27, 1911, of Special Reserve subalterns, the number ought to be 1,915 but it is nothing of the kind, because the Return shows a shortage of 1,267. The number actually serving is given by the Return as 648. The January Army List shows no appreciable variation. By the Army Order of December 23, 1907, each Special Reserve battalion must send one subaltern to the depot on mobilisation. This means the withdrawal of 74 Special Reserve subalterns from their battalions for depot duties, leaving available 574. But 600 officers are required&#x2014;result, a deficit of 26 and no Special Reserve subaltern left in any one of the Special Reserve battalions. As a source of supply the Special Reserve is insufficient, even if you chose to take every single subaltern away from the Force.<lb/>
I have mentioned Special Reserve subalterns because to employ Special Reserve captains with the battalions of the Expeditionary Force would be not only most detrimental to the efficiency of the Army but grossly unfair to the Line officers. The Special Reserve officer is to rank on joining the Line as the junior of his rank&#x2014;that is to say, a Special Reserve major would rank above the senior captain in a Line regiment, a Special Reserve captain above the senior Lieutenant in a Line regiment. In the latter case the senior subaltern in the Line will be deprived of the promotion which is due to him and for which he has qualified. That is hard lines on him. The Service will suffer by the supersession of a professional soldier by an amateur who has not served as many months continuously as the man over whose head he goes has served years.<lb/>
Some substitutes for the Regular officers deficient from the Expeditionary Force
<col>320</col>
may be obtained, but not in sufficient quantity. Now as to their quality&#x2014;I mean their value as officers of the First Line. No one would deny that it is quite impossible to make good to our Regular Infantry on the very eve of battle the lack of 600 Regular officers who ought, under any proper war organisation, to have been trained continuously with their companies. Sir John French, commenting on the Infantry training in 1909, stated that&#x2014;
<quote>"The absence of officers during company training when employed on signalling and mounted infantry duties was most injurious to efficiency."</quote>
But the noble Viscount proposes to supply the Infantry of the Expeditionary Force with 600 non-Regular officers, strangers alike to their regiments as well as to their duties, without any knowledge of the interior economy of a battalion and absolutely- ignorant of what the discipline of the Regular Army means. By the plan of the noble Viscount 600 non-Regular officers are assumed within three weeks or less of joining the Infantry of the Expeditionary Force to be capable of commanding a company in a decisive battle on the Continent. Now this is to assume an absurdity. I know it will be said that of course such non-Regular officers will only be employed as junior subalterns and that they will certainly not be put in any place of responsibility. That may be; but we are dealing with war and not peace conditions, and a junior subaltern may find himself commanding his company within twenty minutes of going into his first battle. Does the noble Viscount really suppose that the serving-non-commissioned officers and men of a Regular battalion would have any confidence in the leading of an officer just conic from some non-Regular contingent, about whom they know nothing save that he is obviously incompetent? In no concern outside our Regular Army as at present organised by the noble Viscount would experienced men and foremen who know their work well be expected to take their orders at a moment of supreme crisis from a boy who knows nothing at all about the business.<lb/>
During the South African war, officers of the Regular Army were continually reproached, and most unjustly, with a lack of professional knowledge. Now it seems that the moment you go outside the Regular Army it is impossible to find a
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0186"/>
<col>321</col>
boy, though he has scarcely studied soldiering except as a pastime, who is not fit straight away to command a company of Regular Infantry in a general action. We spend millions a year on the training of the Regular Army and its officers because we say that training is essential, and then we send the Infantry battalions of our. Expeditionary Force into action with 600 non-Regular and untrained company officers, if they can be obtained, and even that is doubtful. Moreover, we are expected to accept them as of just the same value and as perfect substitutes for Regular officers. If that is not the organisation of defeat I know not what is.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00631"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: The noble Viscount has told us that a certain number of the officers to go abroad will be those trained in the Officers Training Corps. As the noble Duke said, 600 of them will be officers of the Special Reserve. Would the noble Viscount tell the House whether there is any limit within which officers of the Special Reserve may attain the rank of: captain, or, rather, whether there is any limit before which they may not attain the rank of captain; also what would be the minimum service in the Special Reserve which would enable a man to go abroad as a captain commanding subalterns in the Regular Army?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00632"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: The question of the noble Viscount has arisen, I think, through my not having made myself clear. There is no deficiency in the peace establishment of Regular officers for the Expeditionary Force at the present time. The deficiency arises on mobilisation, and you would make that up by sending the best officers you could get. You would not, at any rate to any large extent, take officers from the Officers Training Corps of the Special Reserve for that purpose. What you would do would be to draw upon the Regular officers belonging to the other establishments at home. There are 780 of them with the Special Reserve battalions. You would make your Expeditionary Force as perfect in officers as possible. For stationary work, such as training and so on, you would get a certain number of older officers from the General Reserve of officers, of whom there are 791 available after allowing 40 per cent. for those who would not come up. Then for the rest you would put officers who had
<col>322</col>
gone through the Officers Training Corps and taken commissions in the Special Reserve. Some of those who are not attached to battalions but are on what is called the unattached lis&#x2014;that is to say, they have been trained with Regular battalions at times of the year which suited them, and they have got their promotion and their commissions in the Special Reserve though not attached to the battalions. You have in that way a reservoir to draw on of those officers for Special Reserve work. There are already some 283 of them; and besides there are nearly 500 who have taken their certificates and are, therefore, to a certain extent trained, many of whom would be ready to come up in time of war, though they have not taken commissions, and would be available.<lb/>
The effect of that would be that you would put the cream of what you had available into the Expeditionary Force. You would fill up according to the necessities, using the best men for the more important places and using your less trained men for the less important places; and where there is a shortage we intend to make use of some of these highly trained non-commissioned officers in whom the Army of this country excels. There is no doubt our non-commissioned officers, what ever our deficiencies are, are very good indeed, and many of them are admirably fitted to be promoted. The substance of the whole thing is that mobilisation is always rather a ragged business and would be so with us, but not more ragged with us than it is with other countries except Germany&#x2014;which, as I have said, has an admirable system of Reserve officers&#x2014;and certainly much less ragged than it used to be in the old wars which we managed successfully and in which we relied entirely on promoting non-commissioned officers. The Army Council has been at work hard on this problem for eighteen months past, and we are satisfied that we can mobilise and supply wastage. This answer is subject to the reservation that there is that amount of raggedness which I admit arises on the figures and organisation which I have given, and which is not peculiar to the army of this country; it applies to the army of almost every other country, and is due to the fact that there is a difference between peace establishment and war establishment. I have stated to the House the way in which the difference is to be made up.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00633"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: The answer of the noble Viscount, then, amounts to this, does it not? That in order to supply the gap in the Regular Army it will be necessary to do by the Special Reserve just what was done by the old Militia with regard to men, and to take some of the best of the officers in order to fill up the gap in the Line.</membercontribution></p>

But the battalions of the Special Reserve from which they will be taken will be the 74 battalions which do not go abroad. They will be the 74 battalions at the depots whose function is largely that of training, though they do defence work. It is not like taking them from a unit which is going abroad.</membercontribution></p>

<title>OVER-INSURANCE OF SHIPS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00635"><member>LORD ELLENBOROUGH</member> rose to call attention to some of the Reports of Courts of Inquiry into the causes of the loss of ships insured above their value, and to ask the Government whether they will order the Reports of the Courts of Inquiry into the causes of the loss of the "Carnedd Llewellyn," "Oxus," "Cadoxton," "Idle-wild," "Kingswell," "Gunford," "George," "Ouse," " Selworthy," "Cardiff Hall," "Hasland," "Everest," "British Standard," and "Dunsley," the judgments of the Admiralty Courts in the cases of the appeal of the owners of the "Idlewild," and of Paul Braun, who had been master of the " British Standard," and the judgment of the House of Lords in the case of the "Gunford," to be laid before the House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00636">The noble Lord said: My Lords, the evils of which I am about to complain have, I think, been in existence since the time of Queen Elizabeth. There are traces of them in the "Merchant of Venice." What was Shylock thinking of when he used the words&#x2014;
<quote>"Ships are but boards, sailors but men: there be land-rats and water-rats."</quote>
Had he said this in the nineteenth century or in the early part of the twentieth century I should have thought that he was thinking of taking out P.P.I. policies on Antonio's ships and then arranging for their destruction. I am about to call your Lordships' attention to the proceedings of some modern two-legged rats. That they
<col>324</col>
existed in the time of George II is shown by the Preamble of an Act of Parliament passed in 1746, which states that&#x2014;
<quote>"It has been found by experience that there are in existence many pernicious practices whereby great numbers of ships, with their cargoes, have been either fraudulently lost and destroyed, or taken by the enemy in time of war."</quote>
And that&#x2014;
<quote>"By introducing a mischievous kind of gaming or wagering, wider the pretence of assuring the risk on shipping and fair trade, the institution and laudable design of making assurances hath been perverted, and that which was intended for the encouragement of trade and navigation has in many instances become hurtful and destructive to the same."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00637">There is, therefore, nothing new about the crimes to which I am about to refer, but the methods of perpetrating them have been greatly improved upon.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00638">My attention was first called to this class of fraud by a case that occurred when I was in Bombay in 1870. Two English shipbrokers, who were well connected and personally known to many of my friends in Bombay, made a pretence of loading with cotton a vessel called the " Aurora." which lay at anchor close to my ship. Bills of lading were signed in advance for cotton that had not been put on board, and money was raised on the security of these bills of lading. As it was clear that if the "Aurora" reached England the fraud would be detected, the two ship brokers agreed to pay the captain&#x00A3;1,500 and the carpenter&#x00A3;600 on condition of their sinking the ship. The "Aurora " left Bombay on April 11, and was set on fire by the carpenter on the 12th. The captain made no attempt to extinguish the fire, but got a boat out at once. The sea was calm. On the return of the crew to Bombay suspicions were aroused which resulted in a trial that caused a great sensation in that city. Eventually all four culprits confessed their guilt. The carpenter was sentenced to ten years' penal servitude, and the captain to fifteen, the chief conspirators, the two shipbrokers, receiving life sentences. Compared with present-day practitioners, who have raised barratry to a fine art and who manage to avoid punishment for their crimes, these men were mere bunglers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00639">Take the case of the "Selworthy." At about 5 pm. on March 17, 1910, when about eighty miles from the Canaries, a violent explosion took place in her after
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0188"/>
<col>325</col>
hold and a column of water rushed into the ship. The sea was calm. The crew took to the boats. After drifting about for about forty-three hours they were picked up and landed at Genoa, whence they travelled to Cardiff. Major Cooper-Key, His Majesty's inspector of Explosives, held art inquiry at Cardiff. and came to the conclusion that the explosion was due to a charge of high explosive, such as dynamite, which had been deposited in No. 4 hold, and that in his opinion the explosive could only have been so placed and fixed by a member or members of the ship's company. Now comes the question, Who was likely to profit by the crime that was committed? The managing owner gave evidence that the ship cost&#x00A3;8,000 in June, 1909, of which about two-thirds were left on mortgage. The total of the insurance amounted to&#x00A3;15,750. Major Cooper-Key, while acquitting the owners of any attempt to over-insure by misrepresentation, stated that the fact undoubtedly remained that the total loss of the vessel would be very profitable to them. Now in the case of the "Selworthy" it is evident that a crime was committed and that more than one person had a hand in it. Yet it was so skilfully planned that there was not enough evidence to convict any one.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00640">I now come to the case of the "British Standard," of which most of your Lordships have probably heard, because it has been well reported by the Press. She was owned by Brown, Son and Company, who occasionally called themselves by other names, thus leading to confusion. They had previously lost the "Albion" and the "Duffryn Manor." The "Albion" was lost in May, 1908. The total insurances were&#x00A3;32,000, including disbursements, freight, &amp;c. The outside value of the vessel was&#x00A3;16,500, exclusive of disbursements, freight, &amp;c., the value of which is not stated in the report. Also, in addition to the above there were P.P.I. policies for&#x00A3;12,600. So that she was worth a great deal more at the bottom of the sea than on its surface. The cause of her loss was said to be that her steam steering gear jammed at the entrance to the harbour of Corcubion. The Court did not blame any one, but expressed a strong opinion on P.P.I. policies. The "Duffryn Manor" was wrecked on an island off the coast of Ceylon in May, 1909. An inqury was held at Colombo. The Court said"&#x2014;
<quote>"An attempt was made by one of the witnesses called at the Inquiry to prove that the ship bad been deliberately wrecked."</quote>
<col>326</col>
The Court did not accept this view, but, strange to say, their report did not touch on the all-important question of insurance. Mr. Brown originally intended to appoint Captain Vigers, who had lost the "Duffryn Manor," as master of the "British Standard," but as the underwriters objected the agreement with him was cancelled. The firm of Brown, Son &amp; Company, consisting of Frederick Brown and his son Thomas, contracted to purchase a steamer at a cost of&#x00A3;32,500. As they had not got enough money to pay for her,&#x00A3;26,500 was left on mortgage to be paid off by instalments in four years' time. Their previous losses made it difficult for the owners to insure the "British Standard" at normal prices, but eventually an insurance was effected for&#x00A3;32,000 on hull and machinery, at eight guineas per cent.&#x2014;two guineas above the average. Further insurances were effected which brought the amount up to&#x00A3;55,300, though, according to the owners' statements, the value at risk was only&#x00A3;46,378, so that&#x00A3;8,900 was to be gained if she went to the bottom.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00641">The financial arrangements connected with this ship were exceedingly complicated. Frederick Brown was of German origin and was born in Heligoland. His brother Paul was a naturalised British subject and had originally been a German. Messrs. Brown on March 13 described Captain Paul Braun as a man with a long experience and a clean record. One of the underwriters objected to this statement, saying that Captain Braun had got the "Haxby" and the "Glenroy" on shore, and had had a collision when in charge of the "Lexington." At the inquiry it came out that Captain Braun had lost the "Frankfort" many years previously, and that his certificate had been suspended six months for losing the "Rook." The crew of the "British Standard" consisted of twenty-six men, belonging to fifteen different countries. At the trial evidence was taken through interpreters of Greek, Arabic, Italian, and also of Pigeon English for seine of the coloured men. One wonders what has become of the language test that was recently made compulsory in British ships! On May 25, 1911, when about fifteen miles from Cape Negro, not far from Rio Janeiro, the captain and some of the crew declared that she struck something. Others heard and felt nothing. The Court was of the
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0189"/>
<col>327</col>
opinion that the "British Standard" did not strike either a derelict, or submerged wreckage, or a rock, and gave reasons for this opinion that appear to me to be conclusive. No attempt was made to save the ship, either by using pumps or by closing watertight doors. Boats were ordered out at once. The Court said&#x2014;
<quote>"If the master had promptly taken the measures available to keep the water out, the Court is of opinion that, whatever the cause of the water may have been, there is a strong probability that she would have been saved. The conduct and the omissions of the master and the chief engineer to make some effort to save the vessel indicate an absence of desire to save her."</quote>
They also stated that the evidence clearly established that she was prematurely abandoned. The Court also said that the master offered money to the second officer in order to induce him to support the master's story as to the loss of the vessel. Not being a criminal Court, it could only deal with the Master and chief engineer by fining them and suspending their certificates. The chief engineer's certificate was suspended for twelve months, and that of the captain for eighteen months. The former was fined fifty guineas; the latter 1,000 guineas.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00642">Captain Paul Braun appealed against this decision to the Admiralty Court. According to <i>The Times</i> of February 8, the Admiralty Court stated that the conclusion was not unreasonable that the master was not sorry that the vessel was likely to sink if all efforts to keep her afloat were avoided, and that this attitude of mind was induced by the existence of the various insurances detailed in the report. The Admiralty Court found that the Court below was fully justified in finding that the ship was abandoned by the wrongful act and default of the master and in suspending his certificate. But, for technical reasons, the Admiralty Court reduced the 1,000 guineas that he had been ordered to pay towards the expenses of the trial to&#x00A3;350. At the Court of Inquiry at Cardiff, after passing sentence in the case of the "British Standard," Mr. Lewis said&#x2014;
<quote>"Being of opinion that grave malpractices arise from, or are connected with, the over-insurance of vessels, I repeat, with the full concurrence of the able and experienced gentlemen who assist me, the observations that I made at this Court at a previous Inquiry. Over-insurance is not exclusively a private matter between insurers and insured. There are other parties affected whose interests are not protected and whose lives may be endangered
<col>328</col>
&#x2014;<i>i.e</i>., the members of the crew. Where a vessel is over-insured, one of the most powerful incentives for keeping her in good condition and seaworthiness is removed, and over-insurance also offers a dangerous temptation to persons and agents of persons who will gain by the loss of the vessel; whether lost through negligence, unseaworthiness, or foul play, the lives of the crew are imperilled. The effectual prevention of an unnecessary peril to seafaring men is worthy the attention of the Legislature."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00643">Mr. Lewis, the Judge, then quoted from the Courts of Inquiry into the cases of nine over-insured ships lost under suspicious circumstances.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00644">The " Guilford " had paid no dividends for seven years. The total of her insurances was&#x00A3;35,000, of which&#x00A3;6,500 were P.P.I. policies on the personal account of the managing owner. The Court found the value of the vessel to be&#x00A3;9,000 and of the freight&#x00A3;5,000. The managing owner, Mr. Briggs, appointed a man named Sember, who was originally a German, to command this ship. His chief qualification appears to have been that he had been ashore ever since his certificate had been suspended for the loss of the "Perthshire" twenty-two years previously, and that he might, therefore, have been expected to have forgotten how to navigate. Sember ran the ship on shore on three different shoals near the South American coast on three different days, and eventually lost her. Ten of her crew of twenty-six died in consequence of having been landed at an unhealthy place, after exposure. The managing owner said that he did not know of Sember's record. If what he said was true, it was culpable negligence on his part, negligence which was the indirect cause of the loss of ten lives. It was a duty that the owner owed to the crew to have known more about Captain Sember. There has been litigation as to whether the underwriters should pay the insurances in the case of the "Gunford." As that litigation reached this House, I think it would be presumptuous on my part to comment on it in the presence of noble and learned Lords who know so much snore about that part of the matter than I do. I have no sympathy with either of the litigants. All that I have to spare is expended on the ten men, who would not have lost their lives had their ship not been wrecked by an incompetent captain.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00645">I now wish to call attention to the "Rowe" Steamship Company. This company had paid no dividend since its formation in May, 1905. On May 31, 1910,
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0190"/>
<col>329</col>
this company owned four vessels. It had the misfortune to lose two vessels on two consecutive days&#x2014;the "Hasland" on March 29, and the "Everest" on March 30, 1911. As both vessels were over-insured the shareholders are much to be congratulated on their good fortune. The "Dunsley," over-insured to the extent of&#x00A3;9,800, was lost on August 30, 1911, off Bardsley Lighthouse, on her way from Appledore to Birkenhead. The Court of Inquiry was held at Cardiff and presided over by Mr. Lewis. I had intended to say a great deal about the "Dunsley" but as Mr. Buxton recently stated in another place that an application had been made for a re-hearing of the case, I shall only mention the sentence of that Court, which was that the master's certificate be suspended for twelve months; that Mr. Shotton, the superintending engineer, should pay&#x00A3;50; Edwards, the engineer,&#x00A3;100; and the managing owner, Mr. Hannibal Thomas, of Cardiff, was ordered to pay&#x00A3;1,500 towards the expenses of the Inquiry, which had lasted for twenty-one days. There is, of course, great difficulty in obtaining evidence at these Courts of Inquiry, as they are like inquests without a postmortem; but if in cases like the "Selworthy" and the "British Standard" convictions are unattainable, the law certainly requires alteration.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00646">If a modification of the two clauses in Mr. Chamberlain's Bill relating to over-insurance had become law in 1884, the position of the owners of these ships would have been very different, as the over-insurance would have been forfeited to the Crown and the shareholders would have made no profit at all. Secondly, the underwriters would have been fined treble the premiums received by them. Another remedy would be to extend the scope of the jurisdiction of the Courts of Inquiry. They have at present the power to prevent a master mariner from exercising his pro-session by suspending his certificate. When a ship is lost in consequence of the misconduct or false economy of an owner, the Court might be given power to make him abandon his profession by ordering him to sell all his property in shipping within three months under penalty of its being forfeited to the Crown. Or sea insurance might be put on the same footing as fire insurance, which disallows claims above the actual value of the losses incurred. The reason why underwriters often insist on a
<col>330</col>
high insurance is that old ships are now more liable to accidents than new ones, and that policies are free from particular average up to 3 per cent. Thus, if a ship is insured for&#x00A3;10,000, all average above&#x00A3;300 is paid by the underwriter, whereas if she is insured for'&#x00A3;20,000 the underwriter does not pay until it amounts to&#x00A3;600. In his speech in 1884 Mr. Chamberlain said that partial losses were to total losses as 20 to 1. I do not know what the present proportion may be. It has been suggested that underwriters and shipowners should agree to insure on the basis of full declared value on ordinary claims when dealing with old and worn-out ships, but only to insure up to 50 or 75 per cent. of that value for purposes of total loss. On the whole, however, I think it would be better to scrap such ships.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00647">In proportion to our commerce, I believe that there are very few criminal cases similar to the "British Standard" and the "Selworthy," but there are, unfortunately, a much larger number of ships owned by men who, though taking no illegal steps, are indifferent as to whether their ships sink or float, who save too much money on repairs, and who over-insure crazy ships that ought to be scrapped. The latter class of owner is really the more mischievous. For instance, take the case of the "Carnedd Llewellyn," insured for nearly double her value and lost with all hands; whereas in cases like the "Selworthy" and the "British Standard" those on board take care that so-called accidents shall only take place in fine weather, with a minimum of risk to captain and crew. It may be urged that the number of ship-owners of this class is comparatively small, and that therefore legislation is unnecessary. I do not agree with this. There are other crimes that are seldom committed, but yet there are laws to check them. The loss of over-insured ships must fall on some one. As most underwriters flourish, they must get recouped for their losses by putting higher premiums on honestly run ships, so that the honest ship-owner has eventually to pay for the frauds of the dishonest wrecker. As long as the law imposes no check on the purchase of crazy and worn-out ships by single ship companies run by men of straw as managing owners, there will be some ships that are run dishonestly.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00648">One of these men of straw, the owner of the "Queen Olga," recently swindled four
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0191"/>
<col>331</col>
master mariners into giving him&#x00A3;600 apiece for the privilege of commanding that ship. As, however, the ship herself was seized by mortgagees, their hard-earned savings disappeared. The former owner of that ship was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment, but there is nothing to prevent him from resuming his profession of ship-owner when he comes out of gaol. Ship-owners may possibly object to the proposed extension of the powers of the Courts of Inquiry. I therefore suggest as an alternative that they be empowered to deal with malpractices themselves, through the instrumentality of a committee elected by ship-owners and shipping companies, with votes in proportion to the tonnage that they own. Such a committee should have power conferred upon it by Act of Parliament to order any shareholder or owner found guilty of misconduct to dispose of all his shares and property in shipping within three months, under penalty of forfeiture to the Crown. Magistrates and Law Courts should have power to refer such cases as the "Selworthy," "British Standard," and "Queen Olga," to this committee, much in the same way that they call the attention of the Law Society to the conduct of solicitors. Barristers can be disbarred, solicitors can be struck off the Rolls, medical men can be interfered with by what are practically committees elected by their own profession, and I think that similar powers might with advantage be entrusted to ship-owners, who would then be able to get rid of the black sheep who disgrace their calling. My object in asking that these Reports should be laid before the House is to put in an accessible form the case for changes, either in the law or in the customs prevailing between owners and underwriters, changes which would put an end to what has been a disgrace to Great Britain for a period extending from the reign of George II to that of George V.</p>
<col>332</col>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00649"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF GRANARD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Board of Trade will be very pleased to grant the Return asked for by my noble friend, and it may be of interest if I state in a few words what has been the effect of the measure passed in 1909 with regard to the insurance of ships. Undoubtedly before that time there was a great deal of abuse in connection with the insurance of ships by persons who had no interest whatever in them, but since that has been made a criminal act it is believed that there has been very little insurance of this kind. As your Lordships are aware, under the Act of 1909 there is no attempt made to deal with over-insurance of vessels by owners themselves, but this question has been considered on several occasions by the Board of Trade, and even as lately as last year the Board wrote to four underwriting bodies asking them for their observations with regard to the "Gunford" judgment and the over-valuation of vessels for insurance. The replies sent to the Board of Trade were to the effect that more time was required to estimate the effect of the "Gunford" judgment. They also thought that underwriters should have a free hand as regards the valuation of vessels. The Board, in view of these replies from the different underwriters, were of opinion that at the present moment it would not be well to bring in any legislation. It may be pointed out that in none of the cases that have come before a Court of Inquiry has it been found that loss of life has been caused as a result of over-insurance. The reports of the different inquiries to which the noble Lord refers will be published and laid on the Table in, I hope, a couple of days.</membercontribution></p>

This Amendment is intended to modify the Bill, which, as it
<col>334</col>
stands, would apply to all factories where men only are employed certain provisions involving in many cases structural alterations, and it is only right that where new conditions are imposed on the carrying on of an industry a reasonable amount of time should be given to those occupying the factories to adapt themselves to the new conditions. I am glad to see that the noble Lord in charge of the Bill has met this point to a great extent in the Amendment which he has placed on the Paper, and which is in these terms&#x2014;
<quote>Clause 1, page 1, line 8, after ("repealed") insert ("Provided that where a person was immediately before the passing of this Act exempt front such provisions as aforesaid in respect of any premises he shall not be convicted of any contravention of or failure to comply with any of those provisions which takes place before the first day of November nineteen hundred and twelve if he proves that in order to comply therewith structural alterations of those premises were necessary").</quote>
But the noble Lord's Amendment throws the burden of proof on the occupier of the premises, which I think is contrary to the ordinary rule of law and rather hard on our industries. But the real point is that the words "structural alterations" in the noble Lord's Amendment are somewhat vague. The occupier is given a statutory defence limited to his proving that structural alterations were necessary. That defence, it seems to me, would not apply to such alterations as the provision of expensive appliances for procuring internal ventilation. In that case it would rest on the occupier to show that structural alterations were really required. If the requirements of the Bill could be met by the provision of, say, very costly appliances, his defence would fall to the ground. I would ask the noble Lord to consider whether the words "structural alterations" are not somewhat vague, and whether he could not meet the point I have put forward.<lb/>

The noble Marquess pointed out that unless a certain amount of time were given to owners of workshops the Bill would press rather hardly upon them, and I have put down an Amendment which I think meets the case stated by the noble Marquess. I admit that the point between us is not a large one, but I prefer my Amendment to the noble Earl's, and seeing that this is a Government Bill and that there is really so little between us I would be glad if the noble Earl would allow my Amendment to go in instead of his. I do not think the point he raises about the words "structural alterations" is an important one. It seems to me clear that any occupier of a workshop would be able to demonstrate quite easily that certain time was required for making the alterations, and there would be no difficulty whatever in his proving it. I hope, therefore, that the noble Earl will allow my Amendment to stand as it is.</membercontribution></p>

It is quite clear that the Government's Amendment narrows the effect of the provision very considerably. My noble friend behind me proposes that the Bill as a whole should not come into operation until after a reasonable amount of notice has been given. The Government proposal is that adequate notice should be given only in respect of alterations which can be described as structural, and not in respect of other alterations of the premises.

<title>THE GOVERNMENT'S LAND POLICY.</title>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00669"><member>THE DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH</member> rose to call attention to the Report of the Departmental Committee appointed by the Board of Agriculture to inquire into the position of tenant farmers, and to ask what action His Majesty's Government propose to take in relation thereto.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00670">The noble Duke said: My Lords, I desire to draw your attention to the Report of the Departmental Committee appointed by the late President of the Board of Agriculture. This Report has been in the hands of your Lordships for about a month. The Committee which issued this Report was composed of very distinguished individuals. There were upon the Committee members of this House and some members of the other House, all individuals whose practical knowledge and experience entitle them to express an opinion on agricultural problems, and, furthermore, the chairman of the Committee was a distinguished member of your Lordships' House&#x2014;Lord Haversham. Agriculture is one of the most important industries, if not the most important industry, in this country, and knowing full well that there are a great number of noble Lords in this House who take a deep and profound interest in the welfare and prosperity of all those associated with agriculture, I felt that it would not be considered wrong on my part if I brought to your Lordships' notice at this early stage of the session this very interesting and comprehensive Report.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00671">The Report itself is of a somewhat complicated character, partly because land tenure in itself is complicated, and, furthermore, because land tenure is complicated owing to the recent legislation which His Majesty's Government have, if I may use the phrase, inflicted upon us during the last six or seven years. We have had the Agricultural Holdings Act, we have had the Small Holdings Act, we have had the Housing and Town Planning Act brought in and passed by Mr. Burns, and last, but by no means least, we have had the land clauses in the Budget of 1909. The Report to which I am calling attention is at once very limited and also a very far-reaching document. It is limited to this extent, that the Committee were appointed to consider the position of tenant farmers. Now the position of tenant farmers has been more or less defined and consolidated by the Agricultural Holdings Act of 1908, and the
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0194"/>
<col>337</col>
Report contains some specific recommendations which would amend that Act&#x2014;recommendations on which I shall have a word to say later on. The Agricultural Holdings Act of 1908 consolidated what I might call the position between the permanent landlord and the permanent tenant. But the Committee were instructed to go a bit further. They were instructed to report on the questions arising out of changes in ownership, These changes the Committee found to be very numerous indeed. On Page 5 of their Report the Committee say that in the year 1911 the value of agricultural land which exchanged hands exceeded &#x00A3;2,000,000. This fact, of course, promptly raised in the minds of the Committee two definite, broad, comprehensive points. In the first place, the Committee asked themselves, Why had these changes taken place? and, secondly, What would be the result of them, and would, indeed, tenant farmers exist in the future any more? So we get really, in perusing this Report, into rather a paradoxical position. For while, as far as I can gather, the Committee seem generally anxious to adhere to and remain within the Reference to which they were invited to pay attention, a majority of the members of the Committee at the end of the Report recommended the transformation of tenants into owners by the aid of a State Bank. Therefore in reading the Report you will find, first, an attempt to amend the Agricultural Holdings Act of 1908, and at other times there is an attempt to indicate the future land policy of the country.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00672">Perhaps your Lordships will permit me to take the small points first. The Committee make four recommendations with regard to the position of tenant farmers. Those recommendations are to be found in Paragraphs 26, 27, 30, and 32. These recommendations are made on the assumption of giving longer notices to tenants in various cases; but my concern, and, indeed, so far as I can understand, the concern of the Committee itself, is in the case of the sale of land. As to this let me remind your Lordships what the Committee recommend. The Committee recommend, in the case where a tenant receives notice to quit for the purpose of sale, that the tenant should be empowered to serve a counter-notice claiming that the notice to quit shall not take effect until one year after the original notice would have expired&#x2014;that is to
<col>338</col>
say, in all cases tenants are to have two years' notice instead of one, and that in case of a sale the tenant, by serving what, is called a counter-notice, can claim an extra two years over and above the ordinary year's notice. So, in practice, the tenant in the event of sale is to receive two years' minimum notice, and possibly, under certain conditions, a maximum of three years. The question will at once be raised by noble Lords in this House, Why should a landlord be forced to extend his notices and thus possibly see the selling value of his land considerably reduced?</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00673">For the moment I do not wish to discuss the position of the landlord. I will do that at a little later stage. Let me draw your Lordships' attention to the position of the tenant. My concern for the moment is with the tenant. Do these extended notices, as recommended in this Report, really give what the tenant himself requires? In other words, does he get what he wants? Clearly not. The Report says that what the tenants want is not change of ownership. In Paragraph 10, Page 5, the Committee say that the witnesses before them were practically unanimous in expressing the view that the tenants farming on the large estates of England and Wales desired nothing better than to remain as tenants under their present landlords. In other words, these sales of land, to the value of &#x00A3;2,000,000, are events which are strongly deprecated by the tenants themselves. The recommendation in this Report, instead of gratifying the wish of the tenants &#x2014;that, of course, might not have been possible&#x2014;simply makes tenants uncomfortable for two or three years instead of one year. So much for the position of the tenant.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00674">What about the position of the landlord? Let us for arguments sake take an estate of 40,000 acres. The principle holds good whether the estate is 40,000, 20,000, 10,000, or 5,000 acres. Under the Finance Act of 1909&#x2013;10, at the death of the owner of an estate of 40,000 acres duty has to be paid according to the market price at the time of the death of the owner. Let us assume that his estate is worth &#x00A3;1 an acre, and that it is valued by the Government at twenty-five years' purchase. You at once arrive at the fact that the corpus of the estate amounts to &#x00A3;1,000,000
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0195"/>
<col>339</col>
Under the schedule of the Death Duties the owner of an estate worth &#x00A3;1,000,000 has to contribute to the Exchequer 15 per cent., but in addition to that there is the Succession Duty, which I believe is 2 per cent., and the Settlement Duty, which is 1 per cent., making the full contribution by this estate 18 per cent.&#x2014;in other words, practically one-fifth. If the landlord himself was not insured, if he did not possess any other resources than those in land, this one-fifth of the estate has to be sold in order to meet the liabilities to the Exchequer; and, what is much more serious, one-fifth of the tenants have to be dispossessed or have to submit themselves to having their farms sold to a new landlord. The questions ask at this stage are, What will be the effect of this on the value of the land itself? Surely that is a point which we are entitled to put. Again, Who is likely to purchase this land? Are the tenants likely to purchase it? We know very well that already they have very slender resources, and the Committee in this Report continually say that it would be very unwise for tenants to take the money which they have now got in agriculture and invest it in land. The effect of that would be to reduce the sum total of the money now invested in agriculture and place it in land, and consequently the prolification of the soil would be affected. Are county councils likely to buy it? We know, for reasons which I will refer to later, that they are not.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00675">Then I ask, Is the fact that, in the event of purchase, the prospective owner cannot take possession until two or three years after he has purchased the land an inducement to citizens to embark their capital in agricultural land It used to be the custom for tenants when taking a farm to inquire into the stability of the landlord, into his character and general administrative capacity, but I do not think tenants are any longer going to make this inquiry. They will ask, Is the landlord insured, and, if not, has he any means of paying his liabilities to the State on his decease? For, if he has not, it is clear that part of his estate will have to be sold to meet the obligations to the Government, and the tenants will at once be dispossessed and made uncomfortable. I am bound to add that the Report does nothing to remedy this state of affairs by any suggestions or any
<col>340</col>
proposals. I venture to say this to Lord Haversham, with the most profound respect, that if he had really had the courage to go to the root and bedrock of the matter he would have recommended that the Death Duties should be considerably diminished or abolished altogether.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00676"><member>LORD HAVERSHAM</member><membercontribution>: That was not within the Reference to the Committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00677"><member>THE DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: I bow to the noble Lord's reply. No doubt that is quite correct. But the question of the Death Duties is at the root of the difficulty. At this point the Committee open up a much wider issue. This was the consideration presented. It was said, Supposing the land is sold by one landlord to another and the tenants are given security of tenure for a period of two or three years, what about a public body? What is to happen in the event of a county council buying land? Are the tenants in that case to have an extended tenancy of two or three years or are they not? And the Committee unanimously decided that the tenants should not have an extended tenancy; but they said that instead of the extended tenancy the public body should pay the tenant proper compensation for being dispossessed of his farm. That is fully pointed out in Paragraph 38, on Page 9. This is the point I want to bring to your Lordships' notice&#x2014;How is this recommendation going to affect the tenants of the public body themselves? Who is going to pay this compensation? Are the ratepayers going to pay it Certainly not. Why should they pay it? There is no moral authority or reason for imposing this liability on the ratepayers. Are the small holders themselves going to pay it? Every one knows that the small owner cannot afford to pay compensation to the tenant for being dispossessed. The compensation arrangements recommended in this Report, or as they are set out in the amending Small Holdings Act of 1910, have really helped to render inoperative the original Small Holdings Act of 1906. The policy recommended by this Committee is parallel to that which has vitiated so much the agrarian policy of the noble Marquess, Lord Lincolnshire. The noble Marquess originally gave security of tenure to tenants against landlords, but no security to tenants against public bodies. Now the tenant is safeguarded
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0196"/>
<col>341</col>
both against the landlord and against public bodies, and the burden is thrown on the back of the small holder. The noble Marquess knows perfectly well the overwhelming difficulty the small holder has to find compensation for those who leave a farm for him to go there, and, since he cannot pay, the effect of these provisions is stifling the operation of the original Act of 1906.<lb/>
The various enactments of the present Government have brought about a most extraordinary confusion in the state of affairs. First of all, we have the Agricultural Holdings Act passed by the noble Marquess in 1908, to which I have alluded. I know that the noble Marquess himself is extremely proud of that Act. Personally&#x2014;and I say it with profound respect&#x2014;I always regarded that Act as a most disastrous piece of legislation. What does that Act permit a tenant to do? A tenant on a holding is given full right to practice any system of cropping of the arable land and to dispose of the produce of the holding without incurring any forfeiture or liability. It is true that if the farming is very bad the landlord can bring an injunction and can bring in arbitrators. What has been the effect of that Act? Perhaps the noble Marquess will not mind my telling him what the effect has been in the locality in which I live. Oxfordshire is the second county in England to demand small holdings in point of numbers, and it is the second county in England to give small holdings in point of numbers. Under the beneficent legislation of the noble Marquess the tenant is permitted to farm as he likes. What does he do frequently? He finds an arable field which is difficult to work and costs him a considerable sum of money. He thinks to himself, "I will reduce the sum total of the capital on my farm and convert this arable field into somewhat indifferent and bad grass and I will run a few sheep over it, "and he forthwith proceeds to do so. What happens? The labourers are dismissed, and what are they to do? They may drift into towns; but the towns do not want them. They may emigrate; but noble Lords opposite are not going to advocate a policy of emigration, for that would be tantamount to admitting the failure of their social policy. Therefore all he can do is to make an application to the county council for a small holding. And what happens? The county council apply for a small
<col>342</col>
holding in the same locality where these men live. They probably select the very field in which these men have been working as labourers; they take it away from the tenant farmer and give it to these small holders, charging them in rent 5 or 6 per cent. more than the tenant had been paying. In addition the small holder has to compensate the tenant for his bad farming, and the money has to be found out of the small holder's pocket. That is what happens as a result of this clause in the Agricultural Holdings Act.<lb/>
There is really, I think, a complete confusion of ideas by this Act of 1908 introduced between the tenants and the labourers. It all comes from the Government's pernicious and vicious habit of insisting upon legislating by departments. In the first place, we had the Agricultural Holdings Act. That gave security of tenure to the tenants against the landlord. Then came the Small Holdings Act, which gave no security to the tenant against a public body. Then we had the Finance Act, which incidentally came along with its land clauses and said by the operation of those clauses that there was no room for the landlord in the general hierarchy of agriculture. Then we find the Small Holdings Act amended so as to grant compensation to tenants if dispossessed by a public body; and last, but by no means least, we find agitation to the effect that the small holders themselves are unable to pay this compensation, and a debate is raised in another place in which the question of involving the rates is discussed. The question of involving the rates is discussed for the reason that the whole basis of your agrarian policy has completely broken down. The financial basis is unsound, and the Government are driven, as a last resort, to discuss the most dangerous principle whether they can employ the rates to bolster up and make effective their bad financial administration.<lb/>
May I be permitted to say one word with regard to this question of rates, because it is just possible that what occurred only two nights ago in the House of Commons may have escaped the notice of many noble Lords in this House. I deeply regret that the noble Marquess is no longer at his post as President of the Board of Agriculture. Although we did not see eye to eye with him in many
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0197"/>
<col>343</col>
matters, yet we know perfectly well that he was a strong, capable, and active administrator and understood all the problems which were presented to his notice. I wish I could say the same of his successor. What did his successor admit only the other night in the House of Commons? He did not lay it down as a general principle; he did not state it as part and parcel of the policy of the Government&#x2014;it was wrung out of him in a negligent unwilling manner. He said he saw no reason why, when county councils buy land, the sinking fund which the county councils have to pay to the Government for the purchase of that land should not be made a charge on the ratepayers, and he added that if county councils chose to do that, he for his part, as head of the Board of Agriculture, would instruct the Auditor-General not to surcharge those amounts. I think I have accurately stated what the President of the Board of Agriculture said the other day in the House of Commons. Let us see what the effect of this dangerous and pernicious statement would be. I am bound to point out at this point that when the noble Marquess introduced his Small Holdings Act he gave a deliberate pledge that the rates should not be employed for the purpose of administering the Act. I am sorry I have not his words at hand, but I know he made a most definite statement that on no account should the rates be employed for the purpose of making the financial arrangements of the Act successful.<lb/>
But now what has happened? The Government now say that the rates may be employed for the purpose of paying the sinking fund. My Lords, it is not going to stop there if the rates are to be employed for the purpose of paying the sinking fund, why should they not be employed for the purpose of paying the compensation which the small holders have to pay to tenants who are dispossessed? As the noble Marquess knows, bad prices and a bad agricultural year frequently go together. What is to prevent the small holders going to the county council and saying, "We have had a bad year and have lost money and cannot pay. We desire you, the public body, to make good the deficiency from the rates of the county." There is a long vista of gross mal-administration ahead of us if the disastrous principle is admitted that the rates can
<col>344</col>
be employed to bolster up the unsound economic administration of the Government. That point I do commend to the notice of His Majesty's Ministers, and I sincerely trust that the noble Lord the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Agriculture will use his endeavours to prevent his chief from embarking upon a policy fraught with so many dangerous consequences.<lb/>
There is a sentence in this Report which I should like to refer to before I leave the subject of the Agricultural Holdings Act and the noble Marquess. It helps to pulverise that Act if that has not already been done. It occurs in the passage in which the Committee consider a scheme of State-aided purchase and lay down certain points to safeguard the State as <i>interim</i> landlord. Among the various provisos, the Committee lay down this: that it is essential that the land shall be farmed "in a husband-like manner." But, as I have already reminded your Lordships, under this beneficent Agricultural Holdings Act a tenant when he farms under your Lordships is entitled to farm as he likes, and the noble Marquess makes action on the part of the landlord to prevent the deterioration of the farm a most intricate, cumbrous, and troublesome business. I cannot help asking the noble Marquess this question, How are you going to reconcile the safeguards which this Committee thought necessary to be imposed if the State became an <i>interim</i> landlord dealing with <i>interim</i> tenants with the somewhat loose, and, if I may use the phrase, "sloppy" statutory enactments contained in the Agricultural Holdings Act in their relation between us as landlords and the tenants who serve under us?<lb/>
We come really to this question, What have Ministers done in the six or seven years they have been in office to help and make prosperous the first industry of the country? Let me take the landlord first of all. The noble Marquess, under the Agricultural Holdings Act, has destroyed the administrative powers formerly possessed by the landlord by giving the tenant the right to farm as he likes and more or less security against any interference on the part of the landlord; and by the land clauses in the Budget of 1909&#x2013;10 the landlord is slowly but surely going to be dispossessed That settles the landlord. Now as to the tenant. The tenant wishes
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0198"/>
<col>345</col>
to farm and to hold under the landlord, as is clearly laid down in this Report. Your legislation is making that impossible. The Report shows this over and over again. The tenant does not want his land taken away for small holdings, and you have legislated exactly contrary to his wish. That settles the tenant. Lastly, What about the former labourer who becomes a small holder? It is quite true you have given him a small holding. Some 9,000 small holders have been created within the last three years. Well and good. But observe what you do. You force the small holder to pay compensation for acquiring his land from the dispossessed tenant, and, if he farms land which the county council have bought through money advanced by the State, to pay not only the sinking fund but the interest on the borrowed money, and, incidentally, he is invited to serve under a landlord whose administrative charges the present President of the Board of Agriculture says may amount to a maximum of 20 per cent. and to a minimum of not less than 6 per cent. I am not sure that, so far as the financial aspect of the case is concerned, the small holder is in a specially agreeable position.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00678"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: That, of course, includes repairs.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00679"><member>THE DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: Yes, the repairs made by the county council. That is the present chaotic state of affairs, and I think we are entitled to ask what the Government intend to do to improve it. Now there are four possible policies laid down in this Report. In the first place, it is suggested that the landlord shall be retained. That is in accordance with the wishes of the tenants. Then there is a pious expression of opinion that the county council might be the landlord. As far as I can make out, that view was regarded rather benevolently. Furthermore, there was the suggestion to turn the tenants into owners by the aid of State banks. And, finally, there was a strong recommendation that the State itself should be the landlord to acquire the land and allow the tenants to farm under it. I know that many noble Lords hold various and different views as to the manner and method by which agricultural problems should be solved. The Committee seem rather to have felt that, because they showed a fine impartiality in incorporating in their Report all the different recommendations suggested to them. That
<col>346</col>
in itself may have been very wise and proper. But what I want to know this evening is this&#x2014;What is the policy of the Government themselves? Have they a policy? If they have, will they allow that policy to be made known to noble Lords in this House? I really do think, if I may say so with due respect to the noble Marquess the Leader of the House, that the time has come when the Ministry should make a full statement of their land policy. Although it will be a source of great interest to us to hear the views of the noble Lord the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Agriculture, yet I feel in a sense that his views will be those more or less of the Department.<lb/>
What we would like to hear to-night is the broad general policy which the Government propose to pursue with regard to the first industry of the country. I ask this, not because I personally feel that I am in the least entitled to do so, but I would draw the attention of the noble Marquess the Leader of the House to this fact, that the Departmental Committee was appointed by one of his own colleagues. It was at the express request of the Government themselves that they were asked to report, and in this Report the Committee say that the present uncertainty is militating against agriculture. Now if a Committee which you have yourselves appointed says that as a result of your policy the present uncertainty is militating against agriculture, I do think that in all fairness to the agricultural community the noble Marquess is bound to give some expression of opinion to this House as to the future policy of His Majesty's Government with regard to this difficult and complex problem. It is in the hope that we shall be able to extract some definite statement at the hands of His Majesty's Government that I have ventured to bring to your Lordships' notice to-night the interesting and admirable Report made by the Committee over which Lord Haversham presided.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00680"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HAVERSHAM</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I venture to ask your Lordships to accord me the privilege of intervening between the able and exhaustive speech of the noble Duke opposite, which I heard with the greatest admiration, and the necessary reply of my noble friend who represents the Board of Agriculture in this House. My claim to do so is that for ten months of last year I had the honour of presiding over the
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0199"/>
<col>347</col>
Committee which presented this Report. We heard evidence from every large agricultural association and club in the country and a great number of tenant farmers, valuers, solicitors, and others, and I think I cannot do better than commence by congratulating noble Lords on the opposite side of the House, who represent large properties and have numerous tenants under them, upon the universal testimony of the tenant farmers as to the excellent relations which exist between their landlords and themselves. I cannot express this better, or more concisely, than in the words of the Report itself&#x2014;
<quote>"Witnesses before the Committee were practically unanimous in expressing the view that the tenants farming on the large estates of England and Wales desired nothing better than to remain as tenants under their present landlords, and, in view of the remission of rent by landlords in had seasons and the execution of repairs and improvements over and above the strictly agricultural requirements of the farms, the position of tenants under good landlords is apparently a satisfactory one."</quote>
I think we shall all endorse that. But I am afraid this very happy state of relations is within an area which is gradually, year by year and almost week by week, becoming narrower.<lb/>
We had the advantage of having on our Committee Mr. Howard Frank, a member of the largest firm of auctioneers in this country especially concerned with the sale of landed estates, and he assured us that &#x00A3;1,500,000 worth of agricultural land was sold in 1910, and that last year the amount would be &#x00A3;2,000,000. I agree with the noble Duke that there is a great deal to be said for the operation of the Death Duties. I think it is quite clear that it is found necessary to part with portions of estates to find the large sums of money which are payable at a particular crisis. But the policy of Death Duties has been endorsed by both sides in politics and by Chancellors of the Exchequer of both Parties, and we cannot go back upon that. I think I ought to mention that considerable apprehension and alarm exist, not as to what has been done, but as to what is going to be done in the future. I refer to the new valuation. I think it is more that and what is to come which causes unrest among landlords and leads to the sale of estates than any Act which can be pointed to as having been injurious to the agricultural industry.<lb/>
But that is not by any means the whole story. There are a great many other causes
<col>348</col>
which have led to landed estates going into the market. I ask your Lordships to consider what a very great change there has been in what are called the amenities of landed property. I dare say many of your Lordships have read the recently published "Life of Charles Fox," by Sir George Trevelyan, in which he shows that at that time the greater part of the Lower House was composed of landlords, and that landed property then carried with it representation in the Commons House of Parliament certainly in all the counties and in most of the boroughs, except the King's. All that has passed away, and I myself remember hearing the late Lord Salisbury say in this House, before I was a member of it, that we must all admit that the landed interest is not the powerful interest in the House of Commons that it once was. I need not remind your Lordships that in those days nobody but landed proprietors were made magistrates or deputy-lieutenants. The status which landlords had in the counties has materially altered. A still more powerful reason for the sale of estates is the existence of an immense number of other funds in which capital can be invested and a higher rate of interest obtained than in land. That is, to my mind, the greatest cause of all. No doubt these are concurrent reasons, and I do not think it would be right for the noble Duke to assume that it is fear of legislation only which has induced landlords to sell. There is also a boom in land which has induced people to part with their estates. A very creditable reluctance exists on the part of landlords to raise the rents of old tenants. They prefer to sell their estates rather than raise the rents. All these reasons, of course, have led to great unrest among the tenants, and it was with the object of endeavouring to find some means of allaying that unrest that the noble Marquess, Lord Lincolnshire, appointed this Committee.<lb/>
The suggestion most popular with the tenant farmers who gave evidence before us was a system of State-aided purchase. They all thought that that would relieve matters much more than any of the smaller changes to which I will in a moment allude. The proposal we make was suggested by a member of the Committee, Sir Edward Holden, a very experienced financial authority and banker. Our proposal is that the State should advance &#x00A3;500,000, and that the tenants should be
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0200"/>
<col>349</col>
assisted out of this, which would be managed by a Land Bank. The tenants, we suggest, should have money advanced at 4 per cent.&#x2014;3&#x00BC; per cent. as interest, &#x00BD; per cent. for management, and &#x00BC; per cent. for sinking fund. I do not know whether that will find favour with His Majesty's Government, but it found favour in the eyes of the tenant farmers. We thought it better not to adopt the policy of giving the whole sum to the tenants, and we propose that they should provide one-fifth of the purchase money, and that the State should find the remaining four-fifths.<lb/>
I should like to be allowed to say one or two words with regard to the smaller changes to which the noble Duke alluded. In the first place, the most powerful alleviation next to State-aided purchase was the proposal to extend the notice to quit. I will state a concrete case so that the House can see where the shoe pinches. Supposing that a man who has a Michaelmas tenancy is given notice to quit. That notice would operate at the following Michaelmas. It happens that the sale of farms almost always takes place in June and July, and it is not possible for the tenant to know until June whether or not he will be allowed to stay on. He cannot before then negotiate with the new man, who has not yet purchased the farm. He cannot negotiate with his old landlord, because the latter does not know whether he will sell or not. The tenant, therefore, goes on until June in absolute ignorance of what his fate will be. When the farm is sold he has only two or three months until Michaelmas in which to look round and get a new farm. That is an intolerable hardship. We must remember that these men have very often created an extensive business. They may have established milk rounds, they may have got together a cheese industry and may have a number of labourers whom they desire to take with them to the next farm. But it is the most difficult thing in the world to find another farm in two months. We propose that in case of a sale the tenant may serve a counter-notice, which shall have the effect of extending his tenancy by one year&#x2014;not by two years, as stated by the noble Duke. I think that is a very fair thing. We say in the Report&#x2014;
<quote>"The majority of the witnesses were in favour of a longer notice to quit in all cases where the land is intended to be put up for sale, and with a view, therefore, to mitigate the injury and possible hardship inflicted at present on a tenant the Committee
<col>350</col>
recommend that, in cases where a tenant receives notice to quit for the purpose of sale, the tenant should be empowered to serve a counter-notice claiming that the notice to quit shall not, take effect until one year after the original notice would have expired. &#x2026; The Committee think that the suggested clause would give a tenant time to negotiate with his new landlord or to make, arrangements for obtaining another farm, and would go far towards removing any grievance under which he labours at present."</quote>
</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00681"><member>THE DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: I was rather at pains over that paragraph to make out whether the minimum term was two years or three years.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00682"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HAVERSHAM</member><membercontribution>: The term is two, years from the first notice&#x2014;that is, one year longer. But either party, the landlord or the tenant, may terminate the tenancy at any time he pleases, provided he makes an arrangement with the other. Our object was to secure by legislation that the tenant might claim by counter-notice an additional year. Then we say that where there is no time specified in the agreement two years shall be taken as the term. We think that that would have a very good effect in making tenants when they enter upon a holding claim two years at first, and that would be a great solution of the difficulty. The noble Duke spoke, I think, with some contempt of our proposal about small holdings. The effect is this, that if a landlord at the impulsion of the county council or of his own accord sells land for small holdings, then compensation is to be paid to the tenant whom he turns out. But the case is different if the land is sold at public auction. Then the county council are not to pay any compensation at all. All we propose is that the thing should be made equal, and however the land be obtained, if it is destined for small holdings, there should be compensation for the farmer who is turned out.<lb/>
The Committee make another small recommendation which I think will commend itself to your Lordships. It is to alter the time at which a man may put in his claim for compensation. As the law stands at present, a man must make his claim for compensation within two months of receiving notice to quit. I put the question to a great many of the leading witnesses, valuers and estate men, and they all said they saw no reason whatever why this particular period was taken. We say&#x2014;and all the witnesses agreed with us&#x2014;that it would be fair that a man should
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0201"/>
<col>351</col>
be allowed to put in his claim for compensation at any time within two months of the date when his tenancy expires. That is our recommendation. We did all we could to find the best possible means of assisting tenant farmers. We shall be quite satisfied if the smaller recommendations are, as a preliminary, adopted. Of course, we should be very glad indeed if the financial scheme which we propound could be adopted by the Government. That would be the most effective remedy of all; but, apart from that, I am quite sure that considerable good would be accomplished were some of the smaller recommendations contained in the Committee's Report carried into effect.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00683"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I gladly associate myself with the remarks which fell from the noble Lord opposite, because, having sat with him for some ten months on this Committee, I know that it is very largely owing to his careful management of the Committee, which was composed of people representing almost every possible view, that he has been able to get them to produce a practically unanimous Report. I also fully associate myself with his half-expressed, but, I think, almost withdrawn, expression of regret that the Government should have launched into a system of financial policy which has caused such serious evil. What he and the noble Duke have said in that direction has made more clear than the Report makes it that the sale of estates and the consequent difficulties in which tenants find themselves are due, not only to past legislation, but to a fear of legislation that may be to come, and very largely due to the operations of the Small Holdings Act under which a large tenant no longer feels himself safe in his holding. It has been the purpose of almost all Agricultural Holdings Acts passed in the interests of tenant farmers to make their position as secure as possible, and every agricultural authority will, no doubt, lay down that security of tenure is a first essential. Consequently anything that acts against that must be against agricultural interests in this country. And this Committee, appointed to look into the position of tenant farmers who are dispossessed owing to Government action, have taken fully into consideration that it is the obvious duty of Parliament to, as far as possible, restore to tenants that security which has been taken away.<lb/>
<col>352</col>
There are some minor recommendations put forward by the Committee which are in no sense a remedy of the evils of which we have to complain, but which yet may alleviate the difficulties. The noble Lord who presided over the Committee has told the House very fully the position in which the tenant would be after giving a counter-notice to his landlord. I do not agree with the noble Duke that that will make land unsaleable or lower the value. If a man buys an estate in a large plot the last thing he wants is for the tenants to leave. He wants to enter into an estate which is fully equipped with substantial tenants. The case is slightly different when land is sold farm by farm and there is a possibility of occupying owners coming in; but, even then, I do not believe that the term of notice will really prevent a good sale taking place. It has been my fortune to sell a large number of holdings, but in no case have I given notice before sale. It has always been after sale for the purchaser to make arrangements with the tenants. The recommendation of the Committee will extend that notice to two years, and if that recommendation takes effect and is acted upon by tenants it is obvious that no land will be sold with vacant possession. Therefore nobody will expect to have vacant possession, and consequently it cannot in any degree affect the value of land. At the same time it will give a most important safeguard to the tenants themselves that they will not be turned out at a moment's notice and without having sufficient time to find another farm.<lb/>
But the really important part of this Report is undoubtedly contained in the recommendation for State-aided purchase. I believe that almost every witness who came before the Committee expressed himself strongly of opinion that some form of State-aided purchase was necessary under present circumstances. It was laid down very clearly, both by witnesses and by members of the Committee, that it was essential in any scheme of State-aided purchase that it should be run without any risk to the Government who aided the purchase, and that it should be run on commercial lines and the interest of the State safeguarded in every possible way. At the same time it is obvious that the rate of interest and the sinking fund must be such as the tenant can pay without dipping into any of his capital now employed in
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0202"/>
<col>353</col>
farming, his land. The Committee were agreed that it was essential that the combined rate of interest and sinking fund should not exceed the present net rent which is being paid for the land. In Sir Edward Holden's scheme, which was adopted by the Committee, it is presumed that 4 per cent. interest will be sufficient to pay interest, sinking fund, and other charges and pay off the loan within seventy-five years. They adopted, I think, the 4 per cent. rate because they were of opinion that, generally speaking, land was now selling at twenty-five years' purchase, but it is obvious that the number of years' purchase must vary according to many considerations, and I do not think it would be difficult to have a scheme whereby the sinking fund might be varied.<lb/>
My view is that 4 per cent. is unnecessarily severe on the tenant. I think that in most cases the State could afford to lend at a lower rate than 4 per cent. I do not think that it is in any degree necessary that the State or the banking institution should take &#x00BD; per cent. for interest and management. As a matter of fact, the risk in a scheme of this kind is very small indeed. It is not proposed under this scheme to lend more than four-fifths of the purchase money. Consequently the security is a tolerably good one from the beginning, and by the operation of the sinking fund is improving every year; and while it may be thought, perhaps, that some charge should be made for the risk at the beginning of the period of the loan, I think it would be unfair to continue that charge for risk right through the number of years during which the loan remains. One should recollect also that, if &#x00BC; per cent. is charged for sinking fund and will pay off the loan in seventy-five years and another &#x00BC; per cent. is charged for risk right through that period, the tenant in effect is paying for his farm twice over.<lb/>
There is, I think, a further objection possibly to the actual scheme which the Committee have adopted, and that is in the requirement to pay down one-fifth of the purchase money. I know that noble Lords opposite and members of the Government point to the fact that no tenant wants to buy in this country because they have not taken advantage of the purchase scheme under the Small Holdings Act of
<col>354</col>
1892. I am absolutely certain that tenants have not taken advantage of the purchase provisions of that Act on account of this very requirement which is put into Sir Edward Holden's scheme&#x2014;that a percentage of the purchase money has to be paid down. It is tolerably certain that although a certain class of farmer might be able to pay down one-fifth of the purchase money those would be the farmers who could buy without assistance. I venture to criticise Sir Edward Holden's scheme in those two particulars, though I signed the Report as far as that scheme was concerned. It appeared to me that those were particulars that might be amended, and it seemed to me very essential that the Committee generally, almost every one of us being in favour of State-aided purchase, should be as unanimous as possible on that point.<lb/>
There is one feature of the Report to which I take great objection and I have signed a reservation to that effect. I refer to the proposal as to State purchase. I cannot believe that any scheme of State purchase is either financially, politically, or agriculturally sound. I can imagine it possibly of advantage that the State should occasionally step in and purchase land for immediate re-sale to a tenant, but that is merely a moderation or extension of State-aided purchase. But I disapprove in the strongest possible way of the paragraph in the Report which suggests that the State should step in and buy large blocks of land and occupy them, I suppose, as an ordinary landlord. If the State buys large blocks of land there must be included in those Hocks much land which will be of an unremunerative nature; consequently a proper return cannot be got on the money expended for the purchase of that land, and a burden will be entailed on the ratepayers. We hear of the evils of absenteeism. The State itself would be a permanent absentee; its management of the estate would be by an official. And while I believe that State-aided purchase, if properly carried out, would of itself be a real remedy for the evils which we found were increasing, I cannot believe that State purchase would be of advantage. I await with anxiety to hear what view the Government themselves take of this Report, and how far they are prepared to take up the scheme of State-aided purchase which we recommend.</membercontribution></p>

In that I do not wish to throw any blame at him. He himself reminded me that the position of Under-Secretaries is a somewhat insignificant one.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00685"><member>THE DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: I did not use the word "insignificant."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00686"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: No; but what he said meant very much the same thing. The noble Duke used so many adjectives in the course of his speech that if I apply the wrong one in this connection I hope he will forgive me. I do not wish to blame the noble Duke. After all, he is only following the policy of the other occupants of his own Front Bench and of the official leaders of his Party. While they have to a certain extent dallied or flirted with the general question of State-aided purchase they have never committed themselves to the policy, and I hope that this debate to-night is going to have this result, that we are going to draw from noble Lords sitting on the Front Bench opposite some definite statement as to what their intention is with regard to this very big question.<lb/>
Before I proceed to deal with the points raised in the Report I would like to make one or two remarks on what the noble Duke said. I hesitate to again try and quote his adjectives, but he certainly condemned very strongly the policy of the Government with regard to its various Acts. He made an attack upon the Agricultural Holdings Act, 1908, but failed entirely to show what harm it had done to agriculture, which is the only test that can be applied. He quoted cases where the powers of the landlord had been curtailed, and it is quite obvious that that was the intention of the Act in certain respects. Our contention is that curtailing the powers of the landlord in certain respects, as that Act did, has not militated against or done harm to the interests of agriculture. In fact, it has had an opposite
<col>356</col>
effect and its general effect on agriculture has been good. Since the passing of that Act&#x2014;I do not say it is due to the Act, but the Act has been a contributory cause&#x2014;agriculture has been in an unusually prosperous condition. The noble Duke referred to the question whether or not it is desirable to place the sinking fund charges on the acquisition of small holdings upon the rates. He seemed to think that that was a dangerous and wasteful policy. After all, what is the position? The position is this, that the land is being acquired, and at the end of the period of eighty years when the loan is completely paid off the land will be the property of the county council. At the present moment it is being paid for by the small holder. He is, in fact, purchasing the land for the county council; and I cannot see that it is dangerous for the county council, if it chooses, to pay for the land of which it is at the end of that period to become the possessor. We do not express an opinion as to whether we think it desirable or not. That is a question which the county councils have to settle for themselves, but, if they do choose to do it, it is a policy which is neither wasteful nor can it be described as dangerous.<lb/>
The noble Duke spoke of the break-up of some of the great landed estates and the sales that have taken place as a disaster, but a great many people hold an absolutely opposite view. A great part of the land that has been sold consisted of outlying portions of large estates. We know perfectly well from experience that the ownership of large outlying estates to which the owner and his agent can at the best only devote a certain portion of their time is not an ideal system of ownership. That some of those outlying estates should pass out of the hands of their present owners into the hands of other people is not necessarily a disaster. When the noble Duke tries to make out, as he did, that under present conditions nobody would wish to buy the land, I can only remind him of the good prices reached in the market, showing that the apprehensions which exist in the minds of some people are not shared by everybody and that there are plenty of people who are ready to invest their money in land. In these circumstances I do not see why we should suppose that the passing of the land into a greater number of hands is necessarily going to have a bad effect on agriculture
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0204"/>
<col>357</col>
as a whole. It was the sale of these estates that led to the appointment by my noble friend behind me of this Departmental Committee. One cannot help noticing, and the Committee themselves noticed, that as a matter of fact the cases of hardship which the Committee were specifically asked to inquire into have proved of extremely rare occurrence. In paragraph 16 the Committee say&#x2014;
<quote>"Several witnesses stated, either that no hard cases of dispossession kind inability to obtain another holding had been brought to their notice or that they were comparatively rare, and it would be impossible to maintain, in the face of this evidence, that the grievanees, however acute in individual cases, are widespread."</quote>
I think there is no question about that. The cases are comparatively small in number. No doubt when they do occur they are hard cases, but hard cases make bad law, and one has to proceed with a good deal of caution when trying to legislate on grounds of this kind.<lb/>
The recommendations of the Committee divide themselves into two parts. There are, first of all, the earlier recommendations, which suggest remedies for what may be called allaying the fears of the tenant; and in the latter part of the Report come what are more in the nature of heroic remedies to deal with the case. This Committee is by no means the first Committee of the kind which has advocated a system of State-aided laud purchase. That the grounds for so doing appeared a little insufficient is an opinion which I think a good many people who read the Report will themselves hold. After all, the main point in this Report is the definite recommendation of land purchase, and we cannot discuss the Report without first of all dealing with that particular case. Land purchase is suggested, as I have already said, in order to meet a very small number of hard cases. The Report does not go deeply into the question of finance. I do not say it does not suggest methods of finance. But every one who has studied the matter knows what an enormous undertaking a policy of State-aided land purchase would be. It is only suggested here that it should apply to those tenants who are in danger of being dispossessed, but I do not think any Government would be justified in embarking on that scheme on such a footing. If the thing were a success, pressure would be brought to bear on the Government which the
<col>358</col>
Government sooner or later would not be able to resist. We know what has taken place in Ireland, and I do not think any Government could go in for a system of State-aided land purchase without contemplating that it would sooner or later have to undertake a general system of assisting the purchase of all land at present held by tenants. That raises an enormous financial question which I am not competent to discuss, and I do not wish to do so, but the figures of Irish land purchase disappear into insignificance by the side of the figures which would be involved in any scheme for land purchase in this country.<lb/>
After all, is land purchase really asked for or required in this country? The whole of the evidence taken before this Committee goes to show that it is not required. There is no real demand for land purchase <i>qua</i> land purchase. There is a demand for land purchase as being better than being turned out of a farm, but it is the undoubted desire of the great majority of farmers in this country to remain as tenants, and one has further evidence of that in the very small extent to which opportunities of land purchase are taken up by tenant fanners. Yon have the evidence, already mentioned by Lord Clinton, of what has taken place in connection with the Small Holdings Act, where under 2 per cent. of small holders have availed themselves of the opportunity of purchase. I believe that what tenant farmers attach much greater importance to than purchase is security. If they cannot get security, then they are prepared, on terms which they are capable of meeting, to purchase their holdings. But given the requisite amount of security they put tenancy as the best thing and ownership as the second best thing. Even supposing it were desired, is ownership a suitable thing in this country? If one looks at what has taken place here, if one examines what has been the history of the men who have held land in this country, one cannot but be forced to the conclusion that, for some reason or another which one cannot explain off-hand, ownership is not suited to the farming population of this country.<lb/>
The three best instances of that are, first, the yeomen farmers of this country. As a class yeomen farmers were wiped out by the bad times of thirty and forty years
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0205"/>
<col>359</col>
ago, and they have practically disappeared. A more remarkable case still is that of what were called the statesmen of the North of England. They have all disappeared as a class, and the curious thing about them is that the majority of them disappeared, not in bad times, but in good. They were bought out at a time when they could get good prices for their land, and those who remained disappeared when bad times came. There was another class&#x2014;the freeholders of the Isle of Axholme, in Lincolnshire. They farmed some of the finest land in this country. The majority of them have disappeared, and of those who remain many are seriously hampered with mortgages. Whenever there has been a system of ownership in this country it does not seem to have lasted long; during recent years it does not seem to have survived, and one is reluctantly forced to the conclusion that for one reason or another the ownership system is not suited to the farmers of this country.<lb/>
There was a question raised by Lord Clinton as to the desirability, if you are going to have a system of purchase, of asking some deposit from the tenant. With regard to that, I think that the Irish analogy, which is often quoted, for asking for no deposit at all is rather a false one. The Irish system is quite unlike the English system, and the Irish tenant's stake in his holding is so much greater that he has to a large extent paid his deposit. But at any rate opinion, as far as it has been officially expressed, has been very strongly in favour of the deposit system. The three Committees that have sat on the subject&#x2014;the Select Committee of the House of Commons in 1889, presided over by Mr. Chamberlain; the Departmental Committee in 1906, presided over by the late Lord Onslow; and Lord Haversham's Committee&#x2014;have all reported, though in the last two cases there was a dissentient, in favour of the deposit system. As Lord Clinton pointed out, that is one of the great difficulties. If you adopt that system, as it is practically universally recommended that you should do, you do undoubtedly lock up a much greater part of the money of farmers in the land than they can afford. Farmers as a class, considering the amount of land they farm, do it on comparatively small capital, and are not as a class capable of putting their capital into the land and
<col>360</col>
still farming as well as they do at present. I think that is a very strong argument&#x2014;you cannot get a stronger&#x2014;against the system of State purchase. Therefore, you are forced to one of two things&#x2014;either to the system where you extract no deposit, where, although the land is nominally the tenant's, you have no hold over him and he has no obligation to you and can if he likes farm his land out or quit and leave the land on the hands of the State, or to the system where the tenant has to pay a deposit. That is the position that people who are in favour of State-aided purchase have to face and get over.<lb/>
The position that we are asked to face in regard to this particular sale of estates is, I think, this. We are told that owing to the feeling of insecurity that exists among tenant farmers at the present time they are in a considerable number of cases buying their own farms, not because they want to, but because they are afraid of being turned out, and that because there is no machinery for enabling them to purchase they have to raise what they can by mortgage or loan at high rates of interest in order to remain on their farms. That may or may not be the position. I cannot say. But I think the real point we have to get at is this. How far is the fanner really justified in his fears? He may be merely doing this out of more or less unreasonable fear of being turned out. Lord Clinton stated that in the cases which had come under his personal notice the tenants were not given notice to quit and therefore did not buy their farms. What we have to do is to try and allay the fears of the farmer as much as possible, so that he shall not be driven to the extremity of buying his farm when he does not wish to do so. As far as you can gather from the Report and from the experience of such people as Lord Clinton the actual number who will really be dispossessed will be very small indeed. It is to meet that part of the difficulty that the earlier recommendations in the Report have, I understand, been framed, and I must say I think that, on the whole, they are the most valuable part of the Report. I think that, as has been pointed out, there is a great deal in them that will help to tide the farmer over the period of uncertainty. The suggestion of the counter-notice seems to me to be a very good one. The noble Duke appeared to think that it would merely double the
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0206"/>
<col>361</col>
period of suspense under which the tenant would rest. I do not think he quite understands the usual conditions under which these sales take place. As I understand, what happens at the present moment is that a man receives notice to quit, and that three months or a few months before the notice expires the sale takes place.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00687"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: That is not by any means invariably the case.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00688"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: I agree; but that seems to be what is taking place. Instead of having only a year to look round and try and find another farm, the tenant is to have, if he likes, twice that time, or, if the sale takes place within let us say nine months of the time that he received notice, he would, under the recommendation of the Committee, still have fifteen months to remain on the farm, which would give him time either to come to terms with the new landlord&#x2014;and in the majority of cases we have every reason to believe that he would come to terms&#x2014;or to look round and make other arrangements. Another good result will be that this will to a great extent do away with land speculators, people who buy estates and then try and turn them over as quickly as they can at the best price they can get. In those ways I think the Committee's recommendation would probably be a distinct help to the tenant farmer. The second, third, and fourth recommendations of the Committee all appear to us of value as tending to allay the anxieties of the tenant farmer. The Government are prepared to legislate along the lines of those three recommendations.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00690"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: The second, third, and fourth recommendations are the ones which are at the present moment specially selected. That is the policy which we have marked out for ourselves. We are definitely opposed to any system of assisted purchase. But, on the other hand, where we can give the tenant a greater feeling of security than he has at present, where we can fairly and legitimately increase the tenant's security, we are prepared to do everything we can along those lines. We believe that security is a much better panacea for the evils farmers suffer from, and it is that part of this Report which makes recommendations along those lines that we think the most valuable, and on which we are prepared to take action.</membercontribution></p>
<col>362</col>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00691"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I certainly am not surprised that the noble Lord who has spoken on behalf of His Majesty's Government should be unwilling to go further than the points which he has just stated to your Lordships. He has undertaken, I understand, that the Government will legislate on the following lines&#x2014;First, that in the absence of agreement, two years' notice should be required to determine the tenancy of an agricultural holding; secondly, that except when notice to quit is given for one of the purposes referred to in Section 23 of the Agricultural Holdings Act, 1908, or where the tenancy is for a period of twelve months or less, notices to quit for less than twelve months should be made void by Statute; and, thirdly, that the tenant should be empowered to demand extended notice in the case of a sale. I confess they do not seem to be very important points, and I am afraid they will not meet the desire of the noble Duke who raised this question or of the noble Lord, Lord Clinton, who has taken such an active part on the Committee which devoted so much time to the subject. But though I should not wish to oppose the minute legislation proposed, I doubt if it will do anybody very much good.<lb/>
I doubt whether the second recommendation of the Committee&#x2014;that in the absence of agreement two years' notice shall be required&#x2014;will have any action at all. Agreements are almost universal, and they will continue to be, as they are now, for one year's notice. I also doubt whether the second recommendation&#x2014;that except when notice to quit is given for one of the purposes referred to in Section 23 of the Agricultural Holdings Act, 1908, or where the tenancy is for a period of twelve months or less, notices to quit for less than twelve months should be made void by Statute&#x2014;will have any practical effect. I think it is very rarely that notice for less than twelve months is given, and I agree it ought not to be less than twelve months. Therefore what the proposal of the Government really amounts to is this, that where an estate is to be sold a sitting tenant is to be allowed to give a counter-notice which will give him a year's further occupation. That will be of service, I believe, to the sitting tenant, but it may prove of considerable disservice in the sale of estates, especially if the sale, as is so common nowadays,
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0207"/>
<col>363</col>
is in comparatively small lots. The purchaser of a large estate is not likely to desire to occupy it himself, and may not at all care how long it may be, within a reasonable period, before the sitting tenants leave. In fact, he may desire to keep them, and very often does. But where an estate is broken up into lots and sold to small purchasers, some of those small purchasers will desire to occupy the lots themselves and to that extent the change will be a disadvantage to that very sale of estates which the noble Lord on behalf of His Majesty's Government desires to promote.<lb/>
Then the interference&#x2014;for it is an interference so far as it goes&#x2014;with the present administrative rights of the landlord as to the notice which he can give to his tenants does, to that extent, diminish his power over his estate, and is another step tending to diminish a landlord's power over his property and therefore his interest in it and so sap the very foundation of the English agricultural system, which is that the landlord should do the repairs and keep his property in order for his tenants. Therefore it is not with any great feeling of satisfaction that I have listened on this matter to the speech of the noble Lord, but I quite admit the defence of the Government. They have appointed a Committee, and the Committee has not made one recommendation, but has made what I think I remember Mr. Gladstone described on one occasion as a "litter of reports," and it is almost impossible for any Government to legislate where there is such a wide difference of opinion as there is in this Report.<lb/>
I listened with interest to Lord Clinton, but I would venture with all respect to him to say that when he advocated a system of advancing Government funds for the purchase of farms by tenants generally he advocated a very dangerous policy indeed. He almost took it for granted that the State could always lend at 3&#x00BC;per cent. I do not think anybody who has watched our finances for the last ten or twelve years can possibly believe that you can fix a limit of that kind to the rate at which the State can borrow. Just look at the history of the Irish Land Act of 1903. There never was a piece of more unsound finance than that Act, and it has proved to be so. It had to be altered by the Government opposite two years ago.
<col>364</col>
The 3&#x00BC; per cent. which was laid down in the Act of 1903 as the annual instalment for principal and interest had to be raised to 3&#x00BD; per cent., and looking at the point at which the Funds now stand, producing to a purchaser as much as &#x00A3;3 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per cent., who can say that the credit of this country may not soon sink to 3&#x00BD; per cent. I would venture to point out that this really is at the root of the whole matter.<lb/>
There seem to me to be two points which are essential to remember in any scheme of purchase by tenants of their farms with the aid of the State. The first is that the tenant will not give more, or at any rate more than a trifle more, as the annual instalments for both principal and interest, than he has been accustomed to pay as rent. That was true in Ireland and it will be more true in England, because in England the tenant wishes to remain a tenant farmer; he does not wish to be an owner, unless the estate is sold. Therefore you may take it as absolutely certain that except in that case he will not nay more for the instalments of capital and interest than he has been in the habit of paying in rent. This cannot be arranged unless the State is able to borrow money at a low rate. It is only when we can borrow for our existing engagements, as we could a few years ago, at less than 3 per cent. that it is possible for a system of purchase by tenants with the aid of State loans, to be at all widely carried on in England. And remember that if such a system were inaugurated by Parliament every million that you borrowed to carry it further would increase the rate of interest which the State would have to give for its money. At the present moment the continued increase of Irish Land Stock is a material factor in the fall in the price of Consols, and I think any one who compares the values of Irish land and English land will feel that any large system of purchase by tenants of their farms in England, bearing in mind the two great factors to which I have ventured to call your Lordships' attention, is practically impossible. It is no use inaugurating any such system unless it is widely availed of, and I say it cannot be widely availed of because you cannot bring to-together the rate which the tenant will pay and the rate at which the State can borrow, unless you are advisedly to make such loans at a loss to the State, a policy which I hope no Parliament will ever adopt.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0208"/>
<col>365</col>
The noble Lord dismissed the idea of aiding tenants on estates which are sold to purchase their farms because he thought it involved the necessity of extending a system of aided purchase to all tenants all over the country. I do not see that necessity. I think it might be possible, with adequate safeguards to secure that no price should be given for a farm that is above its real market value, which, of course, could be done by commissioners or valuers appointed by the Board of Agriculture, to advance money to tenants on farms which perhaps they and their ancestors before them had occupied many years and which were being sold, to enable those tenants to become purchasers, without going any further.<lb/>
Remember, my Lords, what the position is. The noble Duke alluded at considerable length to the causes&#x2014;increased taxation, want of confidence in your general legislation with regard to land, and causes quite apart from Government or Parliament&#x2014;which have decreased the value of land (for it is nonsense to talk of a boom in agricultural land at the present time); and have made many owners of large lauded estates desire to get out of at any rate a large portion of their property and invest the money in securities which would bring them in a larger income and not be so liable to be interfered with to their injury by the State. Landlords are selling outlying properties. That is the position. Are there any persons you would more wish to see purchase them than the farmers who with their ancestors have been on the farms for generations? I do not venture to dogmatise on the subject. I know the dangers; I know the financial difficulties; but I do think that if His Majesty's Government, in place of their negation of any possibility of dealing with the subject on these lines, would devote themselves to the consideration of that part of it, and examine whether it would not be possible through the organisation of the Board of Agriculture to make reasonable advances&#x2014;if you like requiring a deposit&#x2014;to tenant purchasers in such cases, I think they might do something to undo the mischief which they have done and to assist the tenants in that which they themselves admit to be an undesirable and unfortunate position.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00692"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LINCOLNSHIRE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Duke in his interesting
<col>366</col>
speech claimed, and rightly claimed, that Oxfordshire had done extremely well in connection with small holdings. I entirely agree, and I say that it is to a great extent owing to the example and the public spirited conduct of the noble Duke himself that that very desirable result has been attained. After all, hard words break no bones. The Duke of Portland, the Duke of Bedford, and the Duke of Northumberland have all given land for small holdings. I do not in the least mind what these noble Dukes say about the Government or any member of it, past or present. What I do mind is what they do, and I must say that the aid which has been given by these noble Dukes to the small holdings movement shows that a Duke's bite is much less dangerous than his bark.<lb/>
The noble Duke has attacked our policy; he has described himself as having "pulverised our sloppy enactments," and he has told us that on account of the Death Duties there may be no landlords left, and it is questionable whether in consequence of the work of my noble friend behind me any tenant farmers will exist at all. I really think the noble Duke, after what he has done in aid of agriculture, has no right to pose as a sort of agricultural Solomon Eagle. Things are not so bad as he tries to make out. If they were, there would be a panic. If the condition of agriculture were as bad as the noble Duke has represented, and if noble Lords in this House, who own one-third of the land of England, regarded the Committee's recommendations as dangerous, is it conceivable that only thirty-nine Peers would have been present when the noble Duke began to speak? Why in that case noble Lords would have come down to the House tumbling over each other in their anxiety to voice their denunciations. I think such indifference as we see here to-day must be held to show that, on the whole, the members of the House of Lords, the great landowners in this country, are to a great extent satisfied with the proposals which have been recommended.<lb/>
I was called to account by the noble Duke on the subject of the "atrocious and unfair" proposal that small holders should pay for the fee simple of their land with the rent, and he also said that it would be unfair and atrocious that this
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0209"/>
<col>367</col>
charge should be put on the rates. Well he cannot have it both ways. That point, however, has been so well treated by my noble friend Lord Lucas that I will not detain the House upon it. Then the noble Duke asked what the Liberal Government had done for the agricultural interests in the last six years. Well, I will tell him. We have passed twenty-one agricultural Bills out of twenty-two which were brought forward. That is not a bad record, especially as one or two of the Bills were not exactly framed to the taste of noble Lords opposite; and noble Lords will remember that those Bills were passed at a time when the House of Lords was omnipotent and irresponsible and in a somewhat truculent mood. Besides that, we have provided grants amounting to &#x00A3;500,000 annually to the agricultural interest. Is not that something? And since I have resigned the Presidency of the Board of Agriculture my right hon. friend Mr. Runciman has shown his zeal and energy by obtaining another annual grant of &#x00A3;80,000 for the Agricultural Department, following the recommendations of the Committee presided over by my noble friend Lord Reay. That is a further considerable benefit to this great interest. Then we have 150 square miles of land let in small holdings; and as regards the Crown lands, which are now under the Board of Agriculture, the rents have in the last three or four years been reduced in one instance from &#x00A3;18 or &#x00A3;20, around Scarborough, to &#x00A3;4 or &#x00A3;5 an acre, and cottages that were let at 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, 4<i>s.</i>, and 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> have been reduced to is and 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week, and land which was in hand and which was cultivated at enormous expense by the State has been let to tenants, with the result that at the present moment some thousands of pounds a year more are paid into the Exchequer than were paid in three years ago.<lb/>
Then by the Budget of 1909&#x2013;10, which was denounced by the House of Lords as atrocious and iniquitous, agricultural taxation has been relieved by &#x00A3;417,000 a year. Honestly speaking, I do think that this record compares very favourably with that of noble Lords opposite during the twenty years during which, with the exception of three years in between when a Liberal Government was in office, they were in power. The Unionist Party were practically in power for twenty years, and what did they do for the agricultural interest? We
<col>368</col>
have it on the authority of the late Lord Onslow, whose death we all sincerely deplore, that during the last five years that the Tory Government were in power agricultural affairs were only discussed for six hours in the Commons House of Parliament. The Land Tenure Act for which I was responsible has been strongly attacked by the noble Duke. Perhaps I may be forgiven if I say one word as to how that Act was introduced and how it was carried. When the Liberal Government came into power in 1905 Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman said to me, "We must tackle the land question and tackle it in earnest." He referred to the abortive Tory legislation of the previous twenty years and to the land hunger which he asserted existed in England at that time. Noble Lords will remember the sarcasm and the howls of laughter from the Opposition Benches when the words "land hunger" were used. "Land hunger," they said, "why we have it on the authority of agricultural experts&#x2014;the old Tory agricultural correspondents&#x2014;that there is a great deal too much land and that nobody wants land." The reason why nobody asked for land was that they knew they could not get it. We have it on the greatest authority that the meek should inherit the earth, but I do not know whether your Lordships saw in the newspapers a very caustic remark of a reverend friend of mine, the silver-tongued Sylvester Horne, who said, "Is it any use telling the landless men to be meek when there is no earth left to inherit?"<lb/>
The land six years ago was in the hands of a very few people in this country. The object of the Liberal Party was to put more people on the land, and the first thing that we had to do was to break up the great estates. That is being done to the great advantage of the people who are getting on the land, and of the landlords who, either because they have encumbered estates or because they want a little more pocket money for themselves and their wives, desire to get out of the land. I do not think there is anybody in this House who would maintain that the old system of big estates was one that was conducive to the welfare or the peace and prosperity of the community at large. What had we to do? We had to devise a plan to put more people on the land. That was the great object that we had in view, and the next object was to give
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0210"/>
<col>369</col>
security of tenure at fair rents to existing tenants. To do that, of course, two things were necessary to be done. The first was to give compensation for disturbance, and the second was to get a Land Court to fix prices when land was sold and to fix the rent when it was hired. I am glad to say that in six years we have obtained both those things.<lb/>
Our scheme was opposed in the House of Commons by the Surveyors' Institute, that great conservative body which is held in such high estimation by the public, and if I had not had at my back the Farmers' Union which was started at that time we should never have got the compensation clause through. Words strong enough could not be found by the landlords to anathematise the proposed Land Court. Yet we have it in the Scottish Bill which my noble friend Lord Pentland got through Parliament with your Lordships' permission last session. We there have a Land Court of the most extreme description. Your Lordships passed a clause in which you allowed this Land Court to fix the price of land that was to be sold or the rent at which land was to be let, and this was to be fixed by one single man selected by the Minister who held the office of President of the Board of Agriculture and against whose decision there was no appeal. Can you conceive anything more monstrous than that? How on earth that ever was allowed to be passed in a House composed of sensible men I do not know. Yet how right you were to pass it. For what has been the result? All the prognostications of failure which we heard have entirely fallen through. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Alverstone, and other noble Lords got up in this House and called attention to imaginary grievances, but there has not been one noble Lord in this House who, when he was brought to book, has been able to prove a single case of hardship.<lb/>
As an independent member, I can most honestly congratulate my noble friend Lord Haversham upon the result of the labours of his Committee. It shows that in spite of what has been said on the other side of the House the land policy of the Government has in no way depreciated the value of land. I challenge anybody to contradict that statement. There is a keen demand for land all over the country,
<col>370</col>
and though the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, was good enough to say that it was nonsense to state that there was a boom in land, how does he get over this&#x2014;that farms have fetched from twenty-eight to thirty years' purchase? I myself sold not long ago a 200-acre farm for &#x00A3;8,500. At the same time I bought four farms in Buckinghamshire that were paying 3&#x00BD; per cent. That shows what an excellent thing it is that land should be able to be transferred from one person to another, of course under proper conditions and without inflicting hardships on the tenants. Mr. Long has admitted in the House of Commons that the new Land Taxes have not affected agricultural land, though they have in some cases, he says, caused hardship to the sitting tenants. On that I need not detain your Lordships, because that point has been admirably dealt with by my noble friend Lord Haversham.<lb/>
I am extremely glad to see that my right hon. friend Mr. Runciman approves of the extended notice, because this was one of the unanimous recommendations of the Welsh Land Commission over which I had the honour to preside in 1893 and 1894. We proposed that in cases of death or of sale or transfer of estate the tenants should be protected in their holdings for three years certain. It was said that that would be too long a time, that it would interfere with sales, and now two years' notice instead of one has been suggested. I think this extended notice to two years will go very far to remove the grievances that now exist. I should like to ask, Are the Opposition prepared to support this? It would be very interesting to have an answer to that question. All the farmer witnesses without exception approved of it; but a reservation against it was signed by my friend Mr. Howard Frank, a great auctioneer, and by Captain Weigall, the only Conservative Member of Parliament who served on the Committee. This Committee has also rendered a signal service to the country at large by driving the last nail into the coffin of my old and valued friend Mr. Jesse Collings's land purchase scheme. Nobody can now say with any semblance of truth that there is any desire among the farmers for purchase for its own sake. That has gone by the board for ever. The Committee rejected by 12 to 1 Mr. Jesse Collings's proposal of requiring no deposit and of advancing the whole of
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0211"/>
<col>371</col>
the purchase money. That was most satisfactorily denounced by Lord Faber and other practical persons in the last session of Parliament. Yet though these proposals are denounced in this House they are trumpeted, placarded, and advertised by Conservative speakers all over the country. The noble Duke who initiated this discussion' has asked a question which no doubt will be answered by my noble friend and Leader below me when he replies on the whole debate. The noble Duke asked, What is the policy of the Liberal Government as regards agriculture I should have thought that any person who had passed the fourth standard would have been able to answer that question. We have laid our cards on the table. All our Bills have been brought before the House, most of them have been passed, and I should have thought that the Liberal policy was plain enough to any one.<lb/>
But perhaps the noble Duke will permit me to ask him&#x2014;and through him perhaps we may get some information from the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition&#x2014;two or three questions. Do the Opposition really intend, as stated on almost every platform in the country, to offer Irish terms to English farmers? Yes or no. Do they consider that the cases of the two countries are at all parallel? Yes or no. How do they propose to find the money for State-aided purchase without disarranging and dislocating the Money Market? In the face of the recommendation of Lord Haversham's Committee, do they propose to advance all the purchase money or not? Lastly, does Mr. Jesse Collings's Bill and do his proposals represent the Conservative policy? After the speech of the noble Viscount who sits on his left I should like to ask the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition whether it is right for the members of the great Conservative Party, with all its glorious traditions, to delude the farmers with base hopes which they know can never be realised. Ought you not to abandon the pretence that you intend to carry out a great scheme of land reform on ownership basis? I hope I may get answers to these questions. We all value the fact that the Opposition is led by the noble Marquess, who has all the old traditions of both sides of the House at heart, and to him I make my appeal. I ask him, Dc you seriously intend to adopt what
<col>372</col>
is called in the country the Verdant Green policy&#x2014;the policy of the aristocratic rural labourers' league? If not, then some one on the Benches opposite ought to have the courage to disown it. To the noble Marquess I appeal for an answer, and knowing him as I do I feel confident that the appeal will not be made in vain.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00693"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not wish to intervene for more than a moment in this debate, but many of us are grateful to the noble Duke for having raised this important question, especially those of us who have been interested in the position of sitting tenants where sales have been taking place recently. Indeed, many of us have watched the deliberations of the Departmental Committee with much interest, and have looked forward to the Report that they were about to issue, and naturally we were anxious to know what His Majesty's Government intended to do with regard to that Report. I think we may gather from this debate that certainly on two points we find general agreement. One is that there is an increasing amount of land coming into the market, and the other that the position of the sitting tenant, in consequence of the sale of land, is precarious.<lb/>
The noble Lord the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Agriculture seemed to belittle the danger accruing to the sitting tenant, and relied rather upon Paragraph 16 of the Report. But, my Lords, it cannot be denied that the fact that land is changing hands is a danger to the sitting tenant. It may be a small one, but it is there; and the question of dispossession is not the only danger the sitting tenant has to face. The change of landlord may be an equal danger. A man who has farmed for many years under what we may call a beneficent landlord would look askance at the idea of coming under some unknown person who may purchase the land. I am quite certain, from the sitting tenant's point of view, that the danger arising from a change of ownership is quite as great as dispossession. Therefore it is important that he should in some way or other find relief from that anxiety. I agree with the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, in thinking that some system by which money could be advanced for the purchase of his holding by the sitting tenant need not necessarily mean a general system
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0212"/>
<col>373</col>
of ownership throughout the country&#x2014;although if some sound financial scheme were brought forward which would enable a general system of ownership to be extended throughout the country, I, for one, would welcome it.<lb/>
But we are not here this evening to discuss the question of ownership as against tenancy. We are here to discuss the position of the sitting tenant when the land that he is farming is going to change hands, and I was disappointed, I must confess, with the lines indicated by the noble Lord as those upon which the Government were going to act on this question. It is small comfort to the sitting tenant to know that all that is held out at the present moment is an extension of the notice to quit. It is a small boon, I admit. I think there is something in it. But I am certain that if you are going to make the position of the sitting tenant secure the only way you will be able to do it to his satisfaction will be by enabling him, if he chooses, to buy outright the fee simple of his land.</membercontribution></p>

When address him by his new title, will be allow me to say that although we miss his genial presence on the Front Bench opposite we are glad to think that he still takes an interest in the affairs of the Department over which he formerly presided, and to-night, perhaps it was pardonable, he fought his battles o'er again. The greater part of his remarks, so far as I was able to follow them, were directed to a vindication of the agricultural policy of His Majesty's Government. May I be permitted to point out to him that at one point, at all events, there has been a somewhat marked departure from that policy as it used to be expounded to us by the noble Marquess. I very well remember that, in one of our discussions last year, he told us clearly that he denied that the practice of charging the small holder with the sinking fund as well as rent had in any way hampered the county councils, either in getting land or in letting land for small holdings, and he ridiculed a noble friend of mine who sits behind me for bringing forward a measure which was intended to relieve the small holder of
<col>374</col>
that particular hardship. Now we find the noble Marquess explaining to us that it was atrocious&#x2014;I think that was the expression he used&#x2014;that the small holder should be saddled both with rent and sinking fund.</membercontribution></p>

There is no doubt about that.<lb/>
The Report of the noble Lord's Committee is a somewhat distracting document, but it is full of valuable matter and to my mind the fact that there was such a wide divergence of opinion between the members of the Committee adds not a little to the importance of those recommendations upon which they were unanimous. In the few observations which I mean to address to the House this evening I propose to concentrate upon what I conceive to be the real question raised by the Report of the Committee and by the noble Duke behind me, and that is the position of the sitting tenant who finds himself disturbed through no fault of his own but because his landlord has found it necessary to put the estate, or a part of the estate, into the market. There is no use pretending that the sitting
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0213"/>
<col>375</col>
tenant has not a grievance. There is a grievance, and it is a growing grievance. The sales of land reached &#x00A3;1,500,000 the year before last, and I think &#x00A3;2,000,000 last year, but it is a matter of notoriety that those figures do not by any means include the whole of the sales. There are other sales which take place privately. It is within my knowledge that one single firm of auctioneers has at this moment something like 1,500,000 acres upon its books.<lb/>
We have heard something as to the causes which have contributed to bring all this land into the market, and, of course, it is quite fair to say that the causes are more than one. Land no longer carries with it the political influence which it used to carry. I think in many parts of the country sport counts for less than it used to. Then there is, as has been truly said, an upward movement in the price of land. The noble Marquess insists upon the appropriateness of the expression "a boom in land." I should put it rather differently. I should say there was a slight recovery from a disastrous slump in land. That is very much nearer the mark. But, my Lords, the main reason for all this land coming into the market is, beyond all doubt and dispute, that, whereas at one time people were taught to believe that land was the safest investment of all, you are now teaching them year by year that it is one of the most dangerous investments to which you can resort. It used to be said that land cannot run away. No, but you can make the possession of land subject to such intolerable conditions that owners will run away from the land. The Report of the noble Lord's Committee is conclusive on that point, and I cannot help thinking that His Majesty's Government must themselves be beginning to realise it.<lb/>
My noble friend behind me, the noble Duke, has referred to the effect of the Estate Duties. But while land gets hit by the Estate Duties, as all other kinds of property get hit, land is now subject to differential taxation to which other kinds of property are not subject. There are apparently two separate lines of attack upon which His Majesty's Government have proceeded in their hostility to the ownership of land. There is, in the first place, this gigantic network of Land Taxes which we are constantly reminded
<col>376</col>
is only the beginning of what we may expect&#x2014;Land Taxes which originated with persons who notoriously look forward to the time when all taxation will be thrown upon land, and whose views have been appropriated by His Majesty's Government. That is one line of attack. The other line of attack is to be found in the tendency of all recent agricultural legislation to attach to the ownership of land conditions which render that ownership not only less attractive than it was but extremely embarrassing and dangerous. I refer to changes in the law which tend to deprive the landlord of the power of effective supervision, which deprive him of the right of free contract, and which enable an outside tribunal to decide to whom and under what conditions he is to let his land. To my mind the culminating point in that legislation was reached when in your Scottish Small Holdings Act of last year you introduced, in reference to holdings which had been managed on a system wholly different from the Irish system, conditions drawn from the Irish Land Law of the present time.<lb/>
But, my Lords, it is not only the legislation of His Majesty's Government that has created this feeling of insecurity in the minds of the landowners of this country. Landowners are constantly&#x2014;I am glad that the noble Marquess who leads the House is attending to me&#x2014;are constantly abused, denounced, held up to execration by his colleagues. You find in speeches delivered by the colleagues of the noble Marquess charges of greed, rapacity, selfishness&#x2014;charges to the effect that it is the landowners of this country who obstruct beneficent legislation and public improvements, and that it is those same landowners who have been instrumental in driving the people of this country off the face of the soil. My Lords, can you be surprised that a class which is held up to execration in this way for no other reason than that it happens to be largely interested in this particular kind of property should seize the first opportunity to get rid of, at any rate, a part of that property and should desire to substitute some other form of investment less likely to attract upon them the kind of abuse and vituperation to which they are now subject. The result of all this has been to bring about that breaking-up of estates which the noble Marquess on the Second Bench opposite
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0214"/>
<col>377</col>
(Lord Lincolnshire) apparently regards as a great blessing to the country.<lb/>
Whatever one may think as to the desirability of such a change, it must surely be evident to all of us that it cannot be accomplished without a very serious disturbance of the agricultural system and great changes affecting all those who in one capacity or another are concerned in the agricultural life of this country. It affects the owners of land as well as the farmers. It affects the labourers not a little. The noble Marquess probably knows, as I do, of cases in which labourers have been driven from their cottages by the action of the county council for the simple and avowed reason that the county council were not prepared to face the expense of providing new houses for their small holders, and in order to introduce these small holdings on the cheap actually went the length of evicting perfectly blameless people from their homes. But, my Lords, the particular sufferer whose case we are discussing this evening is the sitting tenant. The land changes hands; the person who purchases it wishes to have it for himself; he, perhaps naturally enough, has no particular sentiment for the sitting tenant, and the sitting tenant has to go. That may, perhaps, not be a great misfortune so far as the agriculture of the neighbourhood is concerned. The noble Marquess seemed to think so. But it is a great misfortune for the sitting tenant himself if he is a man who is happy in his holding and wishes to remain in it.<lb/>
I think noble Lords opposite have discovered that the sitting tenant has a grievance; but there is another discovery which I cannot help thinking is beginning to dawn upon them. They are, I hope, beginning to find out that the sitting tenant was, upon the whole, a very fortunate individual. The noble Lord who was Chairman of this Committee gave an emphatic testimony to the excellent relations which had been found to exist between the owners of land and the tenants upon it, and I do not think that is contested. After all, what has been the position of these sitting tenants? They have been partners with their landlords under very honourable and not unattractive conditions. The greater part of the capital of the concern has been found for them by their landlords, sometimes at a low rate of interest, sometimes without any charge for interest at all; and the one desire of
<col>378</col>
these people, as the noble Lord admitted, is to be let alone and to be allowed to remain in occupation of their holdings. When I heard that witness borne by the noble Lord to the manner in which these people have fared at the hands of their landlords, my thoughts travelled back to one of that memorable series of speeches delivered a few months ago by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. What had the Chancellor of the Exchequer to tell his audience about the present land system? He said it required a thorough overhauling; he dwelt especially upon the insecurity of agricultural capital; he said that money spent on land often required ten, fifteen, or twenty years to recoup the person who spent it; and then he said, "What can you expect with only an annual tenancy and one year's notice?" And he held up the miserable farmer who occupied his farm under those conditions to the pity of his audience as an ill-used and downtrodden serf. Yet when we turn to the Report of this Committee what do we find? The Committee say&#x2014;
<quote>"The evidence the Committee have received proves that tenants do not ask for leases and that they prefer to enter into a contract by which the tenancy, save in special cases, can be terminated by the usual twelve months' notice."</quote>
What becomes, then, of this diatribe of the Chancellor of the Exchequer? These dispossessed tenants are beginning to say hard things, not of the land system which was thus furiously denounced, but of the statesmen whose inexperienced hands are pulling down that land system about their ears.<lb/>
It does seem to me that there is a question which His Majesty's Ministers have got to face&#x2014;namely, what are they going to do to case the position of those farmers who are going to lose their farms through no fault of their own. A grave responsibility, to my mind, rests upon His Majesty's Ministers, because, as I have shown, it is their action which has brought these sitting tenants to their present pass. Upon what terms, then, if we desire that these men should remain in occupation of their holdings, are we to keep them? The Report is conclusive upon this one point, that if they are to remain they prefer to remain as owners rather than rent their land under the local authority. I believe you will find that to be the universal feeling of the farmers of England. They would remain under their old landlords if
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0215"/>
<col>379</col>
allowed to do so, but, failing that, they dislike the idea of occupying under the official landlordism of a public body. I hope that before this debate closes we may get some indication, a stronger indication than we have yet received, that His Majesty's Government are prepared to show a little more courage in dealing with this most important question, although I think it would be unfair to press them, so soon after the publication of the Report, for a categorical statement of the action which they might take in the direction of securing these sitting tenants in their holdings.<lb/>
The principles laid down for the guidance of the Government by the Committee are, I think, sound principles. They are enumerated in Paragraph 64 and are to this effect&#x2014;that in any arrangement for facilitating the purchase of their farms by the sitting tenants the State should be protected against loss; that the business should be conducted upon commercial lines; that the price should be a fair market price; that the tenant should be carefully selected&#x2014;by which, I suppose, is meant that precautions should be taken to ensure that none but competent farmers should be allowed to acquire their farms&#x2014;and that the farmer himself should be protected against an unduly onerous bargain. We have heard a good deal about the merits and demerits of a system by which the occupiers of land in this country would be converted into owners of their farms. I am bound to say&#x2014;and here I feel much sympathy with what was so well said by the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn&#x2014;that I fully realise the great danger of anything like a wholesale and indiscriminate measure of that kind. But I do put it to His Majesty's Government that it would be perfectly possible to do something for the relief of the particular class of people of whom we are talking to-night without committing yourselves to anything like a wholesale and indiscriminate measure of land purchase. The dangers of a wholesale creation of small holders owning the farms which they occupy would undoubtedly be immense, not only financially, but because you probably would find yourselves saddled with a great many tenants who might be quite unable to hold their own when placed in an independent position. In this case, however, you are dealing with men who are already upon the land, whose forefathers have been perhaps for generations on the land, who know what can be got out of
<col>380</col>
the land, and who are not the least likely to play tricks with it. If the four rules laid down by the Committee were carefully observed, I believe it would be possible to go great lengths in facilitating the acquisition of their farms by carefully-selected men of this class.<lb/>
The noble Marquess put to me just now a kind of catechism of questions designed to elicit from me a complete statement of the land policy of noble Lords who sit on this side of the House. We are not quite yet at the point when it will be our duty to deal with this question, and I am afraid I cannot completely gratify the noble Marquess's curiosity. But I will make one or two admissions in reply to him. I entirely agree with him in believing that it would be unwise to substitute for the present system of land tenure some vast system of land purchase under which every occupant of a farm, every person in occupation of a farm at this moment, might by a stroke of the pen be converted into a small landlord. I agree that that would be a great misfortune to the country, and it would be a greater misfortune still if by a stroke of the pen you could convert all the farmers of these islands into tenants holding their farms under county councils or local authorities of any kind. I believe the effect would be deplorable, whether regarded from a political or from an agricultural point of view. I make a further admission to the noble Marquess. I quite agree with him that the Irish analogy is not one which can be pressed when you are talking of the system of land tenure in this country. As we all know&#x2014;I have often heard it said by the noble and learned Earl on the Woolsack&#x2014;we have had in Ireland to pass through something like an agrarian revolution. We had to find a way out. Our legislation was, as I conceive, not very well devised in its earlier days; we had to find a way out, and we found one by resorting to State-aided land purchase. In Ireland, however, the agricultural system had broken down, while in this country it has not only not broken down, but it has been wonderfully successful, and it has been one which has tided landlord and tenant over extremely anxious and difficult times. I, for one, should infinitely regret to see that system disappear entirely, as I am afraid it will tend to disappear if you continue your policy of singling out land for special attack and for differential treatment. I say, then, by all means proceed cautiously;
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0216"/>
<col>381</col>
by all means remember, as the noble Lord who spoke for the Board of Agriculture told us, that you are dealing, not with the whole class of tenant farmers, but with a comparatively rare and limited class; and I believe that with regard to that limited class you may safely proceed with a certain amount of courage, and go a considerable length in offering facilities to those who desire to purchase their farms.<lb/>
I have said nothing, and I shall say only one word, with regard to the minor suggestions made by the Committee. I entirely approve of the spirit in which they are made, but I think they will require considerable scrutiny; the proper time for that will, however, be when they come to be embodied in a Bill and are before the House. I will only say this, that any changes in the law of that kind can only be palliatives, slight mitigations, of a great grievance. They do not touch the grievance itself. The only legislation which, in my opinion, is likely to go at all to the root of the grievance is legislation of a much more far-reaching kind, such as that which has been suggested by my noble friend Lord Clinton and others. This really is the question which I should like to put to the noble Marquess who will follow me&#x2014;Is it not the duty of His Majesty's Government, to whose action, remember, it is due that these men are dispossessed of their farms, to find some means of enabling them under carefully-thought-out conditions to remain in occupation of the homes from which they do not desire to be parted</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00699"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (THE MARQUESS OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lards, the noble Marquess complained of a certain degree of irrelevancy on the part of my noble friend behind me, Lord Lincolnshire. It seemed to me that as the debate has been conducted, everything that fell from my noble friend was strictly pertinent. I cannot deny that the debate as a whole has from time to time been distinguished, which is not altogether an unknown fact here, by a certain departure from the terms of the Motion on the Paper, but I am bound to say that the noble Duke began it himself, because he covered the whole field of agricultural policy, past, present, and conceivably to come, in the very interesting speech which he made. Before he sat down the noble Duke challenged me very seriously to
<col>382</col>
state what the land policy of the Government really is. As the noble Marquess behind me observed, the general trend of the land policy of the Government has been sufficiently obvious in the measures which we have been fortunate enough to pass since we came into office at the end of 1905. Speaking generally, I should be disposed to say that the condition of agriculture in this country is not such as to oblige us to consider a policy of a large or revolutionary character such as the noble Duke seemed to contemplate when he so solemnly asked us to inform the House what our policy really is. He himself offered no solution as to what the policy of himself and his friends would be if they were in a position to enforce it; but the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition, in response to an exceedingly definite challenge from my noble friend behind me, has stated at any rate various points of policy which he would not be prepared to include in any agricultural programme supposing that he was sitting on this Bench.<lb/>
I am, I think, relieved by the speeches which have been made from attempting to discuss at any length the whole situation with regard to agricultural land. It has been mentioned in almost every speech that extensive sales of agricultural land are taking place throughout the country, and various reason; have been advanced by different noble Lords to account for that fact. The noble Marquess opposite and also the noble Viscount beside him very fairly included a number of causes which they consider to be subsidiary causes, such as the diminution in the amenity attaching to the possession of land compared to what existed in a former generation, the diminution of the political influence attached to it, and also to some extent the diminution of opportunity at any rate for those simpler forms of sport with which our forefathers used to be content. But I think they might also have added what seems to me to be the strongest of all the reasons which produce these large sales in land&#x2014;namely, the prevalent desire, indeed almost the necessity which exists, to obtain a higher rate <ob/>o" interest upon any investment. The cause which induces a man to sell a landed estate is of the same character as that which prevents him from investing the proceeds in such a security as Consols. Owing partly to the greater expensiveness
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0217"/>
<col>383</col>
of life, the more costly standard of living which obtains in all classes, people are determined to get a higher rate of interest for their money; and when a man recognises that his expenses are increasing all round he begins to look at his landed estate and to realise that he is getting only a fraction of the income which he might possess if he at any rate curtailed the amount of his holding in land.<lb/>
Noble Lords opposite, however, ascribe these large sales of land, if not exclusively at any rate mainly, to the action of His Majesty's Government and to alarm as to the future which that action is causing. As to the second of those reasons I am not altogether in conflict with noble Lords opposite, because I am bound to say that the impression which they have endeavoured to create by the debates in this House and by the speeches that they and their friends have made all over the country&#x2014;that political and social changes of the most terrific character are impending, and that we who sit on these Benches have adopted and are prepared to put into force the whole Socialist theory in relation to property&#x2014;has, I have no doubt, met with a certain success in the minds of simple people, among whom I have no doubt many owners of land are to be included. The result has been, I quite agree, a certain degree of that alarm which noble Lords and their allies have done so much to propagate.<lb/>
The noble Duke who introduced this subject spoke quite fairly of the Death Duties as a cause of the sale of land. He did not attempt to saddle us with responsibility for the sale of agricultural land in respect of other provisions in the Budget of 1909&#x2013;10. But the noble Marquess who spoke last seemed to go somewhat further, and he accused us of having brought about some of the sales of agricultural land by the provisions which then became law in relation to land which is in no sense agricultural. It is very difficult to prove a negative, and I cannot say that a case may not exist here and there of a man who, finding himself bound to pay a half-penny Land Tax or facing the possibility of paying increment Duty, may there and then have proceeded to sell an agricultural estate, but the connection between the two things must be exceedingly remote. I do not see how it can
<col>384</col>
possibly be maintained that those provisions in our Budget which related to land of a quite special character have had anything to do with bringing about sales of agricultural land. Nor, I am bound to say, so far as my personal knowledge goes, can it be held, as the noble Duke seems to think, that the increases in the scale of the Death Duties which were made in that Budget, although substantial, were such, except perhaps in the case of the very largest estates, as materially to alter the position of heirs. I can only say that so far as my own experience goes I cannot recall an instance, speaking of the neighbourhood I know best, in which it is possible to associate the sale of an agricultural estate with the fears of an existing owner that his heirs might be in some difficulty with reference to the payment of the Death Duties, and I should very much doubt if such cases can be discovered.<lb/>
I think it is only fair to remind noble Lords opposite that in the whole of the discussion of the Budget of 1909&#x2013;10, and ever since, the greatest care was taken to keep apart the position of agricultural land and the position of those who owned that land from the special cases of particularly valuable urban land with which that Budget dealt, as noble Lords thought, hardly. Therefore when we come to the main point of this discussion&#x2014;namely, the position of the sitting tenant in cases where land changes hands&#x2014;I feel bound categorically to deny the statement made by the noble Marquess who has just sat down that the Government is responsible for the fact that these sales took place. They are, as he quite fairly said, due to a multiplicity of causes, but I do not believe that the action of the Government has in any direct sense been responsible for the magnitude of those sales. I now come to the main proposition&#x2014;the case of the sitting tenants where these sales take place and how their interests are to be safeguarded. I was glad to observe that the noble Marquess opposite spoke with sympathy of my noble friend's attitude as explained by him in relation to Recommendations Nos. 2, 3, and 4, and I quite agree that a close examination of those proposals had better be deferred until a Bill is introduced which embodies them.</membercontribution></p>

<col>385</col>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00701"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I must consult my right hon. friend the head of the Department before I can answer that question. The question at this moment is whether the principle of State-aided purchase ought to be admitted in these particular cases. I cannot help saying that there has been a great degree of levity in the manner in which the question of State-aided purchase generally has been spoken of by some people throughout the country. It is a question of the most tremendous gravity involving, for all one can see, a possible liability to the State of something like &#x00A3;2,000,000,000 sterling, and I confess I have been somewhat amazed and even scandalised by the manner in which people who were not altogether irresponsible have gone about the country advocating a general system of the purchase of all the agricultural land in England as though it were a matter which could be settled simply by a stroke of the pen.<lb/>
We have never on this side of the House admitted that tenant farmers as a rule desire to purchase, and that is also the view of the noble Marquess opposite, who would prefer to see the maintenance of the landlord and tenant system provided that it can be maintained on something of the existing lines. There is one objection which a great number of farmers feel to the purchase of farms, which has not, I think, so far been mentioned in this debate, and that is that on large estates the smaller men or the men who have the middle-sized farms look forward to the time when they will be able to get a larger one. That is one of the general practices on well-managed estates throughout the country, and therefore there are at any rate a very large number who would dislike the idea of being perpetually pinned down to a particular holding. I think it will be noted that those who gave evidence before this Committee and who advocated a system of purchase generally belong to the class of holders of large farms&#x2014;men who in no circumstances would desire to change to a larger farm; that is to say, they are tenants of farms of the largest class in the particular district to which they belong, and consequently I think their views on this particular point might prove to be misleading if they were regarded as the views of farmers generally.<lb/>
<col>386</col>
But as regards this particular case, there are one or two considerations connected with it which I should like your Lordships to consider. The case in which I understand it is contemplated that purchase should take place is that of a piecemeal sale of a considerable estate where land is bought in small lots and the sitting tenant becomes at the mercy of a small purchaser. But, my Lords, would it be possible, even if you wished to do so, to confine the advance of State funds, supposing you admit the desirability of advancing them at all for such purchases, to cases of that kind? Take the case of an estate sold as a whole. What guarantee have the sitting tenants got on an estate that is sold as a whole that their rents all round will not be raised? It is quite true, as the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition pointed out, that on a great many estates farms are let not merely below their extreme competitive value, but at a value which can hardly be called even a commercial value, and the fear which agitates the tenants when the land is sold is by no means always that they will be turned out, but that their rent will be screwed up at any rate to the commercial standard. When an estate is bought as a whole I take it that the purchaser, being a man of business, will often desire to recoup himself for the number of years' purchase which he has had to pay. The number of years' purchase, after all, is not fairly represented by the number of years' purchase of the gross rental&#x2014;that is to say, if a man receives the very moderate amount of twenty-five years' purchase on the gross rental of his estate he probably receives thirty-one or even thirty-five years' purchase on the net income, and therefore one cannot be surprised if the purchaser takes the opportunity of raising the rents after he has made the purchase.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00702"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Do I understand the noble Marquess to suggest that twenty-five years' purchase of the gross rental is a usual price in these days?</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0011P0I0219"/>
<col>387</col>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00705"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Yes. I have known cases where twenty-eight, twenty-nine and even thirty years' purchase of the gross rental has been paid. I was speaking of estates sold as a whole. I should like to put this to noble Lords opposite. What are you to do if in such a case one of the sitting tenants desires to buy his farm or if several of them desire to buy their farms? Why is it only to be in the case of a farm being sold singly that this advance is to be made? How are you to prevent, once the principle is admitted, its being extended to individual tenants on estates sold as a whole? Then it seems to me that you will have to extend, or may be called upon to extend, the application of the principle of State purchase to other cases where no actual sale takes place but where an estate is in the hands of mortgagees or even in the hands of an owner who remains in nominal possession but who is so hampered and embarrassed that he has to starve the estate and get as much as he can out of it. I cannot help looking at the matter from the point of view of noble Lords interested in land. If we were to make a proposition of this kind they would be tempted to use that favourite old argument of the "thin end of the wedge," because if you once begin advancing public moneys for these purposes I do not think you will be able to differentiate the particular case of the man whose rent is raised or who is given notice to quit when a farm is sold singly from a great many other cases in which the interests of the sitting tenant are injuriously affected.<lb/>
I feel sure, therefore, that while my right hon. friend will, in view of the fact that this proposition is put forward by two noble Lords so experienced as the noble Marquess and the noble Viscount, give the suggestion the best consideration in his power, he will be impressed by the difficulty, completely opposed as His Majesty's Government is to a general system of State-aided land purchase, of embarking upon it, even to the moderate extent which they suggest, in view of the extreme difficulty of suggesting securities against a much wider application of the same principle. It seems to me that the ordinary critic would say there is no doubt that a man who sits as tenant on a farm at a special rent which, owing to old associations or to the dislike of the landlord to raise rents on his estate, is a low and
<col>388</col>
altogether uncommercial one, is unlucky, and, if you like, has a grievance, if his rent is raised and he is told that he must either pay the increased rent or leave. But I think the ordinary critic not interested in land would say that though that is a hardship for him it is not a case where grants of public money for the benefit of that particular tenant would be justified. I cannot help thinking, therefore, that the subject is one which bristles with difficulties, and I am not hopeful myself of a solution being found which involves the advance of public money in such cases as these.</membercontribution></p>

<title>BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00715"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I see my noble friend Lord Newton in his place, and I venture to make an appeal to him with regard to a Notice which stands first on the Paper for to-morrow in his name.&#x2014;viz:
<quote>"To call attention to the Report from the Joint Select Committee of the House of lords and House of Commons on the Stage Plays (Censorship)."</quote>
Your Lordships are aware that there are on the Paper following the noble Lord's Notice two Motions with regard to Ireland to which noble Lords from Ireland attach considerable importance, and for the discussion of which I understand a certain number of noble Lords are coming over from Ireland. The noble Lord, it is true, had placed his Notice on the Paper in advance of the Irish Notices, but those who issued the summons to noble Lords from Ireland were under the belief that those Motions stood first on the Paper. That, however, was not so, and consequently the day is entirely at the disposal of my noble friend. But if he should find it possible, without inconvenience to himself or to those who are interested in the subject to which he desires to call atten-
<col>390</col>
tion, to put his Notice off for two or three days and allow the Irish Motions to hold the field to-morrow evening it would be greatly appreciated by those who are interested in them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00716"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it has frequently happened to me to put down a Motion and then be asked by some noble Lord, generally some one on the Front Benches, to change the day. I feel quite certain in my own mind that, if the circumstances were reversed, it would not be the slightest use my making an appeal to my noble friend to give way to me, but as I am of a much more amiable disposition I suppose I shall have to again sacrifice myself. I observed that the Notice Paper was absolutely clear of business, and thereupon, after consulting with other noble Lords and twice altering the day, I fixed upon to-morrow. Some time afterwards Lord Midleton came to me and in broken-hearted accents asked me to give up my day because a large number of noble Lords are coming over from Ireland in order to discuss a very important question. If the question is such an important one, I am surprised that they did not put the Motion on the Paper two or three days earlier. But, as I say, I do not wish to be disobliging, and if there are a number of noble Lords coming over from Ireland. I do not wish to stand in their way. At the same time, I desire to enter a protest against this practice of asking members of this House to alter their day. In this particular case, however, I have consulted with noble Lords who are interested in the question which I was to have raised to-morrow, and they have assured me that they do not mind its being postponed until next week. Therefore I will fall in with my noble friend's request, but I should like to warn him that this is the last time I shall give way.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00717"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: I am sure we are all most grateful to my noble friend for the generosity with which he has acted in this matter, but I wish to say a word on one remark which fell from him. He said that he had always been anxious to give way to members of the Front Benches. I can assure him that there is a perfectly clear understanding that no one on this Bench should ever rise when it is understood that my noble friend wishes to address the House.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00725"><b>1.</b> This Act shall extend and apply to the administrative county of London and to those parts of the administrative counties of Essex, Hertfordshire, Kent, and Surrey (exclusive of the county borough of Croydon) to which the provisions of the Disorderly Houses Act, 1751, relating to music and dancing licences applied.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00726"><member>THE PAYMASTER-GENERAL (LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS)</member> moved, after the word " of "["and to those parts of the administrative counties of"] to insert "Buckinghamshire" and to leave out the words "exclusive of " and to insert" and of the county borough of West Ham and. "The noble Lord said: The object of this Amendment and of some subsequent Amendments which are consequential is to bring within the scope of this useful piece of legislation the whole of the district included within the twenty-mile radius from the City of Westminster. I think the value of the Bill would be very much destroyed if an exception were made as to the borough of Croydon and a small piece of Buckinghamshire. The position would then be this, that there would be three Acts of Parliament dealing with this subject applying to the same district. There would be the old Act of 1751, which would not be repealed in respect of Croydon and this part of Buckinghamshire; the Middlesex Act of 1894, and then, if this Bill passes, there would be this Act. There is no reason, so far as I know, why Croydon should be treated separately, and as no argument has been advanced for such separate treatment I hope your Lordships will see fit to include the whole of the twenty-mile radius.</p>

But I wish to point out that as far as Buckinghamshire is concerned it is really a minor matter, because I am given to understand that there is not, at present at any rate, a single building in that county which conies under the Act of 1751. The reason why the borough of Croydon was left out was, as I stated on Second Reading, that the borough council had made other arrangements and did not wish to upset thorn by having, a new Act. Naturally the London County Council do not object to Croydon being put into the Bill, but it is possible that at another stage of the Bill the authorities of Croydon may petition against it if they are now included.</membercontribution></p>

If this subsection is cut out it is possible that a considerable amount of extra work may be placed on the County Council committee and the officials.</membercontribution></p>

The noble Earl said These two Amendments are really of a drafting nature. It is considered that without these Amendments it would be possible for an interval to exist between the termination of one licence and the granting of another. Supposing the annual meeting was held on November 15 this year and was not held next year until, say, the 20th; in that case every single house which had received its annual licence would be without that licence from the 15th to the 20th, and every one of them would accordingly be considered a disorderly house. It is in order to get rid of that interval between the two licences that I propose these Amendments.</p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00777"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: Before this clause is added to the Bill I should like to say a word, because I do not wish the noble Lord in charge of the Bill to be under any misapprehension as to the view of the Government upon it. This clause imposes certain fees payable to the licensing authority in respect to the premises licensed. It is true that in the Middlesex Act of 1894 a small fee is payable, but this clause goes far beyond anything in that Act, and for the first time imposes a sub-
<col>396</col>
stantial fee payable by the licensee to the authorities. There is a good deal to be said for this, because no doubt the authorities are put to considerable expense and will no doubt be put to additional expense under this Act. I believe it is stated that as large a sum as &#x00A3;6,000 or &#x00A3;8,000 is annually spent upon the inspection of licensed premises. At the same time, I think it must be borne in mind that the inspection of these theatres is more in the interests of the public than of the theatrical proprietors or managers, and it is questionable whether that expenditure should not be borne out of the general rates rather than be thrown upon the individual. Moreover, this is quite a substantial fee. I do not know what view the Exchequer may take of it. It is conceivable that at some time a Chancellor of the Exchequer may wish to tax places of amusement, and in view of that I do not know whether it would be wise for us at this stage to grant, as it were, to local authorities such sums as might be derived from this species of taxation. However, I have not put down any Amendment upon this, but I reserve to the Government the right, after consideration, if they see fit, to move in another place to amend at any rate the amounts which are specified in this clause.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00778"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL STANHOPE</member><membercontribution>: I hope His Majesty's Government will not follow the suggestion which has been outlined to the House by the noble Lord, because, as I stated on a previous stage of the Bill, the fees charged under this clause will not cover one-half of the cost of inspection. The cost of inspection is put at over &#x00A3;8,000&#x2014;that is, the cost of architects going into the question of safety and the cost of fire brigade officers going into the question of fire risks. What we expect to get from these fees is approximately &#x00A3;3,600, as against &#x00A3;8,000 which the inspection will cost. As to the noble Lord's remark that it is possible at some future date that the Chancellor of the Exchequer may see fit to impose taxes on places of this kind, I would suggest that these fees are not likely to be any interference with such taxation any more than was that the case with the licensing of motor-cars. Motor-cars were licensed before the Budget of 1909, but the Chancellor of the Exchequer found no difficulty in placing additional taxes upon them.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00791"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: I move, after the word " obtain " in subsection (1), to insert the words in my Amendment. The object is to retain the description " disorderly house " for such premises as are unlicensed. If that is retained as it is in the Middlesex Act it has the advantage of giving the police, if necessary, a right of entry. It also makes the person who occupies such unlicensed premises guilty of a misdemeanour which can be punished by imprisonment or unlimited fine, and the imprisonment can carry with it in some cases hard labour. The insertion of these words provides an alternative method of
<col>398</col>
procedure. If in any circumstances the local authority was slack in prosecuting houses which had not a licence it would give the public, acting through their county councils, power to obtain a warrant which would enable the police to enter and close the premises. This is an additional precaution, and I hope the noble Earl will accept it.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00793"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL STANHOPE</member><membercontribution>: The only point against the Amendment is this, that it does preserve some of the rather extreme procedure of the Act of 1751. By Section 5 of that Act proceedings can be taken against a disorderly house by a common informer. Any two members of the public can take action against the disorderly house, and if the proceedings are successful they can claim a fee of &#x00A3;10 each. Several of the borough councils in London have objected to that procedure, which they think is undignified and unnecessary. They feel that the police authorities are adequate to take proceedings in such cases, and they are therefore anxious to do away altogether with the Act of 1751 in that case. I think it is possible that in another place there may be an Amendment moved to this subsection by which the common informer will be ruled out and the municipal and police authorities given the power, which, of course, ought to be left to them, of taking proceedings in such cases.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00794">On Question, Amendment agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00795"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: Your Lordships will observe that this clause provides that a penalty not exceeding &#x00A3;50 may be exacted from any one convicted of a breach of the provisions of the Act, and that the fine is to date from the day from which the offence is committed. There is an invariable practice nowadays in all Government Departments dealing with these kind of Bills to insist that the fine should not take place until after conviction. If that is not the case, there is nothing to prevent a local authority from purposely delaying the proceedings against an unlicensed house with a view to mulcting them in very heavy damages. It is considered better now to make the fine date from the date of conviction and
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0225"/>
<col>399</col>
not from the date of the offence. I hope it will meet the view of the noble Earl in charge of the Bill if, as my next Amendment proposes, " one hundred pounds " is inserted instead of " fifty pounds " for a first offence, and &#x00A3;50 for every day following. In that way the fine is increased, but the authorities are rather put under an obligation to take proceedings at once and not let the thing remain on with the object of possibly abstracting a bigger fine.</membercontribution></p>

<title>IRISH FINANCE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00826"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask the Lord Privy Seal whether it is intended to publish the Report or evidence, or both, of the Committee on Irish Finance, having regard to the early introduction of the Home Rule Bill and to the consequent need for authoritative and expert opinion and figures being available to Members and the public upon the financial relations of Great Britain and Ireland; whether the contents of the Report, or any part thereof, or its general import, have been shown or communicated to any member of either House of Parliament, except Ministers, or to any other person, and, if so, to whom.<lb/>
This Question is no novelty to those who have studied this matter. Questions of a similar character have been frequently put to His Majesty's Ministers in the House of Commons, but the replies have always been of an unsatisfactory, and, I think I may say, of an evasive character. I may remind your Lordships that it was in March last, at Oxford, that the Chief Secretary announced that an inquiry was to be held with regard to the relations between English and Irish finance, and that it was to be of a purely confidential character and for the benefit of the Cabinet solely. That Committee called a number of witnesses and made its Report to the Government last autumn. I fully admit that if His Majesty's Government intended to bring in a Home Rule Bill&#x2014;which in all probability will lead to the absolute ruin of finance in Ireland&#x2014;it was their duty to appoint a Committee to inquire into the financial relations between England and Ireland. But the Committee reported now some months ago, and as we are told that a Home Rule Bill is to be introduced into the House of Commons during Easter week I cannot understand why the Report should not be made public. Before the introduction of the Home Rule Bill and afterwards there will be discussions of an important character in Parliament, in the Press, and on public platforms. Consequently, I think it is the duty of His Majesty's Government to give every facility to those who will take part in those discussions of knowing what is contained in the Report of this Committee. I think it is the bounden duty of His Majesty's Government to let the country know the basis on which they have founded the financial proposals which will appear in the Bill shortly to be introduced.<lb/>
<col>402</col>
I can quite understand that up to the time when the Home Rule Bill is prepared His Majesty's Government should consider the Report of the Committee confidential, and, I might even say, of a secret character; but now that the Bill is about to be introduced I maintain that the confidential nature of the Report is entirely removed. The Committee in question was appointed and discharged its duties at the public expense, and as the public has had to pay for the information obtained by the Committee I maintain that the public has a perfect right to obtain the Report made by the Committee to His Majesty's Government. I gather froth the answers of the Prime Minister in another place that the Government have not finally made up their minds not to publish the Report. On February 19 the Prime Minister said he could not yet say what the eventual decision as to the publication of the Report might be; and again, on March 6, the Prime Minister replied in the negative to a question whether we were definitely to assume that he undertook not to publish the Committee's Report. Mr. McKenna, on February 27, said it would be contrary to precedent to produce the Report of this Committee before legislation. From that answer it is gathered that the Government will not be unprepared to publish the Report after the introduction of the Home Rule Bill. I should like to ask the noble Marquess whether it is intended to give the Report to the public before the introduction of the Home Rule Bill, whether it will be issued in the course of the discussions of the Bill, and, if not, what grounds they have for keeping the Report back from the public. I hope to have direct answers to those questions.<lb/>
But I hope to have an even more direct answer to the latter part of my Question. I have no doubt that His Majesty's Government considered the Report of a secret and confidential character, but there are rumours that the details of it have not been confined to the members of His Majesty's Government. Reports are abroad that other people have seen the Report. That rumour has gained a certain amount of credence owing to the evasive answers which have been given by the Home Secretary in another place when questioned on the matter. The Home Secretary was asked whether the Report had been shown to others than to His Majesty's Government, but be fenced
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0227"/>
<col>403</col>
entirely with that question. Therefore I have to ask the noble Marquess whether it is the fact that the contents of the Report or any part of it, or its general import, have been shown or communicated to persons outside His Majesty's Government, and if the noble Marquess replies in the affirmative I can only say that it is most unjustifiable to show the Report to nonofficial individuals when they refuse to show it to people in the House of Commons who are entitled to ask for it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00827"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (THE MARQUESS OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Marquess has told us that Questions similar in character to that which he has just asked have been put more than once in another place, and he does not consider that the replies which have been given are satisfactory. I fear, however, that I shall not be able to-day to go beyond what my right hon. friends have said elsewhere. This inquiry, as has been already stated, was a purely confidential inquiry for the purpose of assisting His Majesty's Government in framing a Home Rule Bill, and upon His Majesty's Government the whole responsibility must necessarily rest for the particular financial proposals as well as for all the other proposals which they embody in that measure when it is presented to Parliament. I therefore cannot see any reason, and I know of no precedent which would help the noble Marquess, in urging that the Report of an inquiry of this kind should be published before the Bill is read a first time in the House in which it is introduced. It seems to me that you might almost as well ask for the publication of the various drafts upon which a Bill is framed, sometimes, as noble Lords who have been responsible for Bills know, greatly differing in their details and even sometimes in their principles, in order that you may be able to trace the various processes of mind through which the framers of a particular measure have passed. Therefore, so far as the immediate publication of this Report is concerned, there seems to me to be no case for it whatever.<lb/>
As to its ultimate publication, I am not in a better position to speak than my right hon. friends in another place. I cannot say that it will be published. I certainly am not going to say that it will not; but, if it is, it is impossible for me now to tell the noble Marquess at what stage of the
<col>404</col>
discussion it will be produced. But I can safely say that the particular considerations which the noble Marquess urges as to the need for authoritative information on certain financial matters so far as they would be advanced by the publication of this Report will certainly carry due weight with His Majesty's Government. I cannot help thinking that there has been a confusion in the minds of some people between the character of this inquiry and the large inquiry by Royal Commission into the financial relations between the two countries which was held before the last Home Rule Bill was introduced. They are entirely different in character in every respect. I have noticed that in some of the Questions that have been put to my right hon. friend in another place this Committee has been spoken of as the Financial Relations Inquiry, as though it were exactly on all fours with the wide and sweeping inquiry which was held nearly twenty years ago.<lb/>
As regards the second part of the noble Marquess's Question, that, also, has more than once been put in another place. I am not quite sure with what object this query has been put either here or on former occasions in the House of Commons. The Report is, as I have explained to the noble Marquess, of a purely confidential character. As to whether it has been shown to any other person or persons, as confidential Papers are sometimes shown in confidence, I am not in a position to speak. Honestly, I do not know, and although I am probably as much interested in the forthcoming measure as any other member of the Government, and more than some, because when it comes here it will, I presume, fall to my lot to be in charge of it, I have not made any inquiry as to whether any other person or persons outside the Cabinet have seen it. I am bound to add that even if I did know I could not answer the noble Marquess's Question, because the Report is a confidential one, and it would not be proper to state who had or who had not seen it. But I cannot think that in any case the matter is one of great importance, because, as I have already said, what is important is the responsibility which His Majesty's Government will take for the actual proposals which they will produce immediately after Easter in another place. Meantime, I am afraid it is impossible to satisfy further the curiosity of noble Lords opposite on this particular point.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00828"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: I put this Question on the Paper some days ago, and I think it is an extraordinary proceeding on the part of the noble Marquess not to have taken the trouble to find out the answer to the latter part. Speaking with great respect I venture to say that there was never a more discourteous action done by one Front Bench to another. Probably the noble Marquess knows full well that the Report has been shown to people associated with the Nationalist Party but he is afraid to say so in your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00829"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I must contradict that statement.

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00830"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: There was one remark made by the noble Marquess to which I should like to allude. He stated that the proceedings of this Committee were quite different in character from the former inquiry. The only difference in character that I can make out is that this country has since those days provided a great deal more money than it had done before&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00831"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I am sorry to interrupt the noble Earl, but my observation was directed to the fact that the former inquiry was held by Royal Commission and this was an inquiry by a small confidential Committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00832"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: What I feel in this matter is that we have not got out of the Government any statement as to whether the Report has been shown to outside persons. If this Committee had reported in a favourable manner with regard to Irish finances, and if they had reported that Ireland would be able to pay its way under Home Rule&#x2014;if they had taken an optimistic view of the result of a measure of Home Rule upon the finances of the country, we should no doubt have heard all about it. We should have been told that the Committee had been a great success, and that they had found out that everything would be all right when Ireland had got Home Rule. But we have
<col>406</col>
reason to believe that the contrary has occurred, and therefore we are told that the Report of the Committee is to be kept a secret. I hope that after the Home Rule Bill has been introduced we shall see the Report of this Committee and know exactly the opinions at which they arrived. I cannot say that the answer of the noble Marquess is other than most unsatisfactory, but we must be thankful even for small mercies. I can only repeat that if the Committee had found out that we would be able to pay our way under Home Rule we should have heard all about it before this. That, I am afraid, is not the case, and therefore the Report is to be kept secret as long as possible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00833"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am unable to agree with my noble friend who has just sat down, for I see no mercies at all to be thankful for. The noble Marquess had ample notice of the Question on the Paper, and my noble friend Lord Londonderry presented his case with the greatest courtesy and clearness. I anticipated the answer we should receive to the first part of the Question, but the noble Marquess has given no answer at all to the most crucial point contained in the latter part of the Question to which attention has been keenly directed in the Press and in conversation, and which is of the highest possible importance. The noble Marquess said he did not know whether the contents of the Report had been shown or communicated to outside persons. I ask, What business has the noble Marquess to be in that state of mind? When such a Question as this is put to His Majesty's Government by a noble Lord who fills a considerable position in reference to this question, is it not the business of the noble Marquess opposite to be able to give an answer? Why is he in a position to clothe himself in masterly ignorance? Ignorance is entirely out of place on this question. I can understand the noble Marquess saying that this was a secret Committee, but, if so, surely he should be in a position to say whether the secret was fairly observed all round, and whether when the discussion opens every one will be in a state of ignorance until the Prime Minister, who will have charge of this Bill, unfolds the secret. What is suggested is this, that it is extremely probable, if the Report has not been shown, that at any rate its contents have been communicated to ersons who do not belong to this side
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0229"/>
<col>407</col>
in politics, and that one Party greatly interested in the Home Rule Bill have been given an opportunity of knowing a great deal about the contents of this Report, whilst no information at all has been communicated to those who sit on this side and who are deeply interested in knowing the contents of that Report. Personally, I am entirely dissatisfied with the answer given by the noble Marquess. Having regard to my personal respect for him, I do not like to say it was unfair. But I think I will go as far as to say it was not fair. I do not think it is reasonable for the noble Marquess, when asked a fair question like this, to say that he is unable to give an answer on what is a most crucial point in this matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00834"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: May I say that as the noble Marquess has stated that he is not in a position to answer the latter part of my Question because he has no knowledge on the subject, I will repeat the Question on Thursday next, when I hope he will be able to give me some information.</membercontribution></p>

<col>409</col>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00838">The noble Duke said: My Lords, my present Questions arise from a discussion which took place in your Lordships' House on February 28 last as to the fitness for immediate active service of time-expired soldiers re-enlisting into Section D, which I describe as the second class of the Regular Reserve, and as to the number of men of this description required by the noble Viscount to complete the mobilisation of the six Divisions of the Expeditionary Force. It is necessary to remember, in reference to this Section of the Reserve, firstly, that for the next four years it will be composed of men who are the product of the three-years Colour service term of enlistment, and, consequently, have been absent from the Colours from nine to thirteen years; secondly, that if the noble Viscount succeeds in re-enlisting, as he hopes to do, 30,000 men out of the 40,000 due to pass out of the Reserve by October, 1913, these 30,000 men in four years time pass out of the Reserve and cannot be replaced. They cannot be replaced because the noble Viscount has diminished the Reserve-creating power of the Army by reducing the number of men serving with the Colours by 37,000 since 1905. It is this reduction in the number of men serving with the Colours which necessitates the re-enlistment of these time-expired soldiers. As a matter of fact, if it had not been for the Reserve created by the three-years term of Colour service the Expeditionary Force of the noble Viscount, which has shed such lustre upon his military administration, would have been numerically impossible even on paper. It therefore seems to me that the noble Viscount, instead of denouncing the scheme of the three-years Colour service as preposterous, ought to be deeply grateful that the plan was ever tried.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00839">The body of men in the Section D of the Reserve with which we have to deal for the next four years have been absent from the Colours from nine to thirteen years without doing any military training during the period of their four years' re-enlistment. Their musketry practice consists in two attendances on the range and in firing twenty-five rounds on each occasion. On mobilisation they will find themselves armed with a rifle of a different pattern to the one which they carried in bygone days when they were soldiering. Lord Methuen has told us that he found that this class of Reservist could not march on
<col>410</col>
active service, and has described them as more or less veterans. This combination of facts proclaims them at once as unfit for active service on the Continent with the Expeditionary Force within three weeks of mobilisation. The noble Viscount has not quoted any military authority to prove that such is not the case. The question is, How many of these re-enlisted Reservists, unfit for the duties assigned to them by the noble Viscount, must he include in the ranks of the Expeditionary Force? Upon that point the noble Viscount was reticent, on account of the secrets of mobilisation. Now the numbers of our Army are matters which must be, and are, within the knowledge of the public. I ventured to say, therefore, in my reply to the noble Viscount the other day, that I would put on the Paper of the House the figures with which we have already been supplied bearing upon the point. This I have now done. I propose to take the headings separately, and if the noble Viscount in his reply found it convenient to follow the same course I hope we may be able to understand why these War Office figures point on mobilisation to a very narrow margin in the Reserve, whereas we know that the noble Viscount reckons on an abundant surplus.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00840">The estimated strength of Sections A and B of the Regular Reserve in 1913 is 106,372; the number resident abroad is 8,230. Necessary allowance for wastage at 10 per cent. is 9,814. These headings need no explanation. The next deduction is 3,729, the number of Reservists required to bring the four home battalions and all other Regular units at home up to war strength. The four home battalions represent the backbone of the swiftly moving central field force upon which, according to the noble Viscount, we can rely with such certainty. These battalions, as well as the other Regular units, must be made up to war strength by 3,729 Reservists, who, being wanted at home, cannot be available for foreign service.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00841">My next heading is 1,650 combatant Reservists who have transferred from the combatant ranks to serve with the Royal Army Medical Corps on mobilisation. I read in the Army Annual Return for 1912 that the full number of 2,000 Infantry Reservists who had been invited in 1909
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0231"/>
<col>411</col>
to transfer to the Reserve of the Royal Army Medical Corps have not yet been obtained. However, 1,650 have been obtained, and it is certain that if these 1,650 men are withdrawn from the fighting line their vacant places must be filled by a similar number of combatant Reservists. My last deduction is 6,467 men, the number required to complete the deficiency in Category B of the Special Reserve. Category B is composed of men who are returned as supernumerary to the Territorial Army and who have undertaken to join the Special Reserve on mobilisation and to serve abroad. They are an absolutely essential part of the Expeditionary Force, which will be incomplete without them. We heard a great deal about them-once; we do not hear much about them now. The establishment is 7,448. The deficiency shown by the Army Estimates of this year 1912&#x2013;1913 is as follows&#x2014;Army Service Corps, deficit 5,513; Royal Army Medical Corps, 420; Army Veterinary Department, 524.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00842">To sum up. The allowance necessary for wastage, the number of Reservists required for home Regular units, the number transferred to Army Medical Corps, and the number required to make good deficiencies in Category B amount to 21,660. The result, then, is that there are left available for the Expeditionary Force 76,482, but as 90,000 are required there is a deficit in Sections A and B of 13,518. This deficit of 13,518 represents the number required from Section D to complete the mobilisation of the six Divisions. In the Table dealing with Section D I would only say, as to the second heading, that the War Office allowance of 10 per cent. for unfitness amongst time-expired Reservists is contrary to common sense, because it is the same rate which is found necessary for soldiers serving with the Colours. It is more likely to be 30 per cent.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00843">The only other heading requiring any notice is the fourth&#x2014;namely, the 9,840 time-expired soldiers required by the noble Viscount to complete the establishment of his Special Reserve battalions. I have already mentioned this point in your Lordships' House. The noble Viscount appeals to time-expired soldiers to enlist both into his Special Reserve battalions and into Section D. The supply of time-expired Reservists is limited to the number
<col>412</col>
who pass out of the Reserve in any one year. Of course, all men who enlist in the Special Reserve battalions, and the noble Viscount has assured us that few men go to Section D, must be lost to Section D. Finally, according to the War Office figures I have quoted we are to be left in 1913, after the departure of the Expeditionary Force, with less than 1,500 Regular Reservists available for the Army overseas, and those of the second class. The noble Viscount told us on May 4 last that he would have, in the event of mobilisation in 1913, a surplus of 27,000. I beg to move for Papers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00844"><sup>*</sup><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Duke has laid before the House a Table, which he says is compiled from statements made by myself and by the Under-Secretary in the House of Commons and from Returns, showing what he considers will be the state of things as regards the mobilisation of the Expeditionary Force should that take place in the year 1913, and he has added to that a further Table showing the number of men in Section D who will be available for the purposes of the Expeditionary Force. The noble Duke laid a similar Table before the House last May dealing with practically the same subject. I always treat the views of the noble Duke with profound respect, so I referred that Table to the department of the Adjutant-General, and I brought before the House the result of their Report, which was that the Table contained a trifling error of a little over 32,000 men. On this occasion I congratulate the noble Duke. I have referred his new Table to the department of the Adjutant-General and have got a further Report from them, and this time the error is not anything like as great.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00845"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member><membercontribution>: I would point out that the figures are not mine. This is not my Table; it is the War Office Table.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00846"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Duke has misunderstood and quite unintentionally misrepresented the War Office figures. But, as I say, I congratulate him because on the present occasion the error is reduced to a trifle over 18,000 men, which is an improvement. This is a very
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0232"/>
<col>413</col>
dry and tedious subject, but I think I shall be able to put shortly before the House the points which have misled the noble Duke. The noble Duke started off with the Return which was made in response to a Motion by Lord Erroll in 1909, and he has taken the figures as they appeared at that time. For instance, he says that 106,372 is the estimated strength of Sections A and B of the Regular Reserve in 1913. According to that Table, that is quite true. We said at the time that we were dissatisfied with that state of things, which arose from the outgoing of the nine years enlisted men. It was only temporary, because the Table itself shows that the numbers went up afterwards. In order to meet the shortage at that time, or at any rate the small numbers at that time, we said we would resort to measures which we have since taken and which I have explained on former occasions to the House. We have allowed, in the case of suitable battalions where recruiting was very good, a considerable number of men to go to the Reserve before their time, and the result is that&#x2014;not because the old Table was wrong, for it was based on the then existing state of things, but because of the new state of things&#x2014;the figure to-day is not really the figure which the noble Duke has taken from the 1909 Report.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00847"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member><membercontribution>: Can the noble Viscount give us the figure? The figure of 106,372 is the one on which we have worked for some time past.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00848"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Duke has worked on it, but we have since then taken extensively the step of enabling men to pass prematurely to the Reserve when the state of recruiting was so good that the shortage in the battalions was easily made up. In that way we have increased the Reserve by several thousands.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00849"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member><membercontribution>: Will the noble Viscount give us the figure?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00850"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: I can obtain it for the noble Duke if he likes, but we have increased the figure by several thousands. My point is that it is misleading to take the figure of 106,372, what at best is merely an actuarial estimate, as if representing the ascertained facts. The next point is the figure of 3,729, which was the
<col>414</col>
number of Reservists required on January 1, 1910, to bring the four home battalions&#x2014;that is to say, the unallotted battalions&#x2014;up to war establishment. For very much the same reason that is an unreliable figure, and constantly changing. It is different now from what it was then. I will give the noble Duke a Table which will enable him to see where he has gone wrong.<lb/>
Then the noble Duke speaks of 1,650 Infantry and Royal Garrison Artillery Reservists transferred to the Royal Army Medical Corps. He has deducted these as not being available for the purposes of the Expeditionary Force. But these should not be deducted, as they are part of the establishment of the Expeditionary Force. They are included in the 90,000 required for the Expeditionary Force, and the noble Duke has counted them in that way twice over. They are in the 90,000, and you cannot have them twice over. That is a mistake. But there was a much larger mistake in the noble Duke's last Table. The next point is this. The noble Duke puts the deficiency in Category B of the Special Reserve at 6,467, based on the 1911&#x2013;12 establishment. If the noble Duke had looked at the establishment in the new Estimates for 1912&#x2013;13 he would have found that it was 5,210, and not the figure he has given, and that the strength on February 1, 1912, was 988 all ranks, leaving a deficiency of 4,222. As, however, 680 out of that number are not required for the Expeditionary Force at all, the actual deficiency on Expeditionary Force requirements is 3,542, which, as we have already explained, will be made up by specially enlisted men.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00851"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member><membercontribution>: Will the noble Viscount explain what he means by specially enlisted men? Does he propose to enlist these men at the moment of mobilisation?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00852"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: Yes; and I should explain that we have made considerable changes in the system of transport. The transport used to be horse transport. It has now become in large measure mechanical transport, and the drivers, instead of being horse-drivers, will be men specially trained in the driving of these mechanically-propelled wagons, some of which we are building and others of which we are subsidising. We are making special arrangements for enlisting skilled motor-drivers.
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0233"/>
<col>415</col>
That is what I mean by specially enlisted men. The number of Regular Reservists available, admitting that the other figures used by the noble Duke are approximately correct, therefore becomes 84,599 <i>plus</i> the men who join Section B on premature conversion of service, and not 76,482. Then, finally, the full number of 9,840 time-expired Reservists to be enlisted into Special Reserve battalions instead of into Section D has been misunderstood by the noble Duke. Those are in addition to and not in substitution for Section D men, since they will be men of an age who will already have finished their time in Section D if they ever contemplated joining that Section of the Army Reserve.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00853"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member><membercontribution>: Does the noble Viscount mean that the man must go to Section D before he goes to the Special Reserve?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00854"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: Not necessarily. The age fixed for the Special Reserve is higher. Men are going into the Special Reserve at a higher age than into Section D.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00855"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member><membercontribution>: May not these men go into Section D in preference to going into the Special Reserve?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00856"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: Some men will not go into Section D because it does not suit them to take the obligation attached to that section.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00857"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member><membercontribution>: Then the noble Viscount has a competition between Section D of the Regular Reserve and the Special Reserve?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00858"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: There is an abundance of old soldiers in the country and an enormous source from which to draw men, and we are not conscious of any difficulty in that direction. With regard to the figures in the noble Duke's Table, I have here a Table corrected in accordance with the criticisms which I have made, and the effect of it is that, instead of the state of things shown by the noble Duke, a very different state of things is disclosed. The noble Duke makes out that we would have to use up Section D men to such an extent in order to mobilise in 1913 that there would only be a surplus of 1,486 left over. According to the corrected Table, the
<col>416</col>
surplus left over is not 1,486 but 19,483. I will hand this Table to the Official Reporter to be added to my reply, so that the noble Duke may examine it.&#x2020;<lb/>
There is only one thing I should like to say in conclusion. I do not interfere in any way with figures made out on the responsibility of the Adjutant-General's Department. But I did suggest to the noble Duke before, and I make the suggestion again, that it is really impossible for any person who is not trained to the work and has not the materials for making out Tables like this to do it efficiently. The noble Duke falls into these mistakes not from want of zeal&#x2014;we all know with what public spirit he has applied himself to this&#x2014;but he obviously could not possess the materials for making out such a Table. I suggested before that when he prepared a Table again he might send it to me or to my private secretary or direct to the Adjutant-General, and I promised that the Table would be returned to him with the observations of the Department upon it and accompanied by a cor-

rected Table, and if that had been done we should have been saved two or three debates in this House on figures, which are very unprofitable. The noble Duke pours out figures like a torrent, and then I trickle forth a number in response, and I am afraid the result is not very profitable.

It is a quite unreliable figure to stand by, because it changes for the reasons I have given&#x2014;that in the case of many battalions men pass prematurely to the Reserve and the Reserve of those battalions is larger than it would otherwise have been.

<title>NATIONAL INSURANCE ACT<lb/> REGULATIONS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00871"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask why the Regulations made in pursuance of the National Insurance Act, 1911, and laid upon the Table, have not been printed and circulated, and to move that all such Regulations shall in future be printed and circulated. Your Lordships will recollect that a very important part of the administration of the Insurance Act passed last year is left to Commissioners by means of Regulations. The Act also stated that certain of those Regulations were to be laid on the Table of both Houses of Parliament, and that if either House adopted an Address against any one of them the Regulation was to fall. Several Regulations appear to have been made provisionally; they seem to have been presented, but further than that this House has no cognisance of them at all. Regulations were laid as long ago as February 14; another was laid on February 22 and another on the 27th, and the twenty-one days given to Parliament in which to consider these Regulations have been running since that time. The Regulations have not been printed and circulated, and therefore if things are to continue like this there will be no possibility of checking or scrutinising the Regulations which the Commissioners make.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0235"/>
<col>419</col>
This question was raised in 1910 by the late Lord Onslow, and the noble Marquess who leads the House and Lord Sheffield and one or two others all took the same view&#x2014;that when an Act says that a certain period is to be given to the Houses of Parliament in which they may consider Regulations, that period should be a real period, and that the Regulations themselves should be presented to Members and they should have an opportunity of looking at them. There are, of course, different kinds of Acts of Parliament. Some Regulations are ordered to be laid on the Table which, perhaps, may not be so important, but in this particular case the Regulations are of exceptional importance. It is most desirable, indeed it is absolutely essential, that all of your Lordships should have an opportunity of looking at them and of taking any action with regard to them that you may think necessary.<lb/>
Now we come to the question whose fault this is. It is very difficult to say, because the Minister who presents the Regulations apparently does not use the mystical words that they are "to be printed," and because he does not use those words, according to the practice of your Lordships' House, they appear not to be printed. When questioned on the matter the Minister naturally says he was not aware that it was necessary to use the words that they should be printed. Therefore that is his excuse. Then, on the other hand, we come to the regulations of this House. The practice of this House, I must say, appears to me to partake of red tape on particular occasions, particularly with regard to the words "to be printed." When you present a Bill, if you do not use the words that it be printed, although you present it and have it read a first time it is never printed. However, the important thing is this, that with regard to the Insurance Act at all events it is most important that your Lordships should see these Regulations and should have an opportunity of considering them during the twenty-one days on which they lie upon the Table of the House. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00872"><i>Moved</i>, That the Regulations made in pursuance of the National Insurance Act, 1911, when laid upon the Table be in future printed and circulated.&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Camperdown</i>.)</p>
<col>420</col>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00873"><member>THE EARL OF LIVERPOOL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the facts of the case are exactly as the noble Earl has stated them, but I think I can in a few words state what has happened as regards these Regulations. It is true that they were printed in the House of Commons but not in this House. I am given to understand that when Regulations are printed by one House of Parliament they are not printed by the other; and in this case they have not been printed by this House. These particular Regulations were not circulated in the House of Commons, and they have not, as your Lordships know, been circulated here.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00874"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: But they are to be found in print in the House of Commons.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00876"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I asked for a copy the other day and could not get one. I was told that there were no printed copies.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00877"><member>THE EARL OF LIVERPOOL</member><membercontribution>: There are, I know, copies to be obtained in the Printed Paper Office, though they have not been circulated. The Regulations were mentioned on the Pink Paper which is sent round to your Lordships, and any noble Lord who desired a copy could have had it sent to him if he had requested it. This really resolves itself into a question of expense, and an enormous amount of expense would be involved if all Regulations were printed by both Houses of Parliament. Every noble Lord has a right to move that particular Regulations should be printed and circulated; but I understand that the Regulations in question are available at the Printed Paper Office in your Lordships' House to any noble Lord who asks for them, and the Treasury will be glad to give any other Papers with regard to this Act.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00878"><member>THE CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES (THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE)</member><membercontribution>: I should like to say a word with regard to one statement that was made by the noble Earl Lord Camperdown. In the case of Bills which are presented and read a first time it is not necessary for the Peer introducing the Bill to move that it be printed. It is printed and circulated as a matter of
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0236"/>
<col>421</col>
course. I believe that is the only form of circulation&#x2014;the circulation of Bills&#x2014;which the house does of itself.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00879"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SANDERSON</member><membercontribution>: I would venture to call attention to what appears to be a curious anomaly in the practice of this House. Every time a scheme for a professorship at a University or for a change in the scheme of a college or even a grammar-school is laid on the Table of your Lordships' House it is printed and sent round with the Votes, whereas Regulations of the importance of those referred to by the noble Earl, Lord Camperdown, are not circulated. Sometimes we get notice of important Regulations in the Pink Paper, though sometimes we do not.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00880"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: The practice referred to by the noble Lord on the Cross Benches (Lord Sanderson) has, I think, often struck us as involving something of an anomaly. It is true that the schemes which are regularly circulated to us are by no means always of universal or even of wide interest, whereas in particular cases some Papers, such as the one in question, which are not regularly circulated are of greater interest and importance; but it has been and remains the custom of the House to print and circulate everything which can be described as a scheme, whereas Regulations are not as a rule circulated or even printed unless the House so orders. I should have considerable hesitation in adding either to the expense which would be involved or to the mass of printed matter which your Lordships would receive by suggesting a universal and general printing and circulation of all Papers which might conceivably be printed, and I confess that I am not clear as to any method by which the difficulty to which the noble Earl has drawn attention can be met except by the readiness of individual Peers to ask in particular cases for the printing and circulation of Papers in which they are specially interested. That would certainly involve no small degree of watchfulness on their part, and even something of a prophetic gift in knowing that the twenty-one days, or whatever the period would be, were approaching during which the Papers would have to lie on the Table. But I own that I am not prepared to ask the House to agree to a general printing or circulation of all such Papers. Neither am I prepared with any system by which those
<col>422</col>
of special interest to a considerable number of peers can be automatically forthcoming. In those circumstances I confess I do not see that there is very much to be done. In this particular case I understand from my noble friend that copies of the House of Commons print are now available in the Printed Paper Office here. I hope that that may satisfy the noble Earl so far as this particular case is concerned, although I fully appreciate that he may not feel quite satisfied unless some adequate suggestion is made for dealing with the question as a whole.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00881"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I do not think my noble friend, or any one else who sits on this side of the House, desires to suggest for a moment that all Papers, no matter what their importance, should be circulated. That would, no doubt, occasion a great deal of unnecessary expense. Besides, we are always able, if we pay any attention to the Pink Papers which are circulated from time to time, to ask for a particular Paper if we desire to have a copy of it. But the case my noble friend has in view is rather a different one. He is talking about Regulations issued in order to give effect to a very important Act of Parliament. The tendency in these days&#x2014;I say it with all possible respect&#x2014;is to shirk a great many of the minor difficulties of legislation and to deal with many points of detail in Regulations, which are really parts of the Act itself. Whenever that takes place I think the House is entitled, as a matter of course, to be supplied with copies of the Regulations in due time. That is what my noble friend presses for, and that, I think, we should all of us like to see carried out.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00882"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I am not very fond of the argument of <i>tu quoque</i>, but I should like to remind the noble Marquess the Leader of the House of what he said in the year 1910 when this same question came up. He then said&#x2014;
<quote>"With regard to the general question of the laying of Regulations I have no hesitation in saying there could not possibly be two opinions that when it is provided in an Act of Parliament that a Regulation should be laid on the Table of either House or both Houses during a fixed time that period should be a real period, and that the Regulations should be available during the whole of it."</quote>
I entirely concur with that, and if the noble Marquess will look at my Motion he will
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0237"/>
<col>423</col>
see that I have limited it to the Insurance Act. There is no doubt that in this particular Act exceptional powers are given to the Commissioners, and it seems to me most desirable that your Lordships should have every opportunity of seeing the Regulations in sufficient time to enable objection to be taken to any of them with which noble Lords may not agree. How we are to obtain information as to when these Regulations are laid on the Table raises a point of difficulty. I think Lord Liverpool said that the fact that they had been laid was set out on the Pink Paper. I generally look at the Pink Paper, and there are one or two noble Lords near me who do so, but none of us recollects seeing any reference to these Regulations. That is all I can say. With regard to the general practice, I believe it is this. Once in every week a Pink Paper is issued containing a notice of every Regulation which is lying on the Table, but if your Lordships do not happen to look at the Minutes on that particular day in the week you have no opportunity of seeing the Pink Paper again for another six days. I hope that your Lordships will insist on this occasion on these particular Regulations being invariably printed and circulated.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00883"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Perhaps, by the indulgence of the House, I may be allowed to say that I certainly do not depart in any way from the opinion quoted by the noble Earl, which is that during the time that Regulations of any substance are lying on the Table of the House they should be at the disposal of anybody who wants them. I do not think that that necessarily involves their circulation in all cases to the whole House, although I have no doubt the noble Earl thinks that in this case circulation ought to have taken place. Whether or not the notice respecting these Regulations appeared on the Pink Paper I am not from personal observation in a position to state, but I quite agree that it should have so appeared in a case of the importance of these particular Regulations. It would, of course, I may remind the House, have been open to anybody during the discussion on the National Insurance Bill when it was in the House to have expressed the opinion that the Bill was of a character which would justify an order for circulating the Regulations under it, and I have no doubt it would have been done. It is not altogether easy to say upon whom the
<col>424</col>
responsibility is to lie of saying that certain Regulations are of such general importance that we ought to go to the not inconsiderable expense of circulating them. In this particular case it might no doubt have been done, but some other case may occur in which other noble Lords will rise with indignation at not having seen certain Regulations which, on the other hand, may not be of acute interest to a great many other noble Lords. Therefore, although in this particular instance, if the noble Earl desires it, I have no wish to oppose the instruction that these Regulations should be printed and circulated, I cannot promise that in some future case some noble Lord will not complain that certain Regulations in which he is deeply concerned have met the same fate as these&#x2014;namely, that they were only able to be obtained on application at the Printed Paper Office.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF BENGAL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00885"><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask the Secretary of State for India&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>1. Whether it is a fact that the Chief Justice of Bengal is drawing a pension as Retired Chief Justice of Bombay as well as the full pay of his present post; and if so</li>
<li>2. Whether there is any precedent (<i>a</i>) for an official of the Indian Government drawing pay and pension at the same time; or (<i>b</i>) for a retired official of the Indian Government, who has accepted an appointment in the Council of the Secretary of State for India, returning to India to take up a permanent official appointment.</li>
<li>3. What were the circumstances in which the extraordinary departure from custom involved in the appointment of the present Chief Justice of Bengal was considered justifiable.</li>
</ol></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00886"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord opposite has placed three Questions on the Paper with reference to the appointment and the present position of the Chief Justice of Bengal, Sir Lawrence Jenkins. The first Question is whether it is a fact that Sir Lawrence Jenkins is drawing a pension as Retired Chief Justice of Bombay as well as the full pay of his
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0238"/>
<col>425</col>
present post. The answer to that is that it is the case that Sir Lawrence is in receipt of a pension which was earned by his Judicial service in India from 1896 to 1898, and that he is receiving that pension in addition to his salary as Chief justice of the High Court of Calcutta, where he went in March, 1909. The rules relating to the salaries of Chief Justices and other Judges of the High Court in India are of a statutory character made by the Secretary of State in Council under powers given to him by Act of Parliament, and they have, therefore, the same effect as though they were actually embodied in an Act. Therefore they are in no way affected by the ordinary rules as to pension which govern the usual Civil Service appointments in India, as the noble Lord will appreciate. As the rules stood in the year 1909 they did not provide for the suspension of an existing pension in the case of a former Judge who was reappointed to a Judicial office in India. Since then the Secretary of State in Council has made a rule taking power to decide in any future case of the kind whether the new salary ought or ought not to be reduced in consideration of the holding of a pension by the Judge in question.<lb/>
The second Question is whether there is any precedent for an official of the Indian Government drawing pay and pension at the same time, and, secondly, whether there is any precedent for a retired official of the Indian Government who has accepted an appointment in the Indian Council in London returning to India to take up a permanent official appointment. As the noble Lord is well aware, retired officers whose pensions do not fall under statutory rules, if they are reappointed to another position, either have their pension held in abeyance altogether or partially held in abeyance while they are serving, or else they are liable to have the salary of the new post which they occupy reduced. On the other hand, it is not forbidden to receive a pension for past services as well as the pay of any office from Indian revenues. For instance, as the noble Lord will, I have no doubt, have considered, members of the Council of India receive salary from Indian revenues, but they also receive the pensions which they have earned by service in India&#x2014;it may be Civil, it may be Judicial, or it may be military. In fact, Sir Lawrence Jenkins was himself a case in point, because when he was serving on the Council while Lord Morley
<col>426</col>
was Secretary of State he was drawing the salary of a member of Council and also the full pension of a retired Judge. On the second point which the noble Lord mentions there is no rule, and I think it cannot even be said that there is a custom preventing the return to India to an official appointment of a retired Indian official who has held an appointment in the Council of India. There was a case not so very long anterior to the appointment of Sir Lawrence Jenkins&#x2014;the case of a distinguished Indian official, Mr. J. F. Finlay. This gentleman was in the Indian Civil Service from 1875 to 1903. He then came home to England and sat on the Council of India from 1903 to 1907, and in the latter year he returned to India as an ordinary member of the Council of the Governor-General. That, I think, disposes of the particular point raised by the noble Lord.<lb/>
Then the noble Lord, in his last Question, asks, "What were the circumstances in which the extraordinary departure from custom involved in the appointment of the present Chief Justice of Bengal was considered justifiable?" I have shown, I think, that in essentials and arguing from analogy the appointment was not so extraordinary as the Question would lead one to suppose. Sir Lawrence was not appointed in my time, although I have the honour of knowing him well and hold the same opinion of him as was held by those who actually appointed him. But it was undoubtedly the case that he was considered by my noble friend Lord Morley and by the noble Earl, Lord Minto, to be the most suitable person to appoint to the then vacant, office of Chief Justice of Bengal in virtue of his quite remarkable ability, his exceptional legal knowledge, his Judicial experience, and his knowledge of India. I ought to add that Sir Lawrence, far from in any way applying for the post, did not desire it, and he only accepted it in deference to the strong wish of my two noble friends Lord Morley and Lord Minto, who were exceedingly anxious to secure his services; and it was as a matter of fact, as I am informed, both an inconvenience and something of a real sacrifice to him to take up the appointment at the time he did. I hope that the replies which I have been able to give to his various Questions will satisfy the noble Lord as to the character and the propriety of the appointment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00887"><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: I am greatly obliged to the noble Marquess for having replied so fully, and I only beg permission to put a supplementary Question. Have I clearly understood the noble Marquess that this appointment, so far as its financial aspect is concerned&#x2014;and I was only concerned with that&#x2014;is regarded as an undesirable precedent, and that a new rule has been established which will make it impossible in the future that a man should be drawing pay and pension at the same time in India?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00888"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord must not draw from what I have said quite so far reaching a conclusion as that. What I said was that a rule had been passed by the Secretary of State in Council which would make it possible for the Secretary of State in such case, supposing another to occur, to consider what it was not possible for him to consider before, whether any, and if so what, reduction should be made from the salary of the post in consideration of a pension
<col>428</col>
being already held by the officer appointed. But I would not say that it might never occur in special cases that a man might be allowed both to enjoy his pension and to receive the full salary. It would not, however, be an absolutely necessary sequel of his appointment, as it was in the case of the present Chief Justice of Bengal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00889"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: I hope the noble Marquess will guard himself in that respect, because I have myself in another Department found extreme difficulty arising from the fact that an official who had a small pension from one part of the public service and was ready to take a not very lucrative employment was unable to take the post because the law of this country is so strict against the holding of pay and pension together. I think there are cases, as the noble Marquess says, in which the Secretary of State ought to have some latitude.</membercontribution></p>

<title>CONGESTED DISTRICTS BOARD AND<lb/> MR. FITZGIBBON, M.P.</title>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00899"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member> rose to call attention to the working of the Congested Districts Board in Ireland, and to speeches recently made by Mr. John Fitzgibbon, M.P., at Williamstown, County Galway and Ballindine, County Mayo, and to the statements of the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland thereon; and to move, That a humble Address be presented to His Majesty praying him to remove Mr. John Fitzgibbon, M.P., from his office as one of the members of the Congested Districts Board appointed under Section 45 of 9 Edw. VII, ch. 42, on the ground that he has abused the same and been guilty of misconduct therein incapacitating him from the due and proper discharges of his duties.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00900">The noble Viscount said: My Lords, the Motion which I have ventured to put upon the Paper this afternoon speaks for itself as showing the seriousness which is attached by many of us to the state of things which has arisen with regard to a certain member of the Congested Districts Board in Ireland. Nobody can appreciate the true importance of this Board unless he considers for one moment what were the circumstances under which the Congested Districts Board was placed ill possession of its present powers, and what are the great powers which this Board has to administer and in which any individual member of the Board is specially interested. We have had in the course of the last forty years very drastic legislation with regard to land in Ireland. We have seen a new system set up of judicial settlement of rents by a public authority; we have seen the interest of the tenant, which was previously to a large extent involved in the landlord's occupation, defined; and we have seen the power taken away from the landlord to resume his land at his own option. But never until the Act of 1909 was it laid down by Parliament that any man should be compulsorily deprived of the power of retaining his own property over a large portion of Ireland if such a course seemed to an authority which the Houses of Parliament set up to be to the public advantage.</p>
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0241"/>
<col>431</col>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00901">Your Lordships will recollect that very grave debate took place upon that measure, and more especially on the congested districts clauses of the measure. As originally proposed, it had been intended that an elective element should be found on the Congested Districts Board, and I think I am not going beyond what even the Government would support in saying that that proposal was riddled in debate in this House. It was felt to be absurd that a large number of people who were themselves interested in the sale of their holdings to the Government and in the improvement of their position should themselves elect members of the tribunal which was to act fairly and judicially between the two parties; and in the end, after great discussion and considerable friction between the two Houses, an agreement was arrived at, for which I think the noble Marquess the Leader of the House made himself on the whole responsible, that provided we gave up our very grave doubt as to the right of any tribunal to take from any body of men the whole of their property, as was proposed under the Bill over six counties in Ireland, they, on the other hand, would undertake that the nomination of the Congested Districts Board should rest, not with the people, but with the Lord Lieutenant, and that the Lord Lieutenant would appoint thoroughly impartial as well as practical men.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00902">We are face to face to-night with the question of how that pledge has been carried out. Recollect that we came to it rather reluctantly, and that from this part of the House it was questioned even whether we should not lose the Bill if we could not obtain the safeguards which we desired and well might have desired, because the whole of the counties of Donegal, Leitrim, Mayo, Kerry, Sligo, Roscommon, and Galway and the six congested districts of Clare and the six congested districts of Cork wore handed over, at one single stroke, to the power of the Board to recommend, the Estates Commissioners to confirm, and the Government to take compulsorily from every man the whole of his possessions in land except the demesne land, and that at a price to be fixed, no doubt, by a Judge of the High Court, but without appeal on price&#x2014;a system which I think has never found its way into any Act of Parliament before.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00903">Now, my Lords, what were the points on which we specially desired to safeguard
<col>432</col>
the system in order to make it effective? May I say that I do not wish to make any general attack on the working of the Congested Districts Board. Nor do I desire to say anything as to the manner in which the Chief Secretary exercises his other rights of nomination. I pass that by without comment. I am most anxious that nothing to be said to-night should tend in any way to hamper the work of the Board. I believe that what was uppermost in the minds of every one of us on this side of the House when we made the great concession to which I alluded a moment ago was this, that despite all the sacrifices made of rent in Ireland, despite all the improvements to be shown by every kind of statistic in the position of the tenantry throughout a large part of Ireland and the consequent prosperity which had arisen&#x2014;despite all that, we felt that all the legislation and all the activity of this House and the other House of Parliament might go without adequate result if still in these congested district counties there were left problems with which no individual landlord could hope to deal, which could only be to a large extent resolved by a sound policy, broad views, and the application to some extent of public money. But that very contention on our part which caused Mr. Balfour's Government originally to set up the Congested Districts Board, which caused its extension under the present Government, had three objects&#x2014;first, to enable the poorer tenantry who are on uneconomic holdings to be provided, as far as possible, with economic holdings; secondly, to maintain the industries, and among them the cattle industry, which are all important to the welfare of the districts; and thirdly, to create that spirit of confidence between all the parties concerned which an entirely independent and impartial authority might be able to maintain in resolving a question of this kind, and which spirit of confidence it is my business to show your Lordships to-night has been rudely shattered, and it is only, in my opinion, by the Resolution which I suggest and by an Address to His Majesty that one can hope to restore that confidence without which the whole work of the Congested Districts Board will be rendered null and void.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00904">It is a little difficult to follow what was in the mind of the Government when they made the nomination which I now venture to question. The noble Marquess and his
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0242"/>
<col>433</col>
colleagues talk of an impartial Board; they talk of broad views, of duties with regard to property, and of bringing both classes together. Really if the matter were not so serious I would say that I wonder that they permitted themselves the grotesque appointment which, looking to the past and with the information then at their disposal, they made when they asked Mr. John Fitzgibbon to be a member of the Board. I have not the slightest desire to rake up old troubles about anybody, but I am bound to state to your Lordships what was known of Mr. Fitzgibbon at that time and to show that his career, both before his appointment to the Board and since, has shown an undivided and constant progress in the same direction&#x2014;a direction which the warmest partisan could not call one of impartiality or of respect for the property with which he had to deal.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00905">Mr. Fitzgibbon suffered a sentence of one month's hard labour in 1887 for inciting to the Plan of Campaign. That trait in his character bus been reproduced in the last few months. In 1888 he was arraigned on a charge of criminal conspiracy. The matter was referred to the High Court, and he suffered a term of four months' imprisonment for that offence. In 1907 Mr. Fitzgibbon showed iris strong views as regards the Government of the country under a Sovereign by declining to take the oath which is required of every Justice of the Peace. I do not wish to attribute to him views which he does not hold, but at all events that fact is a significant one. From 1907&#x2014;two years before the Bill under which he was appointed&#x2014;he had been not merely forward but foremost in the county of Roscommon in advocating those extreme measures of cattle-driving which have gone far to ruin a most prosperous industry and have created a degree o of disorder which has been a disgrace to the Government of the country. In 1907 Mr. Fitzgibbon, by his own showing, had been instrumental in intimidating the lands lords. Speaking at Ballintubber in May, 1906, he said&#x2014;
<quote>"They had brought the landlords to the ground, and by the same weapons they would force the ranchers off the plains of Roscommon."</quote>
On February 24 of the following year, at Creevemully, County Roscommon, he said&#x2014;
<quote>"They had eleven months' farms in the district and they should see that the occupiers had neither ease nor peace till they gave them up."</quote>
<col>434</col>
On August 30, 1907, he said&#x2014;
<quote>"At all events by the 1st of May of next year we will see a regular race of eleven years' men&#x2014;</quote>
that is, my Lords, the graziers&#x2014;
<quote>"off all the lands in this district on to Elphin. You never saw before such a chase as we will have."</quote>
It appears by his own showing that this doughty champion of the rights of the people not merely intimidated the landlords and graziers&#x2014;we have heard of such cases before&#x2014;but he also claimed, in a speech which he made at Tulsk on August 30, 1908, to have done what I think no member of this House will claim to have done&#x2014;namely, to have successfully intimidated the then Under-Secretary, Lord MacDonnell. It appears that Lord MacDonnell incurred the displeasure of Mr. Fitzgibbon. He was suspected of having used the Congested Districts Board in order to facilitate migrants coming into congested districts, and Mr. Fitzgibbon said&#x2014;
<quote>"When a person in the neighbourhood of Castlerea was threatened with this system, in a personal interview with Sir Antony MacDonnell he defied him to migrate 'congests' to it, and the Congested Districts Board did not carry out their first intention. Sir Antony had left Dublin Castle, so there was no harm in telling upon him. He thanked God that the English garrison was fast dying out in that country. There were only a few landlords in Roscommon who had not yet sold out, and these were in what Mr. Redmond called the condemned cell&#x2014;only waiting for their sentence."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00906">Mr. Fitzgibbon, having successfully intimidated the Under-Secretary, then flew at higher game; and a few months afterwards at Ballinameen, on January 10, 1909, he claimed that he was the originator of cattle-driving in the county, and such being the case he asked the people to put up their weapons for the present and give Mr. Birrell a chance. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"Mr. Birrell had taken up the post of John Fitzgibbon and was himself a huge cattle-driver in Ireland."</quote>
We have been of that opinion ourselves on this side of the House, but we never knew that that view was adopted and shared by the very men whom Mr. Birrell has always carefully guarded himself from admitting that he in any way assisted or countenanced. What renders all this much more serious is that Mr. Fitzgibbon himself, in a speech made at the same time, claimed that this was not only his action but it was an action dictated by the heads of
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0243"/>
<col>435</col>
the Irish Party, of whom he was the agent. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"He did nothing on his own responsibility; he acted under discipline whenever he acted, and his advice was not to heed any man who did not act under discipline and who acted without consulting his leaders."</quote>
He added&#x2014;
<quote>"When cattle-driving was taken up I went to my leaders for instructions, and they told me what to do."</quote>
That plainly shows that here is a man who claims to have intimidated the landlords, to have intimidated the graziers, to have intimidated Lord MacDonnell, and to stand as an equal authority with the Chief Secretary, whom he was willing to give a chance because the Chief Secretary had adopted his policy&#x2014;he does all that with the full sanction and authority of the leaders of the Irish Party, and then we are told that with that record he is the right man, within a few weeks of all these actions and statements, to put as an umpire in a judicial position to carry out the most drastic and powerful Act which this House has ever passed with regard to the owners of land. There was a famous remark of Henry VIII with regard to the Fitzgerald of that day&#x2014;
<quote>"If all Ireland cannot govern the Earl of Kildare, then let the Earl of Kildare govern all Ireland."</quote>
It appeared to be the opinion of the Government that, If all Connaught could not deal with Mr. Fitzgibbon then let Mr. Fitzgibbon deal with all Connaught. And that power, so far as the power could be placed in the hands of one man, was placed in his hands.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00907">I cannot believe that the noble Marquess who leads the House was aware of what the Government intended when he made the speech he did here in November, l909. At the same time I would remind the noble Marquess that he specially introduced Mr. Fitzgibbon to the House on that occasion. He quoted him with approval; he justified some of his opinions, and went as far as to say that Mr. Fitzgibbon, the chairman of the Roscommon County Council, was a man who&#x2014;
<quote>"undoubtedly holds strong opinions and expresses himself strongly, but is a most popular and important person in that neighbourhood."</quote>
A most popular and important person! And within two months the Chief Secretary proceeds to put this popular and important person into a position of trust which, as
<col>436</col>
I will now try to show your Lordships, he has greatly abused. A few months after his appointment Mr. Fitzgibbon joined a meeting at Westport, where Mr. Dillon was the chief speaker. Mr. Dillon made a speech with which I need not trouble the House, but it went to show how little he was in sympathy with the settlement which the Government desired, because he specially argued that no landlord who sold compulsorily under the Act had a right to a bonus, although the bonus under the Act was strictly devised so as to help those who sold at low prices and to prejudice those who demanded a high price. But that is not the point. Mr. Fitzgibbon, following Mr. Dillon, said&#x2014;
<quote>"The landlords in the West appeared to think that they should get twenty-one and twenty-two years' purchase for their smaller estates. He was in Connemara sometime ago and was asked by a priest what he thought of it. 'Well' he said ' I am a draper, and at the end of every piece of cloth there is what they call a fag-end, and fag-ends are generally sold at a very small price, and I think many of your estates in Connaught ought to be sold at fag-end prices.'"</quote>
What was the result of that speech? Within a few weeks, even a few days almost, there was practically a refusal to pay rent on one of the largest estates in Connaught&#x2014;the estate of Lord Sligo, which is at Westport, the place at which Mr. Fitzgibbon spoke. Trouble has been continual on that estate ever since. It is an estate of over 100,000 acres, and certainly one in regard to which your Lordships would have hesitated more than in any other in handing over the whole power of disposing of it to anybody without the consent of the landlord. That speech, which has not been made the subject of a Question to the Chief Secretary, seems to me, as much as any of those which have been made the subject of Questions, to show an absolute want of judicial spirit and an absolute determination to induce trouble as a means of buying this estate at a lower price than it would properly command, and it was therefore in the highest degree a departure from the principle on which the Congested Districts Board was intended to act.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00908">About eleven months afterwards Mr. Fitzgibbon delivered a speech at Williams-town which it is obviously impossible to defend. The Chief Secretary in the House of Commons did not defend it. Mr. Fitzgibbon himself did not defend it. He quite admitted that it was a speech which he
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0244"/>
<col>437</col>
had no right to make and which he said he made in a moment of excitement. I only make a quotation from it in order that your Lordships may see that the case is a formidable one in regard to that speech. Mr. Fitzgibbon said&#x2014;
<quote>"For thirty years they had been engaged in attacking formidable landlords. They had succeeded in beating them well, and he thought himself if the tenants on the Johnston estate were really in earnest they would not have much trouble in whipping their landlord. If Mr. Johnston did not take their offer and take the tenants' rent, they knew what he advised, and that was to put the money back in their pockets."</quote>
That is the Plan of Campaign. He added&#x2014;
<quote>"The Johnston tenants had paid until they had been told by him to pay no more.&#x2026; He was there that day to give every assistance he could to the tenants&#x2026; As a member of the Congested Districts Board he would meet Mr. Johnston's offer if he proposed to sell, and he would do his beet to get the sale pushed through. If not, he would join the tenants in their struggle."</quote>
Of course, you cannot defend such a speech as that, but he said he made it in a moment of excitement. We all know that in American law it is sometimes argued, when a man has committed a crime or misdemeanour in a moment of excitement, that he was suffering from " brain storm," but Mr. Fitzgibbon's "brain storms" seem to be permanent and constantly active. It was only on December 4 last that the Chief Secretary apologised in the House of Common" for Mr. Fitzgibbon's conduct, and got his promise not to offend again. But on December 23 Mr. Fitzgibbon took the warpath at Ballindine and made a still worse speech. This time the speech was at the expense of the noble Lord on the Cross Benches, Lord Oranmore. Apparently Lord Oranmore was told that if he wanted war he would get plenty of it. Mr. Fitzgibbon said&#x2014;
<quote>"Much as he honoured being a member of the Congested Districts Board for the purpose of doing good for the people, he very much more valued the confidence of the people."</quote>
Recollect, my Lords, that Mr. Fitzgibbon is a Member of Parliament and that these proceedings are not unaccompanied by advantage in the matter of votes from those persons to whom these exhortations are addressed. This is what is meant by valuing more the confidence of the people. He proceeded&#x2014;
<quote>"It was not for the honour of the position that he was on the Hoard, but rather for the purpose of helping to carry out and complete the great work begun by Michael Davitt."</quote>
<col>438</col>
Nobody will say that that was a judicial work, however highly they may praise Mr. Michael Davitt. Mr. Fitzgibbon proceeded&#x2014;
<quote>"Every member of the Board was alive to his duty and anxious to acquire the land for the people, but they could only deal with the land as it was brought to them, and it remained for the tenants themselves to assist in bringing the land to the market."</quote>
That is as clear an incitement to withhold rents to make trouble in order to lower values as was ever addressed to a body of tenants by a responsible individual.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00909">I dare say the Government may ask me what effect these wild speeches have had. I venture to say that in the time it would have been impossible for them to have had much more effect. I should like to spare your Lordships further quotations. But on January 23 there was a meeting held at Ballindine to carry out Mr. Fitzgibbon's plans. Posters were put up, "War to the graziers"; "If you renew your tenancy you will get no quarter. Woe be to him who hears this warning and does not heed it." A further meeting was held with Mr. Fitzgibbon in the chair, and he then said&#x2014;
<quote>"To put the matter in a nutshell, the grazier must go. So far as this particular grazier is concerned he must go. If he does not, we will drive him to-morrow if necessary."</quote>
The Chief Secretary, in his answer to a Question on this subject in the House of Commons, said there had been no intimidation. I am informed that all these graziers were, visited and were told by the League that they must go; and at a meeting of the Ballindine blanch of the United Irish League on February 14 the following resolution was passed&#x2014;
<quote>"We are determined on expelling any member of the League who does not abide by and respect the findings of the league."</quote>
I have seen a report, duly authorised, that as a fact something like 600 acres in this district are now derelict. At a further meeting of the same branch of the League on February 23rd they said&#x2014;
<quote>"We reiterate our determination to compel all men having land under the eleven months' system to vacate it, and to immediately take steps to deal with any man not so consenting."</quote>
On March 1 there was a meeting at Ballindine of from 1,000 to 1,400. Mr. Fitzgibbon had undertaken not to attend any more meetings or else to resign his position. That was the undertaking which the Chief
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0245"/>
<col>439</col>
Secretary gave in the House of Commons a fortnight ago. How has Mr. Fitzgibbon kept it? He did not himself attend this meeting on March 1, but he sent an emissary, Mr. Conway, to organise a continuation of the policy which he had himself started there. He sent an organiser of the League to this place on March 1 in order to have carried out the very policy he had undertaken to refrain from advocating.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00910"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: Where was that?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00911"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: I take the statement from the <i>Mayo News.</i> It was reported in various papers. I will let the noble Lord have the report in a few minutes if he desires it. On March 8 the <i>Freeman's Journal</i> reported that exciting scenes were witnessed the previous day on the Johnston estate near Williamstown. Over thirty policemen had to attend; there was a large crowd and a riot; stones were thrown, and the police had to draw their batons; there was a general m&#x00EA;l&#x00E9;e. And the whole of this occurred on the estate in regard to which Mr. Fitzgibbon had made his ill-omened speech about three weeks ago. I do not think it will be necessary for me to bring any further evidence to persuade your Lordships that this is not only a grave but an urgent state of affairs&#x2014;urgent for interposition if we do not want the beneficence of this Act to be brought to nought in the course of the next few weeks by the expulsion of the graziers, by the intimidation of the landlords, and by the cessation of all kinds of agreement between the parties whose estates have to be dealt with.<lb/>
I have ventured to put in my Motion on the Paper the words that Mr. Fitzgibbon has abused his office. I think the citations which I have given prove, not merely that he has abused his office, but that he is abusing his office and intends to abuse his office as long as he remains a member of the Congested Districts Board. I think that while it is serious enough that a man who has strong, I might even say vindictive, views with regard to the relations of landlords to their tenants should be put in a position of such authority, it is still worse when you put a Member of Parliament&#x2014;for Mr. Fitzgibbon is Member for South Mayo and has become so since his appointment&#x2014;in a position to offer a pecuniary bribe and advantages among his own constituents to be carried out by a
<col>440</col>
judicial authority on which he sits. I hope that I have not overstated the case when I suggest that he has been guilty of misconduct incapacitating him from the due and proper discharge of his duties. I know nothing about the rights or wrongs of the estates with which Mr. Fitzgibbon has dealt. Of course, I am acquainted with the noble Lord on the Cross Benches, but he has not made me his confidant about his estate. I know only of these things through the public Press. What I submit to your Lordships is this. Mr. Johnston may be? willing or he may not be willing, for all I know, to sell his estate, but this gentleman, Mr. Fitzgibbon, has been placed as a member of the Board which by Statute has the means of compelling Mr. Johnston to sell his estate. They can offer a price, they can agree on a price, and in default of agreement they can force him to a sale, and I say that it is misconduct for a man in such a situation, when a statutory course is provided for him, to proceed by another course to endeavour to obtain bargains by intimidation which could not otherwise be arrived at by the Congested Districts Board.<lb/>
The case of Lord Oranmore, so far as I know, is a different one. The attack made upon him appears not to be that he will not sell his estate, but that he has not sold it sufficiently quickly. He was allowed six weeks or a month or something of that kind to send in his terms. The noble Lord was endeavouring to preserve his demesne. By Statute, and for a very good reason, Parliament has arranged that demesne lands and pleasure grounds should be free from compulsion under the Act. And why? It is not merely the amenity to the landlord that is considered. It is an advantage to the district. Lord Oranmore is a resident and lives upon his estate. He employs labour largely, and Parliament would be ill-advised if it were to endeavour to get rid of those in the West of Ireland who employ labour in order to facilitate the extension of holdings over a small area. In the same sense I think we may deal with the graziers. There is machinery provided for the Congested Districts Board to take up this grass land if it thinks it right to do so. The Board holds a large amount of grass land, and at one time I believe it was the largest cattle holder in the West of Ireland. Parliament has given that machinery. What more gross misconduct can there be than for a man who
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0246"/>
<col>441</col>
has those powers under Statute and has the machinery provided to give the go-by to his colleagues, force their hands, and stultify all the legitimate action of the Board by declaring that these men shall not renew their engagements or that they shall suffer the penalty of losing their cattle&#x2014;a resort to that system which we thought we had got rid of in Ireland of creating trouble between landlord and tenant.<lb/>
The present members of the Congested Districts Board are of three classes. There are the officials&#x2014;the Chief Secretary, the Under-Secretary, and one other official&#x2014;who are <i>ex offcio;</i> there are two permanent paid members of the Board, appointed by Statute and only removable on an Address to the Crown passed by both Houses of Parliament, as in the case of the removal of Judges; the remaining nominated members, of whom Mr. Fitzgibbon is one, are nominated for five years. I do not suppose for a moment that the Government will take refuge in any <i>non possumus</i> with regard to the power of the Crown to remove a man appointed for five years. I do not want to trouble your Lordships with legal quotations, but I have been at some pains to ascertain how this question stands. It is undoubted that cases have been tried and adjudicated upon in this House, though not, I think, during the time that the noble Earl who now sits on the Woolsack has been Lord Chancellor, and it has been decided by the Law Lords without doubt that, no matter what the tenure of an office may be as regards the number of years, there, is an inherent right, power, and duty in the Crown to remove a man if he is guilty of improperly discharging his duties or of misconduct. Chitty, on the Prerogative, lays it down that it is the general Common Law Rule, upon which, however, various exceptions have been grafted by Statute, that the King may terminate at pleasure the authority of officers employed by His Majesty. As these offices are constituted for the public weal it is, he says, expedient that they should be properly executed, and a condition is tacitly and peremptorily grafted by law that they shall be exercised by their grantee faithfully, properly, diligently, on breach of which condition the office is forfeited. And in the Law Reports of 1896 there appears a judgment of Lord Herschell in the case of a man who had been appointed to the Consulate of
<col>442</col>
the Nigerian Protectorate for three years, and who sued the Crown on the ground that, having been appointed for three years, he could not be removed. Lord Herschell said&#x2014;
<quote>"The petitioner's case is that, he being engaged for a period of three yours, the Crown had no right to put an end to his engagement ay it did. The cases cited show that such employment being for the good of the public it is essential for the public good that it should be capable of being determined at the pleasure of the Crown except in certain exceptional cases,"</quote>
which Lord Herschell understood to be those of the Judges, who are placed above the Crown, for they can only be removed on the advice of Parliament.<lb/>
I think there can be no doubt whatever that the Government have the power to remove this gentleman from the position in which he has been placed. I can hardly doubt that they will be wise in time to consider what the effect has been and to redress the mistake which was made two years ago. After all, they are about to press on Parliament a measure which will give all appointments of this character to an Executive responsible to an Irish Parliament. Now I ask your Lordships, What is the use of all these professions by the Government? What is the use of the eloquent addresses delivered by Mr. Redmond at Norwich, at Banbury, and elsewhere in the months of November and December last, in which he pointed out that neither on the ground of religion, nor on the ground of class, nor on the ground on previous history and differences would any distinction be made under an Irish Executive, but that Protestants, landlords, merchants, all would be invited to tender their services, and would receive equal and just consideration at the hands of the Executive&#x2014;what is the use of those shallow professions? They surely become shallow if a man is retained in office who has notoriously shown bias throughout the whole of his transactions, who has brought on himself the censure of the Chief Secretary and is made to apologise, and has yet continued to repeat the conduct of which complaint was made. Every well wisher to the Congested Districts Board and all those who, like myself, desire to see the West of Ireland obtain that prosperity and advancement which other parts of Ireland have obtained in the last forty years, cannot but hope that the reply which wilt be made to-night will be an acceptance of the Motion which I have the honour to submit to the House.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00913"><sup>*</sup><member>THE PAYMASTER-GENERAL (LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Viscount, who has spoken in that tone and temper which habitually commends itself to your Lordships' House, has developed his thesis at considerable length. I do not suggest that he has devoted more time to it than the importance of the subject demands, but in following him I shall not feel it necessary to occupy anything like so much of your Lordships' time, especially in view of the fact that my noble friend the Leader of the House, who, of course, speaks with far greater authority on these subjects than I can possibly hope to, has intimated that he will be prepared at a later stage to join in this discussion if it should prove of general interest to noble Lords opposite.<lb/>
The noble Viscount has raised two points of very dissimilar importance. He calls attention to the general working of the Congested Districts Board in Ireland, which I think might well have been the subject of a debate by itself, and he also draws attention to an incident which, in comparison, is of a far less important character&#x2014;the incident of certain observations made by a member of the Congested Districts Board and his suitability for occupying a position on that Board. I think it is unfortunate that the noble Viscount did not devote rather more of his time to the first part of his subject, because, if he had, I think he would have found that he has indeed attached far more importance to the case of Mr. Fitzgibbon than it really deserves. The very success of the Congested Districts Board in dealing with the problems which concern it is in itself proof that Mr. Fitzgibbon's presence on the Board, and the speeches to which allusion has been made, have not prevented the Board from carrying out the work which it exists to perform. But I understand the noble Viscount does not challenge the fact that the Congested Districts Board
<col>444</col>
has performed the most remarkable feats. It has got through a great deal of work. It has dealt with a vast number of cases. Its decisions have given general satisfaction. Although the noble Viscount alluded to the fact that the Act of 1909 gave compulsory powers to the Board, those compulsory powers have never been put into operation, and although it is true that there is an appeal against the Board to the High Court, such an appeal has never yet been lodged. I think these facts go to show that, whatever may be the suitability of Mr. Fitzgibbon for the post he occupies, and whatever may be the character of the speeches which he made, neither of them has at any rate prevented the Board from carrying out the useful and important functions with which it is entrusted.<lb/>
I understand the noble Viscount to draw the especial attention of the House to the case of Mr. Fitzgibbon, and therefore it would, perhaps, be well if I were to state briefly what has happened with regard to this gentleman. As the noble Viscount said, of the fifteen members who comprise the Congested Districts Board three are <i>ex-officio,</i> two are permanent, and nine are appointed by King's Letter and are called the appointed members. Mr. Fitzgibbon is one of the appointed members. On November 12, 1911, there was a meeting held at Williamstown, in County Galway, to support the tenants on the estate of Mr. Johnston who had been decreed for rent which they were withholding for the purpose of forcing the owner to sell to the Congested Districts Board. Mr. Fitzgibbon was present at that meeting and made the speech to which the noble Viscount has alluded, and I believe, though I have not his words, that he advised the tenants to fight the landlord and not pay their rent and they would eventually win. The attention of the Chief Secretary was called to this speech, and he caused a letter to be written to Mr. Fitzgibbon pointing out the impropriety of the observations he had made; and in reply to a Question in the House of Commons the Chief Secretary stated that the attention of the hon. Member for South Mayo had been called to the reports of his speech which had appeared in the Irish newspapers, and that Mr. Fitzgibbon, while denying the accuracy of those reports, had admitted that in a moment of excitement he had said more than he had intended to say or should have said, and he had undertaken to be more
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0248"/>
<col>445</col>
careful in the future. The Chief Secretary added that no further action appeared to be necessary.<lb/>
Well, on December 17, 1911, Mr. Fitzgibbon went down to Ballindine and made another speech, in this case with reference to the estate of Lord Oranmore and Browne, and he made very similar observations. He said that he regarded Lord Oranmore as being very tricky, that his tenants had the same means at their disposal as Lord Sligo's tenants, and that if Lord Oranmore wanted a fight he could have it, and so forth. After that speech was made the Chief Secretary for Ireland wrote a letter direct to Mr. Fitzgibbon, and I think it would be interesting if I were to read that letter to the House. It is as follows, dated December 26, 1911&#x2014;
<quote>"DEAR MR. FITZGIBBON,</quote>
<quote>"My attention has again been called to speeches recently made by you, this time at Ballindine, on the 17th of this month, addressed to the tenants on Lord Oranmore's estate. On a former occasion Mr. Doran, at my request, remonstrated with you for somewhat similar utterances, and I was glad to be told that you had undertaken in the future to be more cautious in the advice you proffer to the parties engaged in the negotiation of sales to the Congested Districts Board, of which you are a member. But at Ballindine you were as bad as ever. To advise Lord Oranmore's tenants to withhold their rents and to clear the grazing lands of stock if the owner did not accede to their terms, so far from facilitating purchase by the Board would, if the advice were taken, indefinitely postpone the date of completion of any purchase, and in addition would make it impossible for the Hoard to sell their holdings to those tenants who illegally had held back their rents.</quote>
<quote>"What you call 'war' and 'fighting,' so far from helping the tenants, would injure them by depriving them of all share in the benefit of the public moneys and credit Parliament has placed at the disposal of the Congested Districts Board; and would, at the same time, add to the rates of the county for extra police.</quote>
<quote>"My main object in writing to you is to say that you cannot expect to be allowed to remain a member of the Board if you persist in making speeches of the kind to which your attention has now been called."</quote>
That letter was signed by Mr. Birrell, and on the receipt of it Mr. Fitzgibbon replied to the Chief Secretary stating that he again regretted that he had been drawn into making observations which perhaps&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00917"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: The substance of Mr. Fitzgibbon's letter was that he would refrain from making any such speeches in the future, or, if he did not refrain, he would resign his membership of the Congested Districts Board; and, so far as I know, up to the present time he has refrained from making speeches similar to those to which the attention of the House has now been called.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00918"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: He has not refrained from sending other people. He wrote informing a meeting held at Ballindine that he had sent Mr. Conway to address them as it was impossible for him to attend. Mr. Conway is an organiser connected with the United Irish League, and in his speech to the meeting he said&#x2014;I quote this from the <i>Mayo News</i>&#x2014;
<quote>"They all knew that the object of the League was to destroy graziers and landlords, and in that fight every Nationalist should be engaged throughout the length and breadth of Ireland."</quote>
I suggest that that is Mr. Fitzgibbon in another form, and I hand the newspaper cutting to the noble Lord.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00919"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: I am interested to receive, the information which the noble Viscount has placed in my hand. It is the first I have heard of it. As far as I know, Mr. Fitzgibbon has made no public utterance since he gave the undertaking to which I have referred. Is the cutting which the noble Viscount has handed to me taken from the <i>Mayo News</i> of March 9?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00921"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: If that is the incident to which the noble Viscount refers, all I have to say is that we have no knowledge of it. As a matter of fact, there was a police note-taker present at the meeting held at Ballindine, and it appears that a letter was read from Mr. Fitzgibbon regretting his inability to be present, but the letter contained no reference whatever to the organiser Conway. That is the official police information as tendered to the Chief Secretary All I can say is that the Chief Secretary has no knowledge whatever of Mr. Fitzgibbon having departed from the undertaking which he gave in his reply to the letter from
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0249"/>
<col>447</col>
Mr. Birrell. That is the position as it is at the present moment. Of course, if noble Lords opposite can substantiate such an accusation, I hope they will do so. I challenge them to produce that evidence. But I would say to them that the reports of private meetings made very often from hearsay are not to be relied upon as definite evidence as to what was said and what views were entertained by those present. The noble Viscount knows how these things get twisted in Ireland, and I suggest that before making accusations of this kind noble Lords should be certain as to the evidence with which they are supported.<lb/>
I do not suggest that Mr. Fitzgibbon's action has not been a source of embarrassment to the Congested Districts Board. There is no doubt that the observations which he made were extremely improper and, as the noble Viscount said, quite indefensible, and I think the letter of the Chief Secretary shows that he so regarded them, and that he distinctly gave Mr. Fitzgibbon to understand that that was his view. I might, perhaps, say this in extenuation, although I do not wish to lay much stress upon it, of Mr. Fitzgibbon's action&#x2014;that neither the estate of the noble Lord on the Cross Benches nor the estate of Mr. Johnston was actually under offer at the time when the speeches were made. They were not <i>sub judice,</i> so that to that extent there is some extenuation to be found, although I admit it is small, with regard to Mr Fitzgibbon's observations.<lb/>
The noble Viscount began his speech by characterising the appointment of Mr. Fitzgibbon as a grotesque appointment. I should like to consider that for a few moments. In the first place, when the Congested Districts Board was increased from ten members to twelve, and then to fifteen, it was felt that that expansion ought to include members of a representative character. Noble Lords opposite laugh; but one of the members of the Board is the noble Earl, Lord Shaftesbury, who certainly cannot be said to represent the tenants' interest. The noble Earl, if he represents any interest, represents the landlords' interest, and I think there was considerable advantage in including on the Board an individual who might be considered to represent the tenants' interest. After all, the Congested Districts Board is not a Court of Law. When you
<col>448</col>
speak of the judicial capacity of the Board, it must not be confused with a Court of Law. It is a sort of arbitration Court. Mr. Fitzgibbon is one of fifteen members, and the fourteen members are regular in their attendance, so that his influence on the Board is of a limited degree; and, as a matter of fact, anybody who has taken the trouble to look into the actual working of the Congested Districts Board will find that the ordinary proceeding of the Board is to rely to a very great extent upon the expert valuations made with regard to the estates by Mr. Doran, one of the permanent members of the Board. He presents the valuations and the Board decides whether they shall be accepted or varied. As a matter of fact, the valuations submitted by Mr. Doran have never been reduced. Occasionally, where there were exceptional circumstances, they have been increased. Therefore to suggest that Mr. Fitzgibbon's presence on the Board deprives the Board of fairness and compromises its judicial character is really to exaggerate the whole situation.<lb/>
Then there was the further point made by the noble Viscount. He hoped that the Government would not shelter themselves behind a <i>non possumus,</i> and say that it-was impossible to remove Mr. Fitzgibbon. I agree. We do not say that. But I would point out that the two permanent members of the Board who are appointed at pleasure differ from the nine members appointed by King's Letter, who hold their office for a period of five years. No doubt it is perfectly true that if any public officer is guilty of misconduct he can be removed, but that misconduct has to be proved. In the first place, I suggest that we have no legal evidence that Mr. Fitzgibbon ever made the speech which is complained of. I do not say that legal evidence could not be obtained, but legal evidence has to be obtained, and, so far, no legal evidence exists. Whether or not Mr. Fitzgibbon has been guilty of misconduct which would entitle the Crown, on the petition of this House, to remove him I will not venture to say; but I would point out to noble Lords opposite that he is not a permanent member of the Board. His appointment does not last for ever. Three years hence his appointment will automatically cease.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00922"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: What was the date of his appointment?</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0250"/>
<col>449</col>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00923"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: He was appointed on January 6, 1910, and his appointment will come to an end on January 6, 1915. On that date his appointment will naturally come under review, and that would seem to me to be a more suitable moment to consider his position. However that may be, what I would like to emphasise before sitting down is this, that Mr. Fitzgibbon's conduct has been indefensible and improper. The Chief Secretary has pointed out in unmistakable terms directly to him that he regards such speeches as he has made as inconsistent with his retaining his office as a member of the Congested Districts Board. Mr. Fitzgibbon has replied that he recognises that fact, and has given an undertaking that he will not make any such speeches in the future so long as he remains a member of the Board. That is the situation to-day; and until some fresh incident arises which would lead us to believe that there is no reliance to be placed on the undertaking given by Mr. Fitzgibbon I should deprecate any action such as that Suggested by the noble Viscount.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00924"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord who has just spoken, had a very difficult task when he was asked to meet the case presented by my noble friend behind me, and he has done so with skill and has dealt with the topic as fairly as he could, having regard to the difficulties of its nature. Mr. Fitzgibbon is a very difficult personality, whose whole life is extremely well known. My Lords, what is the Government case? It is certainly not a defence of Mr. Fitzgibbon. Any one who heard the extracts from his speeches which were read by my noble friend and who knows his public history must realise that it would be very difficult to defend all that he has said and done. On the contrary, the noble Lord who spoke on behalf of His Majesty's Government has admitted that many things that Mr. Fitzgibbon has done were indefensible and improper and have put the Government and Mr. Birrell in a position of considerable embarrassment. I could sympathise more with Mr. Birrell if he were not of full age and had not done everything with his eyes open.<lb/>
The responsibility of the Congested Districts Board is stupendous. The Board have to deal with several entire counties,
<col>450</col>
a substantial part of Cork and a substantial part of Clare, and they are given enormous powers to carry out voluntary sales and substantial powers to carry out compulsory sales. The exercise of those powers requires great conscientiousness, great balance of mind, great moderation, prudence, and tact, and the avoidance of everything that would give offence. The noble Lord who has just sat down said that Mr. Fitzgibbon had been selected as a representative. I have nothing to say against the principle of representation. It is wise and right that on a Board of this kind there should be those who represent the tenants as well as those who represent the landlords, and, if you like, the graziers. But surely the question is not whether it was right to have a representative of the people, but whether the Government should not have selected a representative who was free from all the charges that have been made to-night against Mr. Fitzgibbon. Mr. Fitzgibbon is a man of courage in expressing his opinions, a man who never hesitates to state his views. He has a perfect right to his opinions and his views, but he has also a right to be judged by those opinions and views, and I submit that the Government should have selected a man who was better known for his knowledge and moderation rather than one who was notorious for holding the most extreme views.<lb/>
My noble friend said nothing personal against Mr. Fitzgibbon; nor do I. He is entitled to be spoken of as a man of ability and a man who clearly knows his own mind; but he must have been fully aware of the responsibilities of the position that he was accepting, and I am rather surprised that he did accept the office in view of the infirmity of his position. It is quite obvious from his earlier speeches, some of which have been mentioned by my noble friend, that his views are not of recent growth. I believe he has held them as long as he has said anything in public. But when Mr. Birrell and the Government made such a risky and reckless appointment surely Mr. Fitzgibbon was bound to consider how he would comport himself in reference to his new duties, and the Government were bound to watch how he performed them without the necessity of their attention being directed to him by Questions in the House of Commons. The Government attitude, as far as I know, was to do nothing, to sit in silence until they were asked in the House of Commons whether
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0251"/>
<col>451</col>
they had read his speeches and what they thought of them. Why did they not act? I am sure that the attention of the Chief Secretary was directed to this matter in the Castle almost immediately after the speeches were made. Those speeches were reported in the Irish newspapers; they were discussed, and must have been brought to the notice of Mr. Birrell. Why did he not act? Why did he not communicate at once with Mr. Fitzgibbon and say: "This is in violation of the understanding on which you were appointed. You were appointed because we thought you would be a perfectly reasonable member of this great Board with its vast powers, and chat you would not go about preaching against payment of rent in order to intimidate and put pressure upon landlords to sell their estates."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00925"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: After the first speech the Chief Secretary wrote to Mr. Fitzgibbon, or rather had a letter addressed to him, before the subject was raised in the House of Commons.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00926"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: I am greatly surprised. That letter has not been read. I presume it was couched in such language of courtesy as not to convey any direct reprimand for what had been said, or any strong expression of opinion as to how Mr. Fitzgibbon was to behave in the future. The first letter has not been read, although the later letter has been. If the noble Lord has the earlier letter and it contains nothing that it would be improper to disclose I should be very glad to hear it read. At all events, the question was raised in the House of Commons and it was not known to anyone that the Chief Secretary objected to that speech until the question was asked. Therefore I am entitled to say that any communications that were made were not made so as to reach the public until the House of Commons was put in motion. That is not a mere verbal point. Publicity means public repudiation and public reproof, and if the Chief Secretary in his place in Parliament had intimated to Mr. Fitzgibbon that he had been guilty of conduct that was reprehensible; and which could not be allowed by His Majesty's Government, that would have acted as a caution. If I may assume from not being again interrupted that the Government are not in a position to read Mr. Birrell's first letter to Mr. Fitzgibbon, I make no further
<col>452</col>
remark upon it, except to point out that the letter seems to have had no effect. I suspect that it was a very temperate letter. At all events, it fell under the eyes of a man who felt that there was nothing in it to stop him in his course or prevent him continuing to incite tenants to act in the way that has been mentioned by my noble friend.<lb/>
The noble Lord, in the course of his reply, said that no harm had been done to the administration of the Congested Districts Board and that the Board went on doing their business, and he had no reason to think that they were not doing valuable and good work. I am very glad to hear that, but it is no answer to the indictment. Surely the essence of the case is that every man should go into the board-room feeling that he had done nothing and said nothing to prevent a perfectly fair decision upon matters coming before the Board. I do not say that any member of the Board would do anything inconsistent with the responsibility of the position he filled, but surely it is in the last degree unbecoming and improper for a member to incite tenants to take certain action in reference to property whose owner it was desired should make an application to the Congested Districts Board to purchase the property. Is there one syllable to be said in defence of that? The noble Lord in his speech did not utter one syllable in defence of it; he could not. Everything that was said in these speeches by Mr. Fitzgibbon was to the last degree improper. The noble Lord has suggested that we should do nothing, but "wait and see." We are familiar with that phrase. We are to wait until the end of the five years, and then it will be a matter for consideration whether this gentleman should be reappointed. As Mr. Fitzgibbon has not thought proper to himself resign, which he mentioned in one of his letters as a possibility, is it right to leave this great power partly vested in a man who has made such speeches? Even as lately as March 9, although he was not present in person at a meeting at Ballindine, he sent a representative who did make as strong a speech as was possible. I hope that this discussion will do good, and that it will indicate the necessity, when such appointments are made, of selecting a man who has not by public action and public speech shown the strongest conceivable bias that must prejudice the discharge of the duties of his office.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00927"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I had no intention when I came down to the House this afternoon of taking any part in this debate, but the reference which the noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, has made to me prompts me to say a few words which, I think, may be interesting to your Lordships to hear. The first occasion upon which I met Mr. Fitzgibbon was when he came to my office in Dublin Castle&#x2014;I think it was in the year 1903, or it may have been in 1904&#x2014;to talk to me about the desirability of pushing the relief of congestion in the West of Ireland. I well remember the impression which Mr. Fitzgibbon made upon me on that occasion. I never met a man who spoke with greater earnestness or more forcibly from his point of view. But if he thought that he had intimidated me upon that occasion all I can say is that he was forcing an open door, because Mr. Fitzgibbon was no more anxious to promote the relief of congestion in the West of Ireland than I was, or than was Mr. Wyndham, who was then Chief Secretary.<lb/>
The next time, if my memory serves me aright, that I met Mr. Fitzgibbon was when a difficulty arose in the county of Roscommon about purchasing grass land wherewith to relieve congestion. The spirit got abroad among the people that that land should be kept for the people of the neighbourhood, and that people removed from a distance should not be allowed to settle there. We were advised that that feeling might really interfere with and seriously prejudice the action of the Congested Districts Board, and the Board decided to send a few of their members to meet the county council of Roscommon, place before them the policy which they were endeavouring to work out, and ask their help in carrying it forward. Sir Horace Plunkett, Father Denis O'Hara, and myself, members of the Board, were chosen to go on that business, and a general meeting of the county council&#x2014;very largely attended&#x2014;was called to meet us, over which Mr. Fitzgibbon presided. I well remember the earnest manner in which Mr. Fitzgibbon addressed the county council in support of our mission, and the great help which he gave to the Congested Districts Board upon that occasion. I believe that were it not for the assistance which he gave us we should not have been able satisfactorily to carry out the duty entrusted to us.<lb/>
The next occasion, and I think it was the last, on which I met Mr. Fitzgibbon was
<col>454</col>
when I was in the neighbourhood of Castlerea, also in connection with the relief of congestion. He came to me, placed before me maps of the neighbourhood, showed me the holdings that should be relieved, and earnestly urged that we should do all we could to relieve the congestion of the neighbourhood. He was trusted by the people of the locality, and he impressed me with the belief that he was acting from pure motives, and I learned that by general repute his hands were clean in all matters connected with money. I entirely differed from him in his method of endeavouring to push the relief of congestion; but I could not help believing that he was an honest man and acting for the best from his point of view. I think it right to say this because Mr. Fitzgibbon has been accused to-night&#x2014;not without reason&#x2014;of taking advantage of his position as a member of the Congested Districts Board. But, my Lords, he lives in the congested region. He sees the daily misery of the lives of these poor people, and it is scarcely to be wondered at if, overcome by his feelings, he occasionally uses language which your Lordships and I think would be in ordinary circumstance quite improper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00928"><member>LORD FARNHAM</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, of all the cases of injustice which we in Ireland have had to put up with under the present Irish executive I think the case which has been brought to your Lordships' notice to-night by the Motion moved by the noble Viscount on the Front Opposition Bench is, perhaps, the most scandalous. Our charge against the Government in this matter can be divided into three distinct parts. First, they have deliberately appointed this Mr. Fitzgibbon to a Government Department, although they must have been fully aware of what his previous record was; secondly, they persistently keep him as a member of that Department is spite of the way in which he has behaved since he has been a member of that Board; and, thirdly, they now stand by and calmly look on while a part of the country is being plunged into a state of intimidation and unrest caused entirely by the inflammatory speeches of a member of one of their Departments.<lb/>
The noble Lord on the Front Bench opposite who answered for the Government said that the presence of Mr. Fitzgibbon on the Congested Districts Board did no harm to the Board. I wonder if having part of
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0253"/>
<col>455</col>
the country with which they are dealing placed in a state of intimidation and unrest is likely to assist the Board in carrying out the work imposed upon them. As regards the first case, Why was Mr. Fitzgibbon ever put on the Congested Districts Board at all? Why was he thought to be a suitable member of a Board which was to have the handling of enormous sums of money for the purchasing of land and the very delicate and difficult task of dealing fairly and justly between landlord and tenant? Was it on account of his impartiality as a politician? We have already heard of his extreme views, and we also believe that he previously took a considerable part in the Land League agitation. Was it because of his mild and crimeless disposition? Why, it is his proud boast that he is the inventor of cattle-driving; and we have already been told that on two occasions at least he was committed to prison for inciting to riot. Was it on account of his loyalty to the Throne? We have already heard that when he was elected chairman of the Roscommon County Council he said he could not conscientiously take the oath that would be imposed upon him on becoming a magistrate. I wonder how he has soothed the qualms of his conscience since and been able to take the oath on becoming a Member of Parliament and put &#x00A3;400 a year in his pocket. Was it because of Ids financial ability or the experience which he gained as one of the treasurers of the Nationalist Party? And with what success! for he has had to go to America and to other places to look for the money which he has been unable to raise on behalf of Home Rule in a country which is supposed to be thirsting for it.<lb/>
What, then, can be the real reason for which he was put on the Congested Districts Board? We get a little glimpse of the truth from one of Mr. Fitzgibbon's own speeches, which has already been quoted to-night, concerning Mr. Birrell being the head cattle-driver in Ireland. Perhaps some of your Lordships may remember a certain cartoon which appeared in <i>Punch.</i> It was a picture of an unfortunate cow running furiously round and round a field and Mr. Birrell sitting on top of a stile with a broad smile on his face. Beneath the picture was printed&#x2014;
<quote>"There was an old man who said ' how</quote>
<quote>Shall I stop the flight of that cow?</quote>
<quote>I will sit on a stile, and continue to smile.'</quote>
<quote>But it did not relieve the poor cow."</quote>
<col>456</col>
At last Mr. Birrell realised that he was unable to stop cattle-driving by jesting, and that public opinion demanded that it should be put a stop to. What, therefore, did he do? He went to the originator of cattle-driving and asked to be given a chance and to have cattle-driving stopped. Mr. Fitzgibbon said he was to be given a chance, but he was able at the same time to drive his own bargain, and now he is a member of the Congested Districts Board. His appointment, then, is scandalous enough. But if he is allowed to remain a member it will be still more so after those violent speeches of November 17, for which he was at first admonished, and of December 22, in which he utterly disregarded rebuke and said, amongst other things&#x2014;
<quote>"It was not for the honour of the position that he was on the Board, but rather for the purpose of helping to carry out and complete the great work begun by Michael Davitt."</quote>
That work, my Lords, was the abolition of landlordism from Ireland by means of the No Rent Campaign and by treason and felony for which he was committed to a term of fifteen years' imprisonment. If Mr. Fitzgibbon is allowed to remain on the Board after making those speeches and statements, then I say it will become a grave public scandal. So far, we have looked to the Government in vain. Mr. Fitzgibbon has again been let off with a reprimand, and you have heard to-night that he has since that made an error. But we are not informed whether the Government will take any notice of it. They say that they want positive proof. But, my Lords, you have been told&#x2014;a report has been quoted from the public Press&#x2014;that Mr. Fitzgibbon wrote to a meeting to apologise for his absence and sent a man to represent him. It is no answer to say that there is no proof when it has already been stated in the public Press.<lb/>
The next charge against the Government is that they allow a conspiracy to go on under their very noses, a conspiracy to deprive a British citizen of that which is his lawful right, and to rob him of the whole income which he derives from his Irish property. My Lords this was a conspiracy started after, and inspired by, one of the inflammatory speeches of Mr. John Fitzgibbon. I will read a quotation from the <i>Western People</i>&#x2014;
<quote>"He appealed to every man in the parish to enlist in Ireland's Army and to remain loyal and true to Irish organisation, and when Lord Oranmore
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0254"/>
<col>457</col>
heard of their strength and their unity he would be coming to Father Morris with his hat in his hand asking them to buy instead of the tenants going to him asking him to sell."</quote>
The immediate result of these words, falling from a member of a Government Department was that a conspiracy was formed to force Lord Oranmore to sell at a far lower price than he might reasonably be expected to obtain were he allowed to carry out a sale of his estate in peace and without intimidation. Posters were put up, of which you have already heard&#x2014;posters of intimidation to Lord Oranmore and to the graziers on his estate. One of the remarks on those posters was this, "We want absolutely to cut the income of the Oranmore property." Thereby they were carrying out the policy recommended by Mr. John Fitzgibbon to force Lord Oranmore to come with his hat in his hand to Father Morris asking the people to buy. And, my Lords, all this has been done in spite of the fact that Lord Oranmore has always expressed his willingness to sell at a fair and reasonable price.<lb/>
The time and money of the Congested Districts Board are now fully occupied in dealing with those estates where tenants are in the greatest need and where labour is hard to get. On the Oranmore estate it is exactly the contrary. The tenants are well-to-do. Lord Oranmore employs many labourers, and is exceptionally kind to all those in his employ. Those who do not fall into line and do as they are told are intimidated by the League. If they are proof against intimidation, then they are coerced and forced. Consequently the graziers on this property were arbitrarily summoned to attend a meeting of the League and told that they were to surrender their takes and to remove their stock from them. By way of helping them to make up their minds and obey the summons five car-loads of tenants went round and called on each individual grazier, I suppose by way of trying to gently persuade them to go quietly. To show that intimidation was used, I will refer to a meeting at Ballindine. At that meeting one of the graziers was asked whether he refused to surrender his take. He replied, "I do." His reply was followed by cries of, "Put him out," and "Throw him downstairs," and he was further told that it was as well for him to go as to be driven. And, my Lords, when the graziers have been driven out and Lord Oranmore's income and means of subsistence are gone, then he is not to be allowed
<col>458</col>
to stock those lands which will be thrown on his hands for his stock will surely be driven. At a meeting at Crossboyne a county councillor of the name of Mr. Killean stated that&#x2014;
<quote>"If Lord Oranmore grazed his property they could not promise to remain as quiet as they were now, but when the time came they would be better judges of what they were to do."</quote>
And, again, this councillor stated publicly that there would be a fund organised to indemnify them against any loss they might sustain in their herds from their patriotic action&#x2014;namely, that of leaving Lord Oranmore's service. So that Lord Oranmore's cattle are to be driven, and he is to be deprived of all his servants and his herds. Such, my Lords, is the conspiracy which the Government are now allowing to go on under their very noses.<lb/>
All our lives we have been taught to look up to the British lion of Justice with awe and respect. As far as Ireland is concerned, the lion has been muzzled and put in a cage and we are fast losing all faith in him. Here in England, no doubt, you may still respect him. If a policeman holds up his hand you stop. Why do you obey him? Because you know that he represents Justice, and that he is there to maintain law and order. But the people in Ireland are being taught to defy law and order, and the Government look on and acquiesce. The. Chief Secretary looks on as if it were all a joke. But a climax is being reached when a member of a Government Department starts a conspiracy of the nature which I have described and is still allowed to continue a member of that Department. We appeal to the Government to give us common justice. If only the Government would have less sympathy with the male-factor and give us in Ireland more justice, the country generally would in their turn extend to the Government more sympathy than they did, for instance, at the recent by-election in South Manchester. I will conclude by reading the end of the summing up of a learned Judge in a case of conspiracy exactly similar to the one which I have described&#x2014;
<quote>"There is a freedom of mind and will; there is a freedom to adopt one's own course of life; there is a freedom to trade, to buy and sell&#x2014;a freedom to buy land and to sell land. This liberty is secured to every man in this country, and part of that for which we pay our taxes is that the Government of this country shall enforce and protect this liberty."</quote></membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00929"><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think we must all be profoundly impressed by what we have heard this evening from this side of the House, and I might say also by what has fallen from the other side. One thing which emerges from this discussion is the inability of the Government to cope with the lawlessness which is increasingly apparent, and which, I think I may say for the first time, has extended to a gentleman holding an official position under His Majesty's Government. It is, indeed, rapidly becoming plain to the ordinary man that, however much the Government may legislate, they will not govern. An Administration which permits a member of an important Government Board to make use of his position to incite people to wage a private war has unquestionably abdicated its functions of responsible government.<lb/>
The noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, has moved that a humble Address be presented to His Majesty praying him to remove Mr. John Fitzgibbon from his office. After what we have heard this evening I think we are all agreed that that is a very reasonable request, and I agree with the noble Lord who has just spoken that it would be also quite reasonable to ask why His Majesty's Government did not take this step some time ago&#x2014;in fact, it would be reasonable to ask them why they ever appointed Mr. Fitzgibbon to the Congested Districts Board. Mr. Fitzgibbon may have many qualities which would lead him to eminence in some other vocation. I am quite prepared to accept Lord MacDonnell's estimate of Mr. Fitzgibbon's character. With that I have nothing to do. But I do say that it is an unprecedented act for any Government to appoint a gentleman who is notorious for his inflammatory and partisan speeches on the land question to a responsible administrative position the duties of which are almost entirely connected with Irish land and with those delicate relations which arise between tenants and landowners.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, we are not left to unassisted conjecture as to Mr. Fitzgibbon's qualifications for this post. We have only? to read the speeches which this gentleman made prior to his appointment under the Land Act of 1909 to be convinced of his extreme views. I ask your Lordships to remember what you heard this evening from the noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, and from other noble Lords with regard to those
<col>460</col>
speeches, and to bear in mind that this gentleman has been in prison twice for inciting to riot and conspiracy and that this occurred prior to his appointment to the Congested Districts Board. What other credentials has Mr. Fitzgibbon got? I believe he appeared before the Dudley Commission and gave evidence as the official witness for the United Irish League. I have no doubt that he owed his selection by Mr. Birrell to his appearance in that capacity, as I believe it is common knowledge that the United Irish League have for the last five years reigned supreme in three Provinces in Ireland, and I have no doubt that they arc in a position to bring considerable pressure to bear on His Majesty's Government in determining what appointments shall or shall not be made. When we come to the subsequent history of these proceedings we are able to judge to what extent Mr. Birrell's selection has been justified.<lb/>
I need not occupy your Lordships' time by recapitulating the seditious speeches made by Mr. Fitzgibbon at various times in different parts of the country. I think it is sufficient to observe that this matter was brought up in another place, and that in reply to a Question Mr. Birrell said that Mr. Fitzgibbon had undertaken to be more careful in future. Mr. Birrell's statement was made on December 4. What was its practical effect? We have heard this evening that shortly afterwards, I believe almost immediately afterwards, Mr. Fitzgibbon went down to a place called Ballindine, and at a meeting of the United Irish League repeated and emphasised his previous language inciting these tenants to unlawful acts. Again we had the matter brought up in the House of Commons, and a Question was put to His Majesty's Government as to whether it was their intention to remove Mr. Fitzgibbon from his official position. Mr. Birrell again gave us an example of pusillanimous procrastination. Mr. Fitzgibbon was not removed from his office. What excuse has the noble Lord, Lord Ashby St. Ledgers, put forward on behalf of Mr. Fitzgibbon? The chief defence, as far as I could make out, was that Mr. Fitzgibbon may be very, very bad indeed, but his badness will be so diluted by the excellence of the remaining fourteen members of the Board that it really will not interfere with their administrative work. That, as I understood it, was the chief defence put forward.</membercontribution></p>

Then the noble Lord went on to say that Mr. Fitzgibbon had undertaken either to refrain from making such speeches in future or to resign from his position on the Congested Districts Board. Your Lordships will observe that Mr. Fitzgibbon first of all makes no apology, neither does he undertake to refrain from making such speeches in future.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00933"><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member><membercontribution>: I quite understand the noble Lord, but, as I say, Mr. Fitzgibbon has not undertaken to refrain from making such speeches in future. He practically says, "Wait and see." Now, what must be the effect of the weakness of the attitude of His Majesty's Government, in regard to what I can only call atrocious insubordination, upon the people to whom these speeches have been made. "Never mind the law; go for what you want and get it," has been the advice tendered by a gentleman who held, and who still holds, an important official position under His Majesty's Government. I can to some extent understand the attitude His Majesty's Government have adopted of recent years towards bodies of peasants implicated in agrarian disturbances. There might be some excuse for hesitating to make use of coercive measures and for hesitating to put in force the Crimes Act for the suppression of agrarian crime in the expectation that the land purchase scheme introduced by the late Unionist Government would prove a sufficient panacea for agrarian discontent. But what possible excuse can there be for the attitude adopted by His Majesty's Government towards a person holding an important official position who makes use of that position to instigate unlawful and violent acts?<lb/>
The noble Lord has based the whole of his defence, so far as I can find, on the fact that Mr. Fitzgibbon has said that he may do better in future, and also on the fact, as the noble Lord said, that he has not done much harm. That in about on a par with
<col>462</col>
what Mr. Birrell said in the House of Commons&#x2014;that, after all, Mr. Fitzgibbon's speeches have not led to any open intimidation or to any open threats of cattle-driving. I have no doubt that technically Mr. Birrell was quite correct. I have no doubt that all that Mr. Fitzgibbon's speeches have led to is what supporters of His Majesty's Government call peaceful persuasion&#x2014;the sort of persuasion that has to be carried out, as I understand, by a deputation consisting of a numerous body of strong able-bodied men, and the sort of peace which is extracted from a terror-stricken victim who knows that he is unable to claim the protection of the law to which all citizens of a free country should be entitled. My Lords, I am not going to say more. I am unacquainted with the conditions in Ireland. But I do say this, that this is a very bad case. I think it is probably the worst case that has ever come before your Lordships' House, and I regret that nothing that has fallen from the noble Lord opposite has in any way made it a better case.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00934"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not rise for the purpose of making a speech, but merely to draw attention to one point in the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Ashby St. Ledgers. He shelters himself behind the fact that His Majesty's Government have no legal evidence as to Mr. Fitzgibbon being guilty of misconduct and therefore cannot accept the Resolution which has been moved by the noble Viscount. I do not understand what the noble Lord means by that. There have been two letters written by the Chief Secretary. One of those letters we have not heard read; but the other has been, and it told Mr. Fitzgibbon that if he continued this conduct he could not remain a member of the Congested Districts Board. There are also the newspaper extracts which have been read. They have not been contradicted by the noble Lord; he has admitted them. He has even admitted that Mr. Fitzgibbon has been in the wrong. What more evidence do we want? The Government shelter themselves behind the fact that they have not got legal evidence. Have we to go to a Court of Law to prove the case? I never heard a more ridiculous plea put forward in my life. I do not wish to detain your Lordships. I only rose to mention that one point, because it struck me as being extraordinary that such a plea should have been raised at all.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00938"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I need add very little to what has been said from this side of the House. My noble friend who introduced the subject made out, I think your Lordships will say, a very strong and unanswerable case, and that case remains unshaken at the present moment by anything that has since been said. Let me remind the House in half-a-dozen sentences of the outline of that case. In the first place, there is the history of the Congested Districts Board. What was the object with which the Board, as we now know it, was constituted? It was to be engaged&#x2014;I am using the expressions of the Chief Secretary himself&#x2014;upon "a good, noble, and pious work"; it was to be a work of reconciliation; a work designed to mitigate the acuteness of the agrarian quarrel, which was then proceeding in certain parts of Ireland. It was desired that the reconstituted body should not be of too bureaucratic a character, and accordingly representative members of various complexions were added to it. Amongst these Mr. Fitzgibbon was included. What were Mr. Fitzgibbon's qualifications for this appointment? I do not wish to do him any injustice, but I do not think I go beyond the mark when I say that, but for the fact of his being a notorious firebrand, his position is one of considerable obscurity. He takes credit to himself for having been the inventor of cattle-driving. I believe he is also very well pleased with his own record in so far as that record comprises two imprisonments for incitement to crime and intimidation. The noble Lord who represents the Irish Government told us it was desirable that there should be a representative of the tenant farmers upon
<col>464</col>
the Board. I quite agree with him. But was it necessary to look for a tenant farmer of the precise complexion of the honourable gentleman whose merits we are discussing?<lb/>
I will put an imaginary case to the noble Lord. He told us, "You have got Lord Shaftesbury, a well-known landlord upon the Board." Supposing, instead of Lord Shaftesbury, we had taken the noble? Marquess whom I see on the other side of the House, Lord Clanricarde, do you think that would have been accepted by the public as a thoroughly reasonable appointment? I think that plea, if I may be excused for saying so, was a very absurd one. I do not know with what high hopes Mr. Fitzgibbon was added to the Board, but whatever those hopes were, it is quite clear that they were rudely disappointed by his actions. He has succeeded in obtaining two distinct rebukes at the hands of the Chief Secretary. Upon the first occasion we learn that the Chief Secretary did not think it necessary to himself write the letter, but a letter was caused to be written, and in spite of the challenge from this side of the House this afternoon that letter has not been produced. I believe it is unusual and not in accordance with the practice of the House to refer to documents of that kind unless the person who quotes them is prepared to lay them upon the Table. At any rate, whatever that gentle reprimand was intended to be, it was treated by Mr. Fitzgibbon with superb contempt. Then came the second offence. Upon that occasion the reprimand was no longer entrusted to one of the <i>minores dei</i> of the Irish office; it was the Chief Secretary himself who forged and hurled the thunderbolt. What has been the result? Another apology was elicited from Mr. Fitzgibbon&#x2014;again an apology from which quotations were made by the noble Lord, Lord Ashby St. Ledgers, but which, apparently, was not fit for publication in its entirety.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-00940"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Exactly, but we should have liked to see the text of that remarkable and instructive document. What has happened since this two-fold reprimand? The noble Lord tells us that Mr. Fitzgibbon himself has held his hand. But my noble friend Lord
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0258"/>
<col>465</col>
Midleton brings forward evidence which appears to me to show conclusively that although Mr. Fitzgibbon did not personally attend these inflammatory meetings he sent a kind of deputy firebrand who for the purpose was quite as effective as himself. I would, moreover, ask His Majesty's Government to remember this, that even if Mr. Fitzgibbon stays at home and refrains from making further speeches of this description, the ball which he has set rolling is rolling still, and beyond all doubt the agitation for which he is responsible has spread to two or three counties in that part of Ireland. In these circumstances it does seem to me that Mr. Fitzgibbon's continued presence upon the Congested Districts Board is scandalously improper.<lb/>
Now I go back to the official defence offered by the noble Lord. He told us, in the first place, that there was no legal evidence of Mr. Fitzgibbon's speeches. I am sure that the noble Lord, although he was supplied with an extremely bad brief by the Irish Office, must feel that he made a bad brief worse by relying upon an argument of that kind. At any rate, whether the evidence was legally conclusive, or not, it was sufficient to justify the two-fold rebuke which we know Mr. Fitzgibbon received at the hands of the Chief Secretary. Then what was the next item in the defence? It was that Mr. Fitzgibbon has only got three years more to serve. Only three years more! Let us bear with his pretty ways in the meanwhile and allow the work of the Congested Districts Board to be hampered, as it must be, by incitements of that kind until in the fulness of time&#x2014;I think this is how it was put&#x2014;Mr. Fitzgibbon's case comes up for review, and then His Majesty's Government will consider whether or not they shall give him a further term of five years as a blessing in disguise for the country!<lb/>
My Lords, I sum up what I have ventured to say by stating that in the opinion of all reasonable men Mr. Fitzgibbon's original appointment to the Congested Districts Board was an outrage, and that his retention upon that Board is not less of an outrage. It does seem to me intolerable that a gentleman who is at the same time a high official of a Court possessing enormous powers&#x2014;my noble friend established that point at the outset of his speech&#x2014;powers in excess of those which many judicial Courts
<col>466</col>
possess, and who is also a Member of Parliament, should use his official position not only for the purpose of spreading agitation in Ireland but of strengthening his own political position amongst his constituents and those who hold the doctrines which he has professed with so much energy and with such disastrous results.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00941"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY REAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (THE MARQUESS OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as my noble friend behind me pointed out, the noble Viscount who introduced this subject devoted the greater part of his speech to the particular circumstances connected with the case of Mr. Fitzgibbon and did not touch to any great extent upon the general work of the Congested Districts Board as it is now carried on. In a few moments I shall have to say a word about that work, because it has in one aspect a distinct bearing, I venture to believe, upon the particular case which is before the House. Mr. Fitzgibbon has been the subject of some very plain speaking in the course of this debate. The noble Marquess who has just sat down did not spare him, and he was the subject of a direct personal attack on the part of the noble Lord on the Back Benches opposite; and I cannot help saying that, though I listened with no little admiration to the form of the noble Lord's speech, I could not help thinking while I was hearing it that the tone and temper of the speech as a whole, if it was to be taken as representative of the view of Irish landlords on a subject of this kind, explains a great deal the unhappy history of the last forty or fifty years in Ireland.<lb/>
Mr. Fitzgibbon's name has long been familiar to me. When I was in Ireland he was well known as an active man of the type noble Lords opposite would describe, meaning to convey the utmost blame in their power, as an agitator. Mr. Fitzgibbon was undoubtedly an agitator, and, while I say that, the term does not to me necessarily involve any blame in itself, because from the time of St. Paul downwards there have been a large number of persons who could only be described as agitators whom many of us would hold in great respect; yet I am well aware that Mr. Fitzgibbon belongs to the type of agitator whom noble Lords opposite consider to be thoroughly reprehensible. His doings were continually
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0259"/>
<col>467</col>
noted. They were almost the daily diet of Lord Morley and myself during the period when we were holding office in Ireland. But, though he was so well known as an agitator, I never remember his name being associated with any attempts of a criminal or dangerous character. I mention that because the tone in which Mr. Fitzgibbon has been described by more than one speaker in the House would lead those who are not acquainted with the history of Irish agitation to suppose that he was a well-known member of the criminal classes. As to his later history, my noble friend behind me, Lord MacDonnell, bore remarkable testimony, which I think impressed the House, as to the influence which Mr. Fitzgibbon holds in the particular counties of Roscommon and Mayo, and I think it is only fair to add that he has gained that influence partly, I have no doubt, by the agitation of which noble Lords opposite disapprove, and which certainly I am not disposed to praise, but also by having done a great deal of solid local work in his county as chairman of the county council, and also&#x2014;which may afford some amusement to noble Lords opposite&#x2014;by a trait, which at any rate here we shall all agree is in his favour in a part of the country where such efforts are, though not unknown, perhaps not very common, that of a strong worker in the cause of temperance, and as having steadily set his face, in the position which ho holds as a large general shopkeeper in Castlerea, against having anything to do with the sale of drink.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Farnham, spoke of the unrest which he described as existing at this moment in the congested districts as the direct outcome of speeches made mainly by Mr. Fitzgibbon, but no doubt he would include others who work in the same direction. I am obliged to traverse that contention although, in spite of the great benefits which were conferred on the congested districts by the Act of 1909, there undoubtedly exists a certain unrest and impatience in agrarian matters for which we have to account. I traverse it, however, to some extent by quoting from the last Report of the Congested Districts Board, which speaks of the extravagant ideas which have been entertained in the congested districts as to what the Board can do in consideration of the large increase in its income which was made in 1909, an increase of which, I think I am right in saying, noble Lords opposite themselves
<col>468</col>
heartily approved. If I remember right, the income of the Board was increased from about &#x00A3;186,000 a year to something over &#x00A3;230,000 a year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00942"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: &#x00A3;250,000, I think.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00943"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I think the noble Marquess is right. But from that had to be subtracted certain sums which had to be paid over to the Agricultural Department in respect of work taken over by them, and I fancy that the net amount is therefore about &#x00A3;230,000 a year. That increase seems to have implanted in the minds of many of those living in the congested districts the idea that the Board now possesses the purse of Fortunatus and that its transactions can be carried out, not only on a very much larger scale, but also at a greatly increased speed. I feel that it is true that a certain degree of unrest and impatience has been caused by that fact, and a certain disappointment at what is supposed to be the slow action of the Board, so that I trust that every means will be taken of explaining to the people who live in that district that, although the Board's funds are larger, yet still it can only work slowly in its practice of buying estates as a whole&#x2014;<i>in globo</i> as it has been described&#x2014;and going through the long and sometimes slow process of developing those estates and increasing the size and changing the character of the holdings.<lb/>
It has been said, and I do not think it can be denied, that there is an advantage, in such a body as the Congested Districts Board, in placing among the appointed members men of different classes, of different kinds, and representative of different interests, and it cannot be disputed that although Mr. John Fitzgibbon is not himself a farmer yet he is taken by the agricultural population in his neighbourhood as representative of their interests. Well, my Lords, if I were a member of the Congested Districts Board at this moment I confess that, bearing in mind that feeling of unrest and of what I should describe as unreasonable impatience which undoubtedly exists, I should think twice before, except for the very strongest reasons possible, I forcibly removed from the Board a man who was regarded by the tenants as representative of their interests. It is, of course, easy for noble Lords to say, and it is open to them to say it if they like, that when a representative of those interests was
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0260"/>
<col>469</col>
appointed a man of a milder disposition than Mr. Fitzgibbon and one loss given to making speeches ought to have been selected. But things being as they are, I repeat that if I were a member of the Board I should require very strong evidence of actual unfitness before I took a step which would be almost certain, if it were taken, to be misinterpreted by the very class of landholders in the West of Ireland that we wish to help and whose business the Congested Districts Board has to look after.<lb/>
My noble friend behind me stated in the fairest possible way that he had no defence to offer for the particular speeches which are complained of. Certainly I have none to advance. But there are just two points connected with the speeches on which I wish to say a word. In the course of my noble friend's speech the noble Viscount rose to explain that although Mr. Fitzgibbon had technically kept his promise of not making any more speeches, yet he had, in fact, broken it by sending an emissary to make a speech on his behalf at a meeting. As my noble friend explained&#x2014;and I think it is desirable that I should repeat the statement&#x2014;it is not believed by the Irish Government that Mr. Conway was sent by Mr. Fitzgibbon or said that he had been so sent, or that Mr. Fitzgibbon wrote saying that he had sent him. The official report contains no such statement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00944"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: I do not want to interrupt the noble Marquess, but there is a very simple process that can be gone through. Does Mr. Fitzgibbon himself deny that he had anything whatever to do with Mr. Conway's appearance at that meeting or that he had any communication whatever with regard to it?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00945"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Obviously I cannot answer that question off-hand. But, as I have stated, the letter referred to in a local newspaper describing Mr. Conway as having been sent by Mr. Fitzgibbon does not appear to have existed. Then the noble and learned Lord opposite, Lord Ashbourne, asked about the first letter of the Chief Secretary with reference to the first speech by Mr. Fitzgibbon which was complained of. That letter was not written to Mr. Fitzgibbon but to the Secretary of the Congested Districts Board, calling the Board's attention to the character of the speech, and it was the Secretary of the Board, as I understand, who wrote to Mr.
<col>470</col>
Fitzgibbon pointing out the impropriety of his conduct and who received from him a reply expressing regret and especially disclaiming any desire to embarrass the Chief Secretary and the Board. It was, as the noble Marquess stated, on the second occasion that my right hon. friend himself wrote to Mr. Fitzgibbon.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, as I said, I do not attempt to offer any defence of the speeches made by Mr. Fitzgibbon and nobody has attempted to condone them. I quite agree that all persons holding responsible positions ought not to make exciting speeches anywhere, still less ought they to make them in places where there is any risk of those whose feelings are likely to become still more excited by them taking any violent action. I hold that view, and I should certainly hold it as being responsible for the administration of India, and I should hold it as concerns the city of Belfast just as much as the County of Roscommon.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00946"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: Will the noble Marquess tell me of any speech of a dangerous character that was ever made in Belfast?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00947"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I was not speaking of speeches of a dangerous character. I was speaking of speeches made by responsible persons in any place in which feeling runs high and which may conceivably cause violent action on the part of those listening to them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00948"><member>LORD SALTOUN</member><membercontribution>: Does the noble Marquess include the Limehouse speech in that category?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-00949"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I can recall no phrase of my right hon. friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, which could drive any member of his audience to riotous proceedings. The noble Lord may have the phraseology used by my right hon. friend more accurately in his memory than I have, but I confess I am not able to recall any, and I am very glad to know that noble Lords opposite, holding law and order as they do in such great respect, disapprove, and I have no doubt will continue to disapprove, of any form of violent language used anywhere. There, I am glad to think, we are in agreement. But, my Lords, the real question, as it seems to me, is whether in view of these improper and, if you like, wild speeches that have been delivered the Government ought to decide to give the speaker a short shrift, or
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0261"/>
<col>471</col>
whether it is not wiser to give him another opportunity of showing more self-restraint. The latter of those two views is the view that His Majesty's Government intend to take. I do not believe that the cause of public order would be served or vindicated by Executive action in this case being now taken in a manner which, though for one reason or another it might give satisfaction in certain quarters, would be by a great many other people considered harsh, perhaps vindictive, and as exceeding</membercontribution></p>

In the case of an ordinary ferry with a footpath where people are taken across in a boat, there would be no occasion for anything of this sort; but there are a good many ferries worked by mechanical power, and in those cases some such provision as is contained in my Amendment is necessary. My attention was directed to this matter by a horrible accident which occurred at Devonport. A number of children were playing on the beach across which heavy chains run in connection with the ferry, and I saw the foot of a girl caught in the chain and a ghastly accident resulted which could easily have been averted if proper precautions had been taken. I have made the clause permissive, so that the Board of Trade would only make regulations where required. I made inquiries at the Board of Trade in regard to the case to which I have called attention, and was informed that they had no responsibility as the laud belonged to the Admiralty. The Admiralty also disowned responsibility.

<title>IRISH FINANCE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01018"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member> rose to ask the Lord Privy Seal whether the contents of the Report of the Committee on Irish Finance, or any part thereof, or its general import, have been shown or communicated to any member of either House of Parliament, except Ministers, or to any other person, and, if so, to whom.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01019">The noble Marquess said: Your Lordships will remember that on Tuesday last I placed on the Notice Paper the Question which I have repeated to-day. Although that Question had been on the Paper for several days, the noble Marquess to whom I addressed it declared himself utterly ignorant with regard to any answer he could give. I confess I was greatly astounded at receiving such a reply, and at the same time I said that I considered the reply extremely discourteous. On those grounds I have repeated the Question to-day. I do not think the noble Marquess can again repeat that he is ignorant of the answer, as he has had now, after the warning I gave him, plenty of time to make himself master of the details. If he again thinks it right to plead ignorance I am bound to say I shall consider the ignorance wilful and premeditated. The noble Marquess is a prominent member of His Majesty's Cabinet, and he told us the other day that he will be in charge of the Home Rule Bill when it reaches your Lordships' House. Consequently he must be in a position to have access to every Paper and to make himself master of every fact and detail in connection with that Bill. The Report to which I have alluded is a most important item in connection with that Bill, and I say deliberately that if the noble Marquess again pleads ignorance or does not give me a direct answer, we&#x2014;and there are many of us&#x2014;shall believe that this Report has been submitted to Nationalist Members, and that His Majesty's Government are ashamed and afraid to acknowledge or justify that action. I beg to put my Question.</p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01021"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: I scrupulously avoided that. I said I would not call it unfair, but I could not say that it was fair.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01022"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I am afraid that is somewhat faint praise of my attitude on that occasion, but I should be exceedingly sorry to treat any member of the Party opposite either with discourtesy or unfairness. If I desired to adopt that attitude, the last man that I should desire to subject to it would be the noble Marquess opposite. What I said on Tuesday was that in my view the question whether this confidential Paper had or had not been shown to any individual outside the Cabinet had no effect whatever in limiting the responsibility of His Majesty's Government in relation to the financial terms of the Home Rule Bill which will be introduced next month in another place; and in order to impress upon your Lordships that view I added that so strongly was this my conviction that I had not even taken the trouble as a member of the Government to inquire for my own information as to whether any individual had or had not seen the Paper. I was careful to add that, even if I had made the inquiry, its result could have had no effect upon the answer which I should give to the noble Marquess, because for the general reasons which I have given of the history of the affair, and of the private and confidential nature of the inquiry, that fact made it impossible to reply either "Yes" or "No" to the question. On that point I am afraid I can give the noble Marquess no further information. I explained that the inquiry was an informal one for the benefit of His Majesty's Government and to assist them in the preparation of the Bill. The existence of that inquiry was, as the noble Marquess himself pointed out, casually, and surely quite harmlessly, mentioned by my right hon. friend the Chief Secretary&#x2014;mentioned, it is reasonable to conclude, merely as a piece of evidence that His Majesty's Government were paying close attention to that side of the question. But the inquiry was, as I have said, an altogether informal and confidential one, and it would, I think, involve a complete departure from precedent to discuss whether a particular confidential Paper had been shown to any person outside the immediate circle for which it was prepared, and thereby to invite a discussion as to whether a
<col>482</col>
Paper, the contents of which, after all, are so far not known to the public, ought or ought not to have been seen by any eyes but those of His Majesty's Ministers. I fear, therefore, I have nothing in substance to add to the reply which I gave to the noble Marquess the day before yesterday.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01023"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Marquess has nothing to add, but I think he has forgotten his last answer. He stated distinctly on the last occasion that he did not know whether communication had been made of the Paper to any one outside the official list of the Government. That was the point to which I addressed myself when I spoke. Now the position is this. The Government do not recede from that statement. The noble Marquess does not say now whether lie knows or does not know. That is the difference between his answer now and the answer which he gave the other day. Does he know or does he not know now? He has not said that. This is a document obviously of importance. It must play some part, I would say a considerable part, in the statement of the ease by the Prime Minister elsewhere. It must be commented upon here by the noble Marquess who is going to be in charge of the Home Rule Bill. It is obvious that when the debate is opened any side of the House which is informed of the contents of that document will have a considerable advantage. They will know how to deal with it; they will know how to qualify it if it needs qualification; they will know how to rely upon parts that are in their view worthy of being examined from a critical point of view. It will be a distinct asset in the debate to have a knowledge of that document. The noble Marquess's position is this. He can make a solemn oath that would be accepted by everyone that the document was not communicated to any member of the Opposition, but when he is asked a question which covers Mr. Redmond and his Party the position of the noble Marquess is that "where ignorance is bliss 'tis folly to be wise."</membercontribution></p>

<title>IRISH JUSTICES OF THE PEACE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01026"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member> rose to call the attention of His Majesty's Government to the position of certain magistrates in Ireland, namely, Mr. J. K. O'Connor, of Castleisland, Co. Kerry; Mr. Eugene O'Sullivan, of Killarney; Mr. Patrick Scott, of Scribbagh Garrison, Co. Fermanagh; and Mr. John Sweeny, Burton Port, Co. Donegal&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>1. In relation to the conviction of these magistrates in a Court of Law.</li>
<li>2. Their still retaining the office of Justice of the Peace; and to move for Papers.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01027">The noble Earl said: My Lords, in calling the attention of His Majesty's Government to the position of certain magistrates in Ireland I do not intend to enlarge upon the evil of keeping on the Bench magistrates who have been convicted in a Court of Law of certain offences which I will mention. That, I should think, was palpably clear to everyone, and I hope it will be much clearer when I state the cases against these magistrates. The first case I will take is that of Mr. Eugene O'Sullivan. He was a candidate for the representation of East Kerry in the House of Commons and was elected, but there was an election petition in relation to that contest, and Mr. Justice Madden and Mr. Justice Kenny, who tried the petition, reported that corrupt practices were proved to have been committed with the knowledge and consent of the said Eugene O'Sullivan, and that the nature of such corrupt practices was "undue influence and intimidation exercised in order to induce voters to vote for the said Eugene O'Sullivan or to refrain from voting for the petitioner, John Murphy." The result of that petition was that the election was declared void, and the decision of the Judges was reported by Mr. Speaker to the House of Commons on July 11, 1910. But there was something further which was rather serious, and which Mr. Justice Kenny mentioned, with regard to Mr. O'Sullivan. Mr. Justice Kenny, in delivering judgment in the East Kerry election petition case, said&#x2014;
<quote>"The Firies district a quarter of a century ago was the scene of a terrible crime. It is hard to credit any decent law-abiding person identifying himself with that terrible outrage, yet we find the respondent (Eugene O'Sullivan) delivering a speech of a very shocking character in connection with moonlighting in the Firies district."</quote>
<col>484</col>
Mr. Justice Madden, too, said that of the speech of Mr. Eugene O'Sullivan and the sentiments that prompted it there could be only one opinion amongst those who had any respect for the law or any regard for the good fame of the county of Kerry. That is the record of Mr. Eugene O'Sullivan, and, as far as I know, after this occurred he was made a justice of the peace for the county, and for all I know remains on the Commission of the Peace. There I leave Mr. Eugene O'Sullivan.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01028">I now come to the case of Mr. J. K. O'Connor. Mr. O'Connor is a justice of the peace for the county of Kerry and stood as a candidate for the county council for the division of Castleisland. That election will long be remembered, because Castleisland swam in porter, and treating and drunkenness prevailed. So bad was it that the Roman Catholic Bishop of Kerry, in the Lentern Pastoral, referred to it. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"Another matter which a sense of duty compels me to mention is the manner in which some of our local elections are conducted. The language used, instead of being informing and elevating, is grossly personal, lowering, and demoralising."</quote>
And he concluded&#x2014;
<quote>"Worse still, some of these elections are conducted without even an appearance of public decency. They become the occasion of wholesale drunkenness, and sometimes even of violence."</quote>
Mr. O'Connor, at the Castleisland election, headed the poll. He is a most successful merchant in that town, and a wave of porter&#x2014;you can describe it as nothing else&#x2014;landed him safely on the county council beach. He headed the poll with a majority of thirty votes. But, alas&#x0021;there was an election petition. Mr. O'Connor appeared as respondent, and this was the result of the Commissioner's finding: He found that the respondent had been guilty of corruptly supplying drink to voters for the purpose of corruptly influencing such voters, and that the respondent was also guilty of corrupt practices, and he declared the election void. The Crown Solicitor of Kerry represented the Attorney-General for Ireland at the Commission. It is, I believe, laid down by Statute that the Attorney-General should report to the Lord Chancellor of Ireland any one guilty of corrupt practices at an election. That, however, was not done in this case. A long correspondence ensued between Mr. Peirce Gun Mahony (a Kerry gentleman) and the late Lord Chancellor, but nothing came of it
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0268"/>
<col>485</col>
whatever. Mr. Mahony also wrote to the Lord Lieutenant, and again nothing came of it. He also wrote to Mr. Redmond Barry, then the Attorney-General and now Lord Chancellor of Ireland, and received an answer that the matter had his attention. I would not have brought this before the House, but as far as I can gather the authorities have treated the whole matter with the utmost unconcern, and as far as I know this Mr. O'Connor is still a justice of the peace. But whether he is now or not, I am perfectly certain that he was for some time after this occurred in consequence of the authorities not acting at once as they should have done. That is the case against Mr. O'Connor.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01029">Now let me take the case of Mr. Patrick Scott, who is a justice of the peace for the County of Fermanagh. Mr. Patrick Scott has repeatedly been fined for drunkenness, especially in May, 1909, at Belleek. He became an <i>ex officio</i> magistrate for the County of Fermanagh in October, 1909, by virtue of his election to the office of chairman of the Ballyshannon (No. 2) Rural District Council. A year after, while still a justice of the peace&#x2014;namely, in November, 1910&#x2014;Mr. Scott was brought before a magistrate out of petty sessions at Enniskillen and fined 1<i>s</i>. on a charge of intoxication. That was, as I say, after he had been appointed a magistrate, and that has been admitted, in answer to a Question, by the Chief Secretary in the House of Commons. I am a magistrate for my county, and I am perfectly certain that if I was fined for drunkenness and then proceeded to sit on the Bench the first person who would ask a Question in the House of Commons about it would be the Nationalist Member for my county, and I should be removed&#x2014;and very properly so&#x2014;from the Commission of the Peace at once. But Mr. Scott goes on as chairman of the Ballyshannon Rural District Council and also as a justice of the peace administering justice, notwithstanding that after he was made a magistrate he has been fined for drunkenness.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01030">The last case I shall refer to&#x2014;and I am sure that your Lordships are tired of hearing of the ill-doings of these magistrates in Ireland&#x2014;is that of Mr. John Sweeny, who is a justice of the peace for the County of Donegal. Mr. Sweeny was, on February 14 last year, convicted of selling drink on premises not duly licensed, and was fined &#x00A3;50. Mr. Birrell, in answer to a Question in the House of Commons,
<col>486</col>
admitted that Mr. Sweeny had been convicted of the illegal sale of spirits and beer at his hotel in Burtonport, which is not licensed, and that he was fined nominally &#x00A3;50 in each case, but the fine was reduced by the magistrates to &#x00A3;12 10<i>s</i>. in each case with a recommendation by the Bench that the amount be further reduced to 10<i>s</i>. in each case.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01031">Those are the cases which I wish to bring before your Lordships. It is well that you should know the excessive supineness of the authorities in Ireland with regard to these cases. Surely the county Benches in Irelard ought to be kept as clear of these sort of men and their actions as possible. I am sure you will all admit that, and we ask that they should be. I do not care under what form of Government we are, nothing tends to the social welfare of a community more than that the magistrates who deal with small offences in a county should be above suspicion and should be men of integrity and high standing. That holds good in every country in the world and in no country does it hold so good as in England, where everyone is proud of the county magistrates. We ask that Ireland should be treated in the same way, and that there magistrates when they commit offences of this sort should be at once removed from the Bench. I have a sort of idea that perhaps some of these men are no longer justices, but I should like to ask His Majesty's Government how long after these offences were committed were they allowed to remain on the Commission of the Peace. That is the question I wish particularly to put. I beg to move for Papers if there are any available on the subject.</p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01033"><member>THE PAYMASTER-GENERAL (LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Motion of the noble Earl is another instance, of which we had au example yesterday, of the drastic o and disciplinary action which noble Lords opposite are always urging the Government of Ireland to adopt towards people who happen to be their political opponents. I do not know whether that is intentional or not, but the noble Earl will see that it must deprive his Motion of much
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0269"/>
<col>487</col>
of the moral force to which it would otherwise be entitled. Yesterday the attack took one shape against one individual, to-day it takes another against other individuals, but the objects and motives are always the same. I will say this, that if the suitability of every public officer in view of Ins speeches and actions is to be impartially considered, and if any departure from the best traditions of his office is to be visited with indiscriminate severity, there are other individuals occupying more important and more responsible positions whose actions would come under the consideration of the Irish Executive and whose dismissal from the offices which they occupy could, I think, be better defended in the public interest.<lb/>
Yesterday noble Lords opposite thought they had a good case, but they cannot expect to be always equally fortunate. I think the noble Earl who has moved this Motion had some misgivings in the matter, for he has no less than three times edited and revised the "black list" which he has submitted to your Lordships. But, even so, he has not succeeded in eliminating all the mare's nests which his original document contained, because the first gentleman to whom he called attention&#x2014;Mr. J. K. O'Connor&#x2014;is no longer, and has not been for a considerable time, on the Commission of the Peace. Now with regard to these cases, in the first place I must decline to discuss the cases which have been subsequently added to the list. I think the noble Earl himself will agree that when the subject involves the private character of certain individuals and the discretionary power of the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, it is only fair that longer notice should be given than that which he has been able to afford. One name was only put on the Paper to-day, and another name was only put down yesterday&#x2014;I refer to Mr. Eugene O'Sullivan and Mr. John Sweeny. Therefore I shall have to ask the noble Earl to be good enough, if he wishes to raise those two cases, to put them down for a future day. With regard to Mr. O'Connor, I have already stated that he is no longer on the Commission of the Peace. Mr. O'Connor, as the noble Earl has stated, was elected to the Kerry County Council in June, 1908, and was unseated on petition. For some reason or other, which is not very clear I admit, the fact was not brought to the notice of the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, and there was some doubt whether he could interfere
<col>488</col>
in the matter in view of the fact that he had no official information on the subject. But subsequently, in view of a decision given by Mr. Justice Kenny in another case to the effect that the office of a magistrate was <i>ipso facto</i> vacated from the date of the making of the report, the name of Mr. O'Connor was removed from the Commission. Therefore in that case the noble Earl's indictment is a little out of place.<lb/>
I come to the case of Mr. Patrick Scott, the only other case with which I shall deal to-day. It is true that Mr. Scott was on one occasion brought before a magistrate and convicted on a charge of intoxication and fined the sum of 1<i>s</i>. The matter was reported to the Irish Lord Chancellor, and he, having considered the circumstances of the case, did not consider it incumbent upon him to take action. The noble Earl also mentioned that this man had, previous to his appointment to the Bench, been convicted of a similar offence. With regard to that I should like, in the first place, to say that this gentleman was an <i>ex officio</i> magistrate. He owed his appointment to the Act of 1898 passed by the Party opposite, by which the chairmen of rural district councils and such like bodies become <i>ex officio</i> members of the magistracy. The Lord Chancellor of Ireland has always considered that, although he is, of course, responsible for these magistrates as he is responsible for all magistrates, his responsibility with regard to them is of a lesser character than if he had been responsible for their appointment, and he is always less inclined to intervene in those cases than if it was a case of an ordinary magistrate who owed his appointment to the Lord Chancellor's discretion and authority. I think the noble and learned Lord opposite will bear me out when I say that.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01041"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: This was rather a well-known Mr. Kelly. He was chairman of the Loughrea District Council, and this is what Mr. Walter Long said in answer to a Question in the House of Commons with regard to certain observations made by this gentleman&#x2014;
<quote>"I have referred this Question to the Lord Chancellor whose observations are as follows: Mr. Kelly became a magistrate under the provisions of the Local Government Act without the need of any previous sanction or approval from the Lord Chancellor, and he only thereon became amenable to the jurisdiction of the Lord Chancellor under the enactment which places him in the same position as other Irish magistrates with regard to conduct after he became a magistrate. But this power does not authorise the Lord Chancellor to inquire into speeches made several months before his election."</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01042"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: That is common sense.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01043"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: I agree, and that is the point I am trying to make. The noble Earl endeavoured to make a considerable point of the fact that this gentleman, who was in the same position as Mr. Kelly in that he was an <i>ex officio</i> magistrate, had been convicted of intoxication before he joined the magistracy. Then, of course, there was the subsequent charge after he had become a magistrate, and there, as I have said, the late Lord Chancellor, having the circumstances of the case before him, did not consider it sufficiently grave to justify him in removing this magistrate from the Commission. The fact that Mr. Patrick Scott was only fined 1<i>s</i>., which is a nominal fine, proves that it was not a serious offence. Anyhow, all I can say is that that is the position of affairs. With regard to the other two cases, I shall be glad to answer the noble Earl upon them on a subsequent occasion if he will put a further Notice on the Paper.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01045">[No answer was given.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01046"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DESART</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I had not when I came down to the Home by any means made up my mind to speak, though I had made myself acquainted with the facts of the cases cited, and after the explanation that has been given I think I ought to say one or two words. I heard with great regret the opening sentences of Lord Ashby St. Ledgers's speech in which he attributed to my noble friend political motives in bringing this matter before your Lordships' House. I hope that will not be assumed about all of us, because I certainly, speaking for myself, know nothing of the magistrates mentioned, and except from what I have read I know nothing of the incidents beyond those I ascertained when the matter was brought to my attention. I really must ask the noble Lord whether he does not think that it is a legitimate thing for noble Lords in this House to bring before the Government cases which affect the administration of justice.<lb/>
The pure administration of justice in the petty sessional Courts of the country is of the utmost importance to all classes of the community. I do not for a moment suggest that you can select magistrates from a particular class. I should be very sorry to say that. I believe that cases where objection is to be taken are not many in Ireland. I know that in my own county I am associated on the Bench with magistrates, some of whom are tenant farmers and, I believe, hold strong Nationalist principles, but who administer justice as well as any magistrates that I know of. I work with them on the pleasantest relations. So I start with no feeling whatever in the matter. But I do say you ought not to put aside an inquiry concerning a magistrate, who occupies a judicial position and exercises judicial functions, as a purely Party matter to be dealt with as such. My noble friend said very little of the case of Mr. O'Connor, and I will not deal with either of the cases with regard to which the noble Lord who spoke on behalf of His Majesty's Government said he had not had sufficient notice.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0271"/>
<col>491</col>
The case of Mr. O'Connor deserves a little more notice than has been given to it, because it has a very curious history. Mr. O'Connor was appointed a magistrate, as I understand, in 1907. I take no exception to his appointment, but whether or not he was appointed without sufficient inquiry&#x2014;and I do not attribute blame to the then Lord Chancellor for a moment&#x2014;he was unseated on petition, in the circumstances to which my noble friend has called attention, in 1908, and, that having happened. Mr. Mahony, the gentleman to whom my noble friend referred, being interested in the matter, communicated with the Lord Chancellor. I think his letter was written in August, 1910, and in April, 1911, he received a letter from the Lord Chancellor in which the case was dealt with as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"As to the case of Mr. J. K. O'Connor, of Castleisland, who is stated to have been reported by an Election Court for corrupt practices, neither the report of that Court nor the evidence on which it was based has been transmitted to the Lord Chancellor in accordance with the procedure prescribed by Statute. The Lord Chancellor does not, accordingly, consider that he is called upon to decide whether under the circumstances any action by him should or should not be taken or to express au opinion on the legal aspect of the ease."</quote>
You get in that way to a most extraordinary position.<lb/>
The Attorney-General, under a section of the Corrupt Practices Act, has a Ministerial duty thrown upon him to report every case in which a justice of the peace has been reported by an Election Court for corrupt practice. It was my duty for many years as Director of Public Prosecutions to perform that duty in this country, and it is not a matter in which any discretion is exercised. It is a mere Ministerial act, and, of course, it is possible that the Attorney-General's attention was not drawn to the omission of some one to write the letter for him to sign. Anyhow, you get to the position that it is not reported, and the Lord Chancellor stated that not having received the report there was nothing for him to do. It does seem that the result of that is entirely to neutralise the effect of the Act of Parliament, because it is a perfectly clear statutory duty. The report is to the Lord Chancellor, and the Lord Chancellor then exercises his discretion. That does not appear to have been done at this stage, and, as we were told by Lord Ashby St. Ledgers, it was
<col>492</col>
not until the case of another magistrate&#x2014;an <i>ex officio</i> magistrate&#x2014;was heard and the question was raised that the Lord Chancellor realised or thought that he ought to take action in the case of Mr. O'Connor&#x2014;in the year 1911 I think that was. That meant that Mr. O'Connor was exercising judicial functions from 1908 to 1911 without it having been considered at all whether he should or should not remain a member of the Bench.<lb/>
I am afraid it does not end quite there, because, as I read the Corrupt Practices Act, I am disposed to think that Mr. O'Connor was incapable of exercising his functions at all after the report of the Election Judges. The Statute seems to be clear, because what it says is this&#x2014;
<quote>"If a candidate is reported for treating or undue influence he is subject to the same incapacities as if at the date of the report he had been convicted on indictment of corrupt practice."</quote>
And another section runs&#x2014;
<quote>"A person convicted on indictment of corrupt practice shall for seven years not be capable of holding any public or judicial office, and if he holds any such office the office shall be vacated."</quote>
A judicial office is, in the interpretation clause, to include a justice of the peace. I should have hesitated to express that opinion if it had not been the exact point in the case before Mr. Justice Kenny when he quashed the conviction of a person convicted by a magistrate sitting under those circumstances. The result really is that Mr. O'Connor has exercised judicial functions for something like three years when he ought not to have sat at all. That was due, no doubt, to some official mistake at the beginning, because I have no doubt whatever&#x2014;and anybody who knew the late Sir Samuel Walker will agree&#x2014;that if he had realised the seriousness of the case some action would have been taken at the time.<lb/>
This has been altogether a most unfortunate state of things. I have no feeling whatever about Mr. O'Connor, and I can assure the noble Lord that I have no political feeling in this matter at all. But I think it is a most important thing that justice should be justly administered, and that people of all classes should believe that it is justly administered. If there once arises mistrust
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0272"/>
<col>493</col>
of the administration of justice communities begin to take the law into their own hands. The law is the protector of the weak and the guardian of everybody's rights, and its administration is of much more importance than whether it is a good law or a Lad law. I can only say that I am glad that at length the question of Mr. O'Connor has been settled.<lb/>
As regards Mr. Patrick Scott, I do not think there is much to be said. People may hold different opinions as to whether one conviction of drunkenness should involve removal from the Bench. I confess that if I had to give my own opinion I do not think leniency is much in place in dealing with magistrates so convicted. I am not, I hope, a hard man, but I think that to allow a person who has been convicted in the locality to sit on the Bench in judgment on other people charged with similar offences a very questionable thing. It is a case, perhaps, where severity against the individual may be necessary in the interests of the administration of justice.<lb/>
My working life has been passed in a responsible position connected with the administration of the criminal law. It is a matter which is near to my heart, and I do think that the case of Mr. O'Connor ought to have been a little more developed and explained. I desire to repeat that I make no attack on the distinguished Lord Chancellor of Ireland who has unfortunately passed from among us, or on the Attorney-General of the time. I am sure there was some mistake. I do not know whether this discussion will be of much use, but I am quite sure that the distinguished lawyers who now occupy the positions of Lord Chancellor and Attorney-General in Ireland will need no stimulus from this House to do their duty, and I recognise gladly that the particular wrong to which my noble friend referred has now been righted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01047"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords. I should not have intervened in this discussion had it not been for the rebuke, I think the wholly unjustifiable rebuke, which the Paymaster-General of His Majesty's Forces thought proper to address to my noble friend and those who have supported him on the present occasion. The noble Lord told us that we were not for the first time advocating drastic and
<col>494</col>
disciplinary action towards our political opponents. A more unwarrantable imputation of political bias was never, I think, made in this House. Does the noble Lord suppose that it is only those who hold our political opinions who are interested in the fair administration of justice by local Benches in Ireland? I say it is a matter which concerns all classes of the community, the humblest as well as those who are in a higher position. I believe it is notorious that many of these local Benches are at the present moment recruited in such a manner that nothing but a denial of justice can be expected from them in cases of a certain class. I have no doubt that if this attack had been anticipated we should have been able to bring forward examples in support of the view which I am endeavouring to express, but amongst the papers which I happen to have by me I have one or two to which I will venture to refer in order to convince the noble Lord that this is not, as he supposes, a mere Party move on the part of my noble friend and others.<lb/>
Here is the report of a case which was heard at Omagh before Judge Todd in the mouth of October last. His Honour said that the evidence was perfectly and absolutely clear and there was no contradiction, yet a number of magistrates expressed the opinion that the defendant should not be convicted. Judge Todd observed, upon that, that&#x2014;
<quote>"It made him ashamed that some gentlemen, after the evidence which had been sworn before them, should act contrary to it."</quote>
That was the opinion of a learned Judge.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01048"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: When was that?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01049"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: It happened in the month of October, 1911, at Omagh. Then in the case of Patrick Scott, referred to by my noble friend, I will read what the learned Judge&#x2014;Judge Craig&#x2014;had to say. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"He had often spoken about the class of persons appointed to the magistracy in both Counties Monaghan and Fermanagh. It was a disgrace to the administration of justice, and if the people who appointed such magistrates could only see them they would be ashamed of themselves."</quote>
I will give the noble Lord one more quotation. The Roman Catholic Lord Bishop
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0273"/>
<col>495</col>
of Elphin, in his address at Roscommon in June last, stated that&#x2014;
<quote>"Magistrates too often had no respect for their obligations to dispense the law justly and without favour. The Bench of Magistrates was sometimes so packed that culprits, although guilty, were certain to be acquitted."</quote>
With observations of that kind from a right rev. Prelate and from learned Judges, it is a little hard that we should be told when we draw attention to these matters that we are actuated only by political motives. I must say that all I have heard about the manner in which the Benches are recruited in Ireland leads me very strongly to the opinion that just as we had an inquiry into the appointments of justices of the peace in England, so it is high time that a similar inquiry should be instituted into the manner in which persons are appointed to the local Benches in Ireland, and the manner in which they are allowed to remain on those Benches after they have been guilty of conduct obviously and clearly rendering them unfit to perform judicial duties.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01050"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I merely rise with reference to the point raised by my noble and learned friend on the Cross Benches (Lord Desart) to express the satisfaction which I feel that in drawing the attention he did to the case of Mr. O'Connor he entirely exonerated the memory of my friend the late Lord Chancellor of Ireland from any imputation either of unfairness or of negligence. I am quite sure that all those who knew Sir Samuel Walker would know well that he was incapable of either. And in saying that I do not at all dissociate myself from the regret expressed by the noble and learned Earl on the Cross Benches that the oversight, or however it ought to be described, should have occurred by which the case of Mr. O'Connor, which seems to have been a simple one for action in the sense that his removal from the Bench was necessary by Statute after his adventures at the Castleisland election, was not dealt with.<lb/>
The noble Marquess opposite appeared to resent the observation which my noble friend behind me made at the beginning of his remarks. It is surely one of the unfortunate features of all discussions about Ireland that by common repute, when attention is drawn to a matter by one side or the other or when steps are taken by
<col>496</col>
one side or the other which may be described as being severe, motives are almost always imputed, and it is said that the action is due to some form of Party feeling. We all know and regret how high both Party and religious feeling run in Ireland, and if noble Lords opposite are on an occasion like this subjected to the possible imputation of motives by those outside&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01051"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: By those inside.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01052"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I am equally convinced that if it should fall to our lot at any time to be obliged to take action of a disciplinary character against those who are politically opposed to us, imputations of a similar character would be made, and supposing, for instance, at any time we found it necessary to deal with a prominent Orangeman in a disciplinary manner we should undoubtedly be told in the North of Ireland that we were simply actuated by Party feeling and opposition to Unionists. Nobody regrets more than I do that such a state of feeling should exist in Ireland as to make such imputations possible. It was certainly not the intention of my noble friend to accuse noble Lords opposite of being simply actuated by Party feeling, but he was within his rights, I think, in drawing attention to the fact that such imputations were not unlikely to be made.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01053"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Marquess, who was in some difficulty in making the somewhat laboured remarks which he has just made, must be conscious that the noble Lord who dealt with this question on behalf of His Majesty's Government made a grave mistake in commencing his remarks with the charge that this matter was brought forward for political motives. I ask any of your Lordships who listened to Lord Mayo whether the case could possibly have been presented in a more impersonal way. There was no suggestion that he knew anything of the politics or religion of any of the gentlemen mentioned. I myself do not know them. But the noble Lord who rose to speak in reply began by denouncing the whole matter as "a Party move." It is not a question of what would be said outside; it is a question of what has been said in your Lordships' House by the representative of the Government. I say the imputation was improper, it was unbecoming, it was uncalled for, and it should have been
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0274"/>
<col>497</col>
repudiated by the Leader of the House. The noble Marquess who leads this side rightly commenced his remarks by administering a dignified reproof of the language which had been used, and it would not have been unbecoming if the noble Marquess who leads the House had said some words to show that he concurred with what had fallen from the Leader of the Opposition.<lb/>
The noble Lord asked that two of the cases mentioned by my noble friend should stand over. Accordingly they will stand over until a future date. As to the case of Mr. O'Connor, the noble Lord informed the House that he is no longer a magistrate. That case occurred in the time of my lamented friend the late Lord Chancellor, for whom I had the most unqualified respect. He was a dear and valued friend of mine, and is no longer alive to give a statement of the grounds on which he dealt with the case, but I am sure he was animated by a high sense of duty. As to the other case in which he exercised a discretion, I have no doubt that when he did apply his mind to it he did so with an anxious desire to do what was right and what was required by the exigencies of the case. When attention is called at a subsequent date to the other cases mentioned I am sure they will be presented by my noble friend behind me with the same moderation that he has displayed to-day, and I trust that the matter will be dealt with on the next occasion by the Government without any suggestion of political motives.</membercontribution></p>

<title>BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01083"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to ask the noble Marquess who leads the House whether he is able to give us any information as to the course of business during the next few days.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01084"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (THE MARQUESS OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think it will be for the convenience of the House if I say a word, in response to the Question of the noble Marquess, on at any rate the possible course of business during the coming week. As the House is aware, the Prime Minister has to-day in another place introduced for First Reading a Bill in connection with coal mining. The introduction of that Bill
<col>502</col>
is brought about by the fact, which is familiar to all your Lordship, that after a series of negotiation conducted with great patience, in which His Majesty's Government have done their best to assist in bringing about an agreement, it has not been found possible to arrive at an agreement between the two parties except by some form of legislation, and it is hoped that when a measure has been passed through Parliament the passing of that measure will lead to immediate resumption of work in the coal mines. That being so, it is clearly important that the measure should be passed into law as soon as possible, because every, day's delay in the resumption of work brings about not merely a continued stoppage of the particular industry involved, but also the possibility of much distress to other industries not concerned in the particular dispute.<lb/>
The suggestion which the Prime Minister made yesterday in another place was that he should ask leave to-day for the introduction of the Bill, that the Second Reading should be taken to-morrow, and that the House of Commons should agree that the Bill should be passed through all its remaining stages on Thursday. That procedure, if taken, would enable the measure to he read a first time late on Thursday here, and we should then ask your Lordships to proceed with the Second Reading on Friday. But it was pointed out by members of the Opposition in another place that this procedure, particularly the absence of any delay between the First and Second Readings, would give the House of Commons but a short time to consider the features of the Bill, of which until to-day they are naturally ignorant; and it appeared to be suggested accordingly that, instead of taking the Second Reading to-morrow the Second Reading should be taken on Thursday, and that all the remaining stages of the measure should be passed in the House of Commons on Friday. That would prevent the Bill from reaching us here until Saturday; and in view of the urgency of the matter we should in that case I fear be compelled to ask the House to sit on Saturday for its consideration. I am quite certain that when important business is on foot your Lordships would not object to the unusual course of sitting on Saturday; but, on the other hand, you might reason-
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0277"/>
<col>503</col>
ably take exception to being asked to pass a Bill through all its stages on Saturday, in the course of a single day, and might complain that the time would be unduly short, and certainly I should not say that such a complaint was unreasonable. Neither should I say that in itself, in the abstract, the desire of the House of Commons to have a clear day between the First and Second Readings was an unreasonable one; but we might venture to point out that with only five days altogether available for the discussion of this measure it seems, on the face of it, a little hard that four of them should be allotted to another place and only one to us here.<lb/>
I say, my Lords, that the urgency of passing the Bill if possible this week is considerable, not merely on the general grounds that every day of delay which postpones the resumption of work in the mines is a misfortune in itself, but we are told that if the measure, assuming it to be approved by Parliament, does not become law this week, or at any rate does not pass through both Houses this week, leaving out the question for the moment of the Royal Assent, there is some risk that a whole week of delay in the resumption of work may thereby be caused. It may not seem altogether reasonable that it should be so, but we are given to understand that if the measure became law this week there would be a good prospect of resumption of work beginning on Monday, whereas if it was not passed until an early day next week the resumption of work might be postponed until the beginning of the week after, and that would be from every point of view, as I am sure the House will agree, a national misfortune. I have thought it well to explain to the House at some length what the precise position is, because in any case we have. I am well aware to call upon the House not merely for a sitting on an unaccustomed day but for a hurried procedure. It is, of course, quite clear that your Lordships cannot give any kind of promise or engagement to pass the measure until you know exactly what it contains, nor until you see it can you say in what form you will pass it; but I think it is important for the House to understand that the matter is one of great urgency and of the most serious moment. I am convinced, therefore, that
<col>504</col>
the House will be disposed to do all in their power to help His Majesty's Government, assuming that they approve of the measure, to make it into law as soon as possible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01085"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Marquess has explained with great clearness the position as it presents itself to His Majesty's Government, but I think those of us who have been listening to him must feel that so far as this House is concerned the position is a very unusual and a very trying one. I understand that the Bill will reach this House late on Friday night, and that it is suggested that we might pass it through the whole of its stages on Saturday. Now this I will take upon myself to say without hesitation, that no consideration of private convenience in a case of this kind would prevent us from doing anything that we legitimately could to meet a great public necessity. But, my Lords, it is a very grave proposal that this House should deal with a measure of such momentous importance in a single day and under circumstances which obviously render it quite impossible that we should even, except as a mere matter of form, suggest any amendment in the Bill.<lb/>
The noble Marquess has made it clear that he justifies his request because he and his colleagues have reason to believe that if the Bill becomes law this week there is at any rate a good prospect that work will be resumed on Monday next, while if the discussion of the Bill were to go over into next week in the view of the noble Marquess a whole week might be lost, and the resumption of work would take place, not on Monday, but probably a week later. That is, of course, a very material consideration. I should, however, be glad if the noble Marquess would tell us whether he is satisfied that both parties to this dispute&#x2014;the coal owners and the miners&#x2014;would be ready to facilitate such an immediate resumption as he hopes for in the event of the Bill becoming law. That is a question which he may be able to answer. Whether your Lordships will be prepared to meet the proposal of His Majesty's Government I cannot, of course, take upon myself to say until I have had an opportunity of conferring with those who usually act with us. The matter is a very serious
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0278"/>
<col>505</col>
one for this House and I am quite sure that the noble Marquess would not expect me on the spur of the moment to give him any expression, even of my own personal opinion, as to the possibility of adopting the unusual course which he has suggested.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01086"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: In reply to the noble Marquess I ought to explain that I did not altogether abandon the hope that the proceedings in another place in connection with the Bill might be concluded on Thursday night, in which case we should be able to take the Bill here on Friday, with the prospect, if it were desired, of continuing the discussion on Saturday. I may venture to remind the House that that was our original proposition, and the alternative proposition which would put it a day later here would only be entertained in deference to the strong views expressed in another place by the Leader of the Opposition there. Our original proposition would have got the Bill here on Friday.<lb/>
As regards the question of the resumption of work beginning next week, it is, of course, difficult, as I am sure the noble Marquess will appreciate, to speak of that in tones of any certainty. What I am prepared to say is that the hanging up of the Bill for another week would, in my opinion, endanger the resumption of work, because it would or might create the impression in the minds of the men, or of some of them, that there was an intention here to make some alterations in the terms or the scope of the Bill&#x2014;alterations which they would naturally assume would not be in favour of their point of view&#x2014;and a certain atmosphere of suspicion would thereby be created which we should all agree would be a misfortune. In any case, I am afraid we cannot regard it as a probability that all over England, Scotland and Wales men will return to work with a rush, either on Monday or on any other day. The resumption of work is bound to be a somewhat gradual process, varying, no doubt, with the exigencies and possibilities of different districts; but I am certainly prepared to say that in the view of His Majesty's Government the suspension of the Bill over Sunday would defer, and might endanger for some time, that resumption of work which we are all so anxious to see.</membercontribution></p>

<title>STAGE PLAYS (CENSORSHIP).</title>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01093"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD NEWTON</member> rose to call attention to the Report from the Joint Select Committee of the House of Lords and House of Commons on the Stage Plays (Censorship). The noble Lord said: My Lords, in drawing attention to this Report I should like to make it perfectly plain that I do so, not because I consider the Report of any particular importance, but because I think the time has arrived for the Censor&#x2014;in other words the noble Lord opposite, Lord Sandhurst&#x2014;to say something in his own defence. For some considerable time now his opponents have been allowed to go about representing him and his predecessor as a particularly stupid kind of despot, whose great object it has been to wreck and destroy the works of genius. And in giving my noble friend this opportunity of defending himself I
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0279"/>
<col>507</col>
should like to point out that I am exercising one of the few remaining privileges of this House&#x2014;it so happens that the noble Lord cannot be attacked in the House of Commons because his salary does not come upon the Votes&#x2014;and I have no doubt that we shall be deprived of even this meagre satisfaction before very long.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01094">Until about three years ago it is quite safe to assert that not one person in a thousand, or one in ten thousand, as far as that goes, knew that there was such an official as the Censor in existence, and there were still fewer who cared; and the ignorance upon that point is still so great that the public apparently believe that the person who exercises the functions of the Censorship is the Examiner of Plays, whereas, as a matter of fact, it is the noble Lord opposite, and I understand that he is quite ready to accept all responsibility on the point. About three years ago a number of persons banded themselves together and entered upon a campaign against the Censor. These persons consisted of dramatic authors, journalists and members of the House of Commons, and they carried on their agitation so successfully that the Government, which is always ready to make concessions to agitation against law and order, gave way and granted a Joint Committee of the two Houses, of which Committee I was myself a member. This Joint Committee sat for a considerable time and examined a large number of witnesses, who ranged over a large field. They ranged from a right rev. Prelate to the managers of minor music halls in the country quite a numerous class of persons were represented. There were managers, actors, solicitors, agents, critics and dramatic authors, and the members of the two latter classes enjoyed themselves enormously, as was not improbable in view of the fact that everything had been arranged for their especial benefit, and they came with books and bags crammed with jests and epigrams and impromptus and paradoxes, which no doubt to some extent bewildered the intellect of dull and conscientious persons like myself and other noble Lords who were there to adjudicate and report upon the question. But I was not altogether thrown off my intellectual balance, because at the end of the inquiry, in spite of these difficulties, I found myself in precisely the same position that I was in before it began, and having
<col>508</col>
refreshed my memory by going through the evidence, I remain emphatically of the same opinion&#x2014;namely, that the importance of the whole question is enormously exaggerated, and I was unable to see then, and I am unable to see now, that there is any cause which justifies a change in the present procedure.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01095">I am bound to say that that was not the opinion of the rest of the Committee. The Committee, with one solitary exception&#x2014;namely, myself&#x2014;decided that in future the office of Censor should be optional. I dissented from this recommendation because it seemed to me somewhat illogical. If you are going to make the Censor optional you may just as well do away with him altogether, and I do not see very much sense in having a Censor for people who want him and no Censor for people who do not want him. With reference to the numerous witnesses who appeared before this Committee, anybody who takes the trouble to read their evidence will realise that every one of them, no matter how anarchical might be his disposition, was in favour of control of some kind or other. He or she, as the case might be, had to admit that some form of control was absolutely necessary. The only question was whether that control should be before or after production, and it will be observed that opinion upon this particular question was very clearly divided. Managers, actors, agents, and all those persons who are interested in the commercial side of the drama, asked for a continuance of the present system, and the present system, to put it shortly, is this&#x2014;that every theatre and every play has to obtain a licence from the Lord Chamberlain. Although technically a licence of this character does not secure absolute immunity from prosecution, in practice it does secure that immunity, and it is rare that any attempt is ever made to interfere with a play that has once been licensed. As a matter of fact, the Lord Chamberlain's licence acts as a sort of passport which enables the play to travel throughout the country as a rule immune from interference. The contention of these people, to put it shortly, is that the present system affords certainty instead of a state of uncertainty, and that the value of it consists chiefly in the fact that when a theatrical company go upon tour they are protected from the arbitrary and capricious interference of local autho-
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0280"/>
<col>509</col>
rities. That is a thing which does not often take place in this country&#x2014;I believe it is more frequent in America&#x2014;but there have occasionally been instances in which Local authorities have interfered. I remember one being quoted by au important witness who appeared before us, and who said that when he went to perform in a certain town he found&#x2014;to use his own words&#x2014;two enormous policemen upon his stage, and when he asked them what they were doing there they replied, in the words and in the spirit of Mirabeau, "We are here by the will of the people to see that no improprieties are committed." As managers and all business people connected with the stage are satisfied with the present arrangement, it is not necessary to say much about them.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01096">And I do not think it is necessary to say much about another class&#x2014;namely, the critics&#x2014;because it is perfectly obvious that whether you have a Censor or no Censor, the critic will always have plenty of occupation, and even as it is he can spend almost as much of his time and ingenuity in criticising censored plays as in criticising plays which have successfully passed the test. The only class who really need be considered in connection with this matter ate the dramatic writers themselves. I gather from the evidence which came before the Committee that dramatists consist, roughly speaking, of two classes. There is the class which writes frankly to amuse and to make money, and there is a second class consisting of persons who honestly believe that they have a special mission to improve and to elevate the playgoer; and I do not think it is realised with what portentous solemnity these gentlemen occasionally take themselves. These authors take themselves much more seriously than a Governor, or a right rev. Prelate, or a Minister, and more seriously than any noble Lord upon either of the two Front Benches in this House. But as far as these persons are concerned I personally am quite impartial upon the subject. If it is, any satisfaction to the pioneer authors to know it, I am quite prepared to admit that if I have got to go to the theatre at all, I would sooner go and see one of their plays than I would go and see an adaptation of, say, a Palais Royal farce. The production of the pioneer author would exercise a less depressing effect upon me. But, as a matter of fact, my own opinion is not of any value at all.
<col>510</col>
I should, however, like to say this, that whilst I admire the talent of these gentlemen&#x2014;talent which is not always as much appreciated as they think ought to be the case&#x2014;I do not recognise that they have any special mission to improve or to elevate me or anybody else. I am not at all sure that they are capable of doing it, and I am not at all convinced in my own mind that they have anything to teach me. I am disposed to think that if T am really in want of moral elevation I should be more likely to obtain it if, instead of going to a pioneer play, I sat at the feet of one of the right rev. Prelates on the Episcopal Bench opposite.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01097">Now I come to the grievances of these authors. Their grievances are so numerous that it is impossible for me to enumerate them all, but a pamphlet which I received a day or two ago, and which I imagine has been circulated amongst the members of this House, states among other things that&#x2014;
<quote>"the continued subjection of authors to the indignity of censorship is not merely an injustice to the general community, hut a personal outrage."</quote>
They say, in so many words, "We are in what is little better than an absolute state of servitude&#x2014;a state of servitude at the hands of an arbitrary and soulless clod in the person of the Censor." Everybody else they exclaim is free. I cannot help being reminded, when I see these expressions, of the lamentations of Mr. Harold Skimpole, who, when he was about to be arrested for debt, exclaimed, " I only ask to be free; the butterflies are free; surely mankind will not deny to me what it concedes to butterflies. "The butterflies who are free, in the opinion of these authors, are the persons who represent music, painting, the Press, literature and public speakers. "All these, "they say," are free and untrammelled. They are not subjected to the indignity from which we suffer." I am not in the least prepared to admit that this is a correct statement. All a re subject to censorship of some kind.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01098">It is true that it would be difficult to say that music was subjected to a censorship, although I believe that in Ireland censorship is passed occasionally upon patriotic tunes. But painting can hardly be said to be altogether exempt from censorship. If a man paints a picture and wishes to send it to an exhibition,
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0281"/>
<col>511</col>
that picture has to run the gauntlet of a jury of some kind, and the indignity of having a picture rejected seems to me to be as great as the indignity of having a play refused. I do not think it is correct to say that the Press is absolutely free. The journalist, if I mistake not, has to submit his "copy" to an editor; he has no appeal from the editor, and it would not be the slightest use his making any protest at all. Literature, again, can hardly be said to be absolutely free from censorship. It so happens that I am engaged upon a modest literary work myself. Before that work is produced I believe I shall have to submit it to the censorship of the Foreign Office, but that does not weigh upon me like a sort of sword of Damocles. I do not feel any more mournful or depressed in consequence, though I might think that my opinion on the subject was quite as good as that of the Foreign Office censor. And you can hardly maintain that speech is absolutely free. In the House of Commons a Member cannot put a Question on the Paper without its being submitted to the censorship of the Speaker and the Clerks at the Table. The same thing applies here&#x2014;one of the last remaining homes of free speech&#x2014;and, as far as that goes, anybody making a speech here is liable to the censorship of the youngest and most inexperienced member of this House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01099">"But," say these people, "not only are we humiliated personally, but art is confined and hampered; the world is deprived of masterpieces because we are so sensitive that we refuse to submit them to the uncongenial personality of the Censor. "In other words, they maintain that there is a vast amount of original matter of the highest value which is never produced at all. I do not see that there is very much foundation for this particular complaint. It came out in the course of the Committee's proceedings that out of 7,000 plays during ten years only thirty had been rejected. Since the Committee reported I understand that something like 1,800 plays have been passed, 14 have been licensed subject to slight alteration, and 12 have been rejected altogether. "But," say these dissatisfied dramatists, "you must not look at it from the point of view of quantity at all. What you must consider is the quality of the work which has been lost to the public. Our work represents a kind of intellectual
<col>512</col>
radium; not the smallest atom of it should be lost, otherwise the whole universe will suffer&#x2014;"Then they say, "Think of the number of geniuses who have been dissuaded from writing by this particular fear." When pressed on the matter and asked to mention people who had been dissuaded from writing plays they, as a rule, are quite unable to mention anybody. In the course of our proceedings I can remember the name being given of only one eminent man who had been dissuaded for this reason from writing a play. Yet as a matter of fact a play by this gentleman is being acted at the present moment. On the whole, I do not think it is very uncharitable to conclude that people who do not write plays do not write them because they are unable to write them. That seems to me the most simple and obvious explanation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01100">I think it is only fair, in justice to the Censor, to point out that some of the most distinguished playwrights admitted that they had no grievance whatsoever, that they had never had any trouble with him at all. Mr. Barrie had to admit that he had never had any trouble with the Censor; Sir Arthur Pinero also admitted that he had never had any trouble with the Censor; the late Sir William Gilbert, whose works will, in all probability, live quite as long as any of the works of the pioneer author, said that he had only once had a difficulty with the Censor, and that was the occasion on which the Lord Chamberlain of the day was apparently of the opinion that the music of 'o The Mikado "and the Japanese National Anthem were one and the same thing. In the pamphlet to which I have alluded other grievances are pointed out. Why, it is asked, cannot the dramatist be treated in the same way as the novelist; and the writer of the pamphlet appears to consider it a crying injustice that whereas the novelist, in the story of " Robinson Crusoe," had been allowed to describe a naked savage, yet if that naked savage were introduced on the stage the man who was responsible for his introduction would be arrested by the police and severely punished. Personally, I do not see that he would have very much to complain of if such a thing did occur. But you do not want to be very clever, you do not want to have any knowledge of what I believe is called the psychology of crowds, to recognise the distinction between litera-
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0282"/>
<col>513</col>
ture and the drama. We all of us can read about very unpleasant incidents, very sordid details&#x2014;at all events I am sure that I can&#x2014;without suffering what Mr. Kruger would have called "moral and intellectual damage"; but if we were to see these kind of things represented on the stage, all right-feeling persons would be filled, not only with disgust, but with indignation. Another contention which was dwelt upon a good deal was that art should be dissociated from commercialism. To do pioneer authors justice, I must admit that none of them, so far as I can remember, complained of losing money. It appeared from the evidence&#x2014;it was a fact of which I was not aware myself&#x2014;that theatrical audiences consist mainly of intensely respectable people who appreciate virtue very much and flock in large numbers to theatres which deal in virtue; and, as a gentleman who appeared as an opponent of the Censor admitted, a theatre which deals in virtue takes more money in a week than a theatre which deals in curious subjects will take in a year. To put it quite shortly, there appears to be no money in pioneer plays.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01101">This by no means exhausts the list of complaints. One complaint which was very frequently uttered was that the Censor ought to be a man of the world, and not a retired bank manager, and it was also suggested that there ought to be sonic form of appeal. It was constantly pointed out that control should he subsequent to production, and not prior to production; that theatres should be placed upon the same footing as music-halls; and, finally, that the Censor himself acted in a capricious and inconsistent manner. As regards control after production and assimilating the practice to that which prevails in the case of music-halls, I will leave my noble friend opposite to deal with that particular point. But I think it must be fairly obvious to anybody that a prior censorship of music-hall performances would be practically an impossibility, because it would require the staff of a complete Government Department to undertake the work. As regards their last charge, that the Censor acts in a capricious and inconsistent manner, I must freely admit that this is the one complaint which appears to me to have some force in it. I am afraid that it must be admitted that, upon the face of it, the Censor is both capricious and inconsistent. I have seen

pieces comparatively recently which I have been somewhat surprised to find had evaded, so to speak, his net. But I do not think that my noble friend will have any trouble in showing that he has done his best to meet the complaints which were lodged against him.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01102">As regards the question of having a man of the world as Censor, I do not know whether my noble friend would be gratified by hearing himself described as a man of the world or not; but upon the whole I should say that a man who had been considered good enough to govern a good many millions of our fellow-subjects, and who had also been considered good enough to form part of a Liberal Ministry, was, upon the whole, good enough to decide whether a play was or was not fit for presentation; and as for his lieutenant, Sir Douglas Dawson, he appears to me to be about as suitable a person for the place as you could well find. Sir Douglas Dawson is not only an admirable linguist, but he has filled an important military post at two of the most fashionable cities in Europe, and upon the whole I am inclined to think he would be the precise type of person who would be selected on the stage to depict the absolutely perfect man of the world. So far from these two personages acting in a brutal and despotic manner towards dramatic authors, they always strike me as a pair of singularly meek official lambs, if I may say so without offence, who are perpetually shrinking from attacks on the part of wolves in the shape of authors.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01103">The process, as I understand it, by which a play is passed is that it is first of all read by one of two examiners. It then passes to Sir Douglas Dawson. Sir Douglas Dawson consults with the Censor&#x2014;in other words, with the Lord Chamberlain&#x2014;and if they think that there is anything which is objectionable or likely to be thought objectionable about the play, it is submitted to an Advisory Committee, which forms that appeal which the authors demand, and the constitution of this particular Committee is one which I should have thought would have satisfied most people. It includes two very distinguished lawyers, it includes one of the most distinguished literary men in the country, and it includes also, if I am not mistaken, two retired actors of considerable

<col>515</col>
eminence. If I might venture a suggestion to the noble Lord, if he desired to improve his Committee, in his place I should invite the Society of Authors to delegate somebody to sit upon it, and I should also invite a woman to form one of its members because I cannot help thinking that her presence might occasionally be found extremely useful. It scarcely ever happens that a play is refused outright. What does happen is that occasionally there are passages to which objection might be taken, and the author or his representative is sent for and asked in the friendliest possible way to make certain alterations. Probably the Censor says to him, "Here is a passage in your play which might offend Exeter Hall, or the Anti-Gambling League, or the President of the Chinese Republic. Don't you think that you might tone it down and make it a little less strong? "The reply of the author apparently is almost invariably, "What you are proposing to me is little short of an insult. You do not seem to recognise that my special quality is sensitiveness. I am full of sensitiveness as regards myself, but I have no sensitiveness whatever with regard to other people and to other people's feelings. I do not care the least what the feelings of the Anti-Gambling League or anybody else may be. What I do protest against is that you should call upon me to make any alteration in my masterpiece, however small it may be, and I will see you somewhere before I will do it. More than that, I will turn my trade union on to you. I will turn the Press on to you. I will get a Question asked about the matter in the House of Commons, and altogether I will end by making your life a burden to you. "In these circumstances, and if the author absolutely refuses to water down an adjective&#x2014;and sometimes it does not amount to more than that&#x2014;what is an official, however lamblike, to do? He is there for a particular purpose, and if the man will not advance a single inch to meet him he has no alternative but to say, "I regret it very much, but I am unable to license your play unless you will make the trivial alteration which I am asking you to make." That is the kind of thing which has frequently happened lately.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01104">I confess that it is an extraordinary thing to me that these very clever people, who, of course, are very much cleverer than I am or than is any noble Lord sitting
<col>516</col>
here to-day, do not recognise what an extraordinary benefit the Censor is to them. Sometimes I think that they really must realise the benefit although they deny it, and that nothing would distress them more than if the Censor were abolished, just as I believe nothing would distress certain people more than if Home Rule were to come into operation. Look at the advantages which they enjoy with the Censor there. Supposing their play passes, they are in precisely the same position as anybody else and enjoy equal advantages; but if he refuses to pass it, then at once they obtain notoriety. Their trade union takes up their case; eminent people write to <i>The Times</i> and say they have never known an instance of such stupid bureaucracy in the course of their existence; petitions are got up; publishers and booksellers sell an enormous number of copies of the censored play with the word "censored" printed in large letters at the particular points; and in many cases the play is performed. The censored author can get his play performed in Ireland whenever he likes. But the chances are that he gets his play produced in London by private enterprise, and, while it lasts, numbers of people crowd to see it. For instance, my noble friend Lord Ribblesdale, I observed, went the other day to see a censored play, and having seen it he wrote darkly warning us that terrible consequences might ensue if the present practice was allowed to continue. And, of course, he and other people also wrote and said that having seen the play, they could not see any harm in it. My experience of censored plays is small, but what I am given to understand is that in many cases they are so tedious, that even if there was anything objectionable in them it would be difficult for the person seeing them to keep his attention so concentrated on the piece as to notice where objectionable passages occur.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01105">But supposing these people are right from their point of view, their opinion would not weigh with me in the least. The people who go to these performances under the auspices of the authors' trade union would be the very first to admit, or rather to claim, that they are very superior people indeed. They are all very superior and very clever people, and they can attach meanings to things to which the ordinary person attaches a totally different meaning, and I am quite
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0284"/>
<col>517</col>
sure that if these people were to go and see a piece in which everybody appeared on the stage with no clothes at all, they are so clever and so ingenious that they would be able to prove that a spectacle of this kind was infinitely more stimulating and intellectual than if the actors appeared in the garb of ordinary life. As a matter of fact, these people are perfectly well able to protect themselves and do not require any Censor at all&#x2014;Lord Ribblesdale is, I am sure, quite independent of any assistance of the kind&#x2014;but they do not represent in the least the general public. There are, as a matter of fact, two publics&#x2014;one enlightened and interested in advanced ideas, represented, shall we say, by the noble Lord opposite, Lord Ribblesdale, and the other the general public. It is for the protection of the general public that the Censor exists, and although the Censor may be capricious and although he may make mistakes, not being infallible, yet upon the whole he affords a sort of rough protection; although he does not make you absolutely immune, yet he fulfils very much the same purpose as the certificate which you get from sonic sanitary authority as to the condition of a house before you take possession of it. He, in fact, is a sort of rough safeguard, which is in accordance with the wishes of the majority; and upon the whole it may be confidently asserted that it is better to have him than nothing at all, and that has been the opinion formed at all previous inquiries. There was an inquiry in 1853, another in 1866, and another in 1892, and in each case it was found that there was no justification whatever for interfering with this important official.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01106">The whole question is really whether there should be control before or after performance. If you are going to substitute control after performance for the present system, it means common informers, public prosecutors, attorney-generals, the interference of local authorities, disturbances in theatres, agitations in the Press, and discussions in Parliament. On the other hand, if you retain the present system, all that happens is that a certain number of persons are undoubtedly aggrieved. Well, I am sorry that this should be the case, but upon the whole this is most emphatically one of those cases in which, to use the words of Mr. Birrell, minorities must suffer; and
<col>518</col>
although I repeat that I am sorry that they or anybody else should suffer, it seems to me that as their sufferings are greatly exaggerated, and to an even greater extent self-inflicted, it is quite unnecessary to waste too much sympathy upon them, more especially if that sympathy should lead us to do away with a safeguard which, as far as we can tell, is in accordance with the wishes of the greater portion of the community.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01107"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD RIBBLESDALE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords. I think it was Charles II who was fond of coming down to the House of Lords for the reason that it amused him as much as going to a play. I feel certain that if Charles II had been here this evening he would have said that in spite of the vicissitudes which have attended this Assembly in the lapse of centuries, he had still every reason to be entertained if he heard such a speech as that to which we have just listened from the noble Lord opposite. Like Lord Newton, I had the honour, and indeed the intellectual pleasure, which he does not seem to have shared, of serving upon the Dramatic Censorship Committee. But, unlike Lord Newton, I did change my mind to sonic extent during the proceedings of that Committee and on the strength of the evidence I heard. I went into the Committee taking the view, which Lord Newton quoted just now as that of Mr. Skimpole, that everything should be free, and holding strongly from my own point of view that nothing in the form of censorship should interfere with the free play of ideas or even of opinions. I agree with the noble Lord that the whole question of the Censorship as presented to us in that Committee teemed with difficulties, and I came round to a rather different view and was willing to sign cheerfully the rather compromising Report which the Committee ultimately decided upon.<lb/>
The reasons I came rather round to this change of ideas proceeded on two main grounds. One is that you have this difference between London and Paris. In Paris you have a playgoing public perfectly well able to take care of itself, and in London you have a public which goes to the play, and you have that enormous suburban residential district all round London from which people bring up their sons and daughters at considerable expense to see the play; and I believe that that large playgoing public, however frail a
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0285"/>
<col>519</col>
fence the Censorship may be&#x2014;and it would be but frail if the Report of the Committee were adopted&#x2014;rather likes the idea of a fence of some kind. That was one reason. The other reason was that the advantage of the Censorship at present is that it makes a play a commercial commodity, and so I think to some extent it encourages managers and indirectly writers to produce good plays. I am afraid that if we had no Censorship we should have to prepare ourselves for an era of dull drama, for the actor-manager, who is the man who has to stand the shot of the money, would never dare to produce a play, because, as Lord Newton said, he would be afraid of local authorities, watch committees, and so on. I should be very sorry to see a dull period of drama which would prevent altogether our getting the good plays, many of which pass the Censor now, which I think Lord Newton called the plays of the advanced writers.<lb/>
I am not going back in any detail to the Report of the Committee or to its controversies. My apprehensive eyes are much more fixed upon what is to happen in the future. As Lord Newton told the House, I went the other night to see the play "The Secret Woman." I will not follow him into that. I do not think I said that I could not discover the passages which could possibly be objected to. What I. said was that if a play like that was censored under the new arrangement of this Advisory Committee which had been added to the Lord Chamberlain's staff, I felt a little nervous of what the future of the drama was going to be, and it is to that that I mean to direct the few observations which I shall make this evening. Your Lordships know that this Advisory Committee which has been appointed was not considered a very good thing by the Joint Committee. In our Report we say that although such a committee might perform some useful functions, it would be quite inadequate to the solution of the question. To lead your minds a little in the direction which I believe to be necessary and requisite to any fair consideration of the question of the Censorship with a power of veto before production, I will read two or three sentences from the Committee's Report. Lord Newton did rather scant justice to the able school of writers who devote themselves to the treatment of a particular kind of idea or
<col>520</col>
problem which he finds tedious, and of which, in short, he does not approve. That, of course, is a matter of opinion, and his opinion is as good as anybody else's, though I do not think that I am altogether prepared to congratulate him on that sort of stock-in-trade opinions. This is what the Committee say in their Report&#x2014;
<quote>"More and more the theatre is attracting writers of intellect who desire to present through its agency sincere and serious dramas, critical of existing conventions. It is this fact, rather than any greater stringency than hitherto on the part of the Censor, which is the cause of the complaints that have found powerful expression before us."</quote>
Then the Report goes on to say that practically very few plays had been censored. Lord Newton was quite right in saying that the number was about 30 out of some 7,000. Then we go on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"This is not the measure of the activities of the Censorship or of its effects. We were informed by the Examiner that almost every week plays are modified in greater or less degree to meet the objections of the Censorship; and we have been assured by playwrights that the fear of its intervention seriously hampers their work. To what extent these considerations operate is obviously incapable of measurement. A censorship of the Press might not touch one newspaper article in a thousand submitted to it, but its effect might be immense."</quote>
Then we go on to say that many people regard the drama as&#x2014;
<quote>"a most useful vehicle by which great ideas, of profound importance to human well-being, whether touching on the relationships between the sexes or on other problems of human society, may be communicated by the thinkers to the citizens at large. Into this controversy we need not enter. It is clearly not the duty of the State to enforce by law the opinions of those who hold the former view, even if it be correct, upon those who hold the latter."</quote>
That I conceive to be important if we are to form any real impression of the difficulties of the Censorship.<lb/>
What I am going to refer to particularly this evening is the Advisory Committee which has been added to the Lord Chamberlain's Department, and which I suppose is a powerful auxiliary of the Lord Chamberlain's. Lord Newton has told us who these gentlemen are, and I recognise at once that they are a panel of highly superior people in every way. You cannot have better men as representing law or as representing letters, or as representing the early Victorian notions of the drama in which I was myself nurtured. But by their fruits we must know them. We have
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0286"/>
<col>521</col>
not seen many yet; but the first thing they appear to have done was to censor the particular play which was referred to just now, and I admit that that makes me rather uncomfortable. In the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> of January 31 there was one of those inspired interviews which we occasionally read in the newspapers. A representative of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> went down to the Lord Chamberlain's Department, and I need hardly say he was received with great courtesy, which is duly dwelt upon in the article. In this interview which is of considerable length, these words occur&#x2014;
<quote>"Another subject touched upon was the work of the Advisory Board, the importance of which it was hinted had not, perhaps, been sufficiently appreciated in certain quarters."</quote>
I do not know what those quarters are, but I am inclined to think that the work of this Advisory Committee is likely to be very important, and it is on that point that I want to ask the noble Lord, Lord Sandhurst, three or four questions.<lb/>
Being a fair-minded man, I took the precaution of submitting to my noble friend in a pretty defined way all the questions I intended to ask. The first question I should like to ask is, How does this Advisory Committee exercise its functions? Let me first of all remind your Lordships of the names of the members of the Committee. They are Sir Edward Carson, Mr. Buck-master, Sir Walter Raleigh, Sir Squire Bancroft and Sir Douglas Dawson. The Controller, in describing it to the Joint Committee, told us that the opinion of the Advisory Committee, if it was constituted, would only be called for when negotiations between the Department and managers had come to a deadlock. I should like to ask my noble friend whether this is so. In practice I believe I am right in saying that the decision of the Advisory Committee on the question of "The Secret Woman" was taken by the Department upon the first application for a licence. Then I should like to ask whether the members of the Committee themselves read the plays on which their opinion is asked. No doubt it could be got over by a number of typewritten copies, but it is hardly conceivable that people who are so occupied as Sir Edward Carson, Mr. Buck-master and Sir Walter Raleigh, who I believe is a lecturer at Oxford and a very eminent man of letters, would have time to read all the plays submitted to the Lord Chamberlain's Department. If they do not read all the plays, how is it done? Are the
<col>522</col>
plays read to them? That is hardly conceivable. If the whole play is not read, I assume that isolated passages are read to them&#x2014;that is, the passages to which the Examiner of Plays has taken exception. Well, are these passages read by the person who has taken exception to them? Because it is perfectly clear that the man who has interpreted the point in some particular way is hardly the person to put that point to the body whose opinion lie is asking. Then I should like to ask whether a manager or a writer is able to appear in his own defence before the Advisory Committee, or whether, as it were, only the case for the prosecution is heard.<lb/>
The other two questions are, I think, very minor ones. I should like to know how many members of the Advisory Committee form a quorum, and whether on the minutes or in any other way a record is kept of the opinions of the various members of the Advisory Committee. The Lord Chamberlain knows, and we all know, that one of the reasons for the great exception taken by those who do not agree with the Censorship is the secrecy of the Censorship proceedings. If under existing circumstances records are kept of the views taken by the Advisory Committee it might be a very good thing, and it would possibly remove that notion of secrecy and covering up if some sort of idea was given to the writers of the view taken by the members of the Advisory Committee. I have nothing more to say. Speaking for myself, I very much prefer the old Censorship, the whole responsibility resting on the Lord Chamberlain, to the new arrangement by which this Advisory Committee has been created. On the other hand, the noble Lord below me (Lord Sandhurst) may be able to give me satisfactory answers to the four or five questions I have put to him, and, if that is so, my apprehensions as to the future will be to some extent removed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01108"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF PLYMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I add one question to those which have been put to the Lord Chamberlain. I was one of those who signed the Report of the Joint Committee, and the question that I should like to put is whether the noble Lord can inform me what the views of His Majesty's Government are with regard to this Report, and whether there is any prospect of their acting upon it. That was not at all, I know, the intention of my noble friend behind me, Lord Newton. I do not think he desires that His Majesty's Government should act upon the Committee's
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0287"/>
<col>523</col>
Report. The noble Lord, I venture to think, made rather light of the authors in this matter. It came really to this, that the main difference of opinion was between the authors and the managers of theatres, and it was the hope and intention of the Joint Committee that they had arrived at some solution which, I do not say would satisfy either of these two parties, but which would not be unsatisfactory&#x2014;that is, by giving certain relief to the authors and at the same time giving that security to the managers to which they thought they were entitled; and so this solution was arrived at of retaining the Censorship, but of allowing authors, if they could Lind managers to act with them, to produce plays if they pleased which had not been brought before the Censor. I do not desire now to go any further into the details of the Committee's Report, but I would like to ask whether there is any prospect of His Majesty's Government taking any action upon that Report.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01109"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF LYTTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this debate was introduced by my noble friend Lord Newton in a speech full of his characteristic humour and spirit of chaff, but I am afraid I cannot share my noble friend's opinion that the whole question is a matter of no importance and of very little interest to other than a limited number of persons. I am not a dramatic author, but I am afraid I must plead guilty to regarding this question with that "portentous seriousness" of which my noble friend complains. Lord Newton said that until three years ago nobody, or rather I think he said only one person in a thousand, had ever heard that there was a Censor or knew what the operation of the Dramatic Censorship was. I think it right, therefore, to remind my noble friend that the history of the opposition to the Censorship is a little older than that. In fact I have myself, if I may say so, an hereditary interest in the question, because it is now just eighty years ago that the question was raised in Parliament by my grandfather, who emphatically condemned the operation of the Censorship, and urged that&#x2014;
<quote>"the public taste, backed by the vigilant admonition of the public Press, may be more safely trusted for the preservation of theatrical decorum than any ignorant and bungling Censor, who (however well the office may be now fulfilled) might be appointed hereafter, who, while lie might strain at gnats and cavil at straws, would be without any other real power than that of preventing men of genius from submitting to the caprice of his opinions."</quote>
<col>524</col>
I have been interested in reading the debates of that time and in noticing some of the arguments by which the Censorship was then supported.<lb/>
One of the strongest opponents of my grandfather's Motion, one of the strongest supporters of the Dramatic Censorship in those clays, said that it would be impossible to mention a single case in which the Lord Chamberlain had refused to license a drama which could with any propriety have been played. I think even my noble friend Lord Newton would not be bold enough to make any such challenge to-day. He has himself reminded us that plays which had at one time been censored have afterwards been produced with the Lord Chamberlain's licence, and that many others that have failed to pass the Censor have been privately acted. Both he and Lord Ribblesdale referred to a play recently censored by the Lord Chamberlain which was privately produced within the last few weeks. Possibly some of your Lordships may have seen that play. If so, I do not think that any one of you would be prepared to say that it was unfit for production on the public stage. I am one of those who oppose very strongly the institution of the Dramatic Censor, but I hope that in anything I say on the subject it will be understood that I am not making anything in the nature of a personal attack upon the present holder of the office. It is the institution, and not the Lord Chamberlain, to which I object, and I hold that the operation of the Censor would be equally obnoxious, no matter in whose hands it was placed.<lb/>
The Notice which my noble friend Lord Newton placed upon the Paper was to call attention to the Report from the Joint Select Committee of the House of Lords and House of Commons on the Stage Plays (Censorship), but I noticed that in his speech he was careful to refrain from calling attention at all to that Report. So far as I am aware, he never mentioned it beyond saying that he was in total disagreement with the recommendations to which his name was attached. I must therefore ask your Lordships to consider for a moment this Report, which is really the subject of our debate this evening. It is, to my mind, remarkable for two things. First of all, for the full admission which it makes of the justice of the case brought
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0288"/>
<col>525</col>
by the dramatic authors against the Censorship and of the theatrical managers in support of it. Secondly, it seems to me remarkable for the childlike simplicity with which the members of the Committee propose to take away the censorship from dramatic authors who object to it and to give it back, on the other hand, to managers who are in favour of it.<lb/>
What was the case laid before the Committee? It was two-fold. First of all, there was the case of dramatic authors, who were quite unanimous in saying that the Censorship was a great hindrance to the development of serious drama. Now this contention was fully admitted by the members of the Joint Committee. They say on Pages VIII and IX of their Report&#x2014;
<quote>"A Censorship with a power of veto before production is open to grave objection. Secret in its operation, subject to no effective control by public opinion, its effect can hardly fail to be to coerce into conformity with the conventional standards of the day dramatists who may he sucking to amend them. Those standards are not absolute. It is an axiom underlying all our legislation that only through the toleration of that which one age thinks to be error can the next ago progress further in the pursuit of truth."</quote>
And they sum up their opinion on this subject by saying&#x2014;
<quote>"In view of the danger that official control over plays before their production may hinder the growth of a great and serious national drama, and of the grave injury that such hindrance would do to the development of thought and of art, we conclude that the licensing authority, which we desire to see maintained, should not have power to impose a veto on the production of plays."</quote>
The second case which was laid before the Committee was that of the theatrical managers, who with almost equal unanimity claimed that the licensing of a play before production was essential as affording them some security for the conduct of their business; and the Committee just as fully admit the justice of their contention, and just as emphatically recommend that the producers of plays should have access prior to their production to a public authority, which should have power to license the play as suitable for performance. If I may mention another instance of the contradictory nature of this Report, I would refer to what the Committee say on Page XIII, where they recommend the creation of an Advisory Committee, having already heard in evidence that this course was in contemplation by the Lord Chamberlain. They say that he would be well advised
<col>526</col>
to pursue his intention of appointing his Committee; but at the same time, recollecting, perhaps, some of the criticisms made by other witnesses against such a Committee, they add that they do not regard its formation as at all adequate for the solution of the question, and they point out that in course of years precisely the same objections would attach to an Advisory Committee as already attach to an individual Censor. In effect, therefore, it comes to this, that in the opinion of the Joint Committee of the two Houses of Parliament who inquired into this matter, the Censorship of the Lord Chamberlain is in many respects admirable and ought to be continued, but in future nobody should be required to pay any attention to it. Secondly, that the obligatory licensing of a play is for many other reasons highly objectionable, and therefore ought to be abolished, but at the same time the owners of theatres may refuse to allow other than licensed plays to be produced at the theatres belonging to them, thereby making once more the Lord Chamberlain's licence obligatory for every play.<lb/>
Then, again, the secret and irresponsible character of the Lord Chamberlain's veto is, in the opinion of these gentlemen, a hindrance to the production of serious drama, to protect which they suggest that a Committee of the Privy Council, equally secret in its proceedings and equally irresponsible is to be given powers even more sweeping than those of the Lord Chamberlain; and lastly, they recommend an Advisory Committee to assist the Lord Chamberlain, although they admit that that body will possess all the disadvantages which attach to the Lord Chamberlain's Office itself. The fact is, that a most heroic attempt has been made by these gentlemen to please everybody, and the result is they have met the fate common to such ambitious persons&#x2014;they have pleased no one, not even themselves. My noble friend Lord Newton repudiated the whole Report; Lord Gorell has pointed out the strong legal objections to setting up a law which is no law, a Censorship which is no Censorship; Lord Ribblesdale told us that, having seen in the last few days a play which had received the censorship of the Lord Chamberlain, he was now inclined to consider the question of abolishing the Censorship. The authors are not satisfied; they realise that the concessions made to them by the Committee
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0289"/>
<col>527</col>
were entirely illusory. Lastly, I feel quite sure that the Lord Chamberlain himself is well aware of the impossible position in which be would be placed under the recommendations of the Committee, and therefore he ignores their recommendations, and up to the present nothing whatever has been done. Of course, when I say that he ignores their recommendations and that nothing has been clone, I do not forget the one exception of the Advisory Committee. And, my Lords, I am not at all surprised that that should have been the one recommendation of the Committee which he has adopted. In the first place, it was his own suggestion, made without consulting the Committee at all; and, secondly, it seems to me to be a practice of our modern life which is rapidly becoming almost universal, that wherever the smallest relic of individual responsibility can be detected&#x2014;and evidence of real responsibility is becoming as rare as a white blackbird&#x2014;you should immediately smother it up by appointing some sort of Committee. Already the responsibility of the Lord Chamberlain is diluted and shared with two Examiners of Plays and their staff, but still the act of censorship exercised by the Lord Chamberlain is one of the few remaining acts of government the responsibility for which can more or less be traced to a single individual. I am not surprised, therefore, that the Lord Chamberlain, who happens to be the responsible person in this case, should have hastened to screen himself behind the inevitable Committee.<lb/>
Now, if the recommendations of the Joint Committee are so contradictory and unsatisfactory in their nature, it is only fair to ask, What then is the remedy for dealing with the question of the production of plays? I have no hesitation in saying that the only remedy to my mind is the frank abolition of the power to censor a play in manuscript previous to its production&#x2014;a power which is simply an obsolete survival of a bygone age, which is hopelessly out of date at the present time and entirely mischievous in its operation. Other speakers have referred to the fact that most of the witnesses before the Joint Committee dwelt upon the necessity of exercising some sort of control of dramatic performances. I quite admit that, but control of performances is a very different thing from censorship of manuscripts. If after production it
<col>528</col>
can be proved that the performance of any play is attended with consequences seriously detrimental to the public interest, then let it be dealt with by the machinery of the ordinary law. But the law which gives protection to the public in these matters must also give protection to those who are concerned in the production of plays. To place the producers of a play, the authors and the managers, at the mercy of any chance individual, would simply be to set up a censorship much more rigorous and much more arbitrary than that of which we complain to-day. At the present moment the manager of a theatre, on the payment of two guineas, can secure a licence for a play from the Lord Chamberlain which practically gives him indemnity against any objection which may subsequently be raised to the production of that play. I object to this patronage of the Lord Chamberlain just as strongly as I object to his veto, and I hold that it is only right that those who make a profit out of producing plays should bear the responsibility for any consequences which may result therefrom. It is, therefore, in my opinion the theatre which ought to be licensed and not the play, and just as in the case of the licence of a public house, the licence of a theatre ought not to be forfeitable for anything except a judicial reason. I hold that there is nothing to justify in the case of dramatic performances any exceptional machinery in the shape of individuals, or committees, sitting <i>in camera</i>. If there is to be any control, make your law as definite and adequate as you please, but let it be law and not private opinion which shall determine these matters.<lb/>
There are some people who claim that a play differs so markedly and entirely from any other method of expressing or influencing opinion that it must receive exceptional treatment. I want to examine this contention for a moment. What is the justification for imposing upon plays a censorship which would never be tolerated for a moment in any other department of intellectual thought? My noble friend Lord Newton says that we have in fact a censorship to-day of books and newspapers and pictures and even of public speeches, but when he endeavoured to explain to your Lordships what that censorship was it simply amounted to this, that the censorship of a book was that of a publisher in the first instance and
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0290"/>
<col>529</col>
afterwards of the public; that the censorship of a picture was that of the Gallery to which the artist sent it; and that the censorship of a public speech was that of the audience to whom the speech was addressed. Quite apart from the Lord Chamberlain, such censorship does and always will exist in the case of a play. The theatrical manager corresponds to the publisher or the editor or the hanging committee of an Art Gallery, and the censorship of the public is the same in all cases. No one objects to these things or wants to get rid of them. My only contention is that the opinion of the Lord Chamberlain is no more required before the production of a play than before that of a book, a picture, a newspaper, or a speech. Freedom of expression, whether in writing or in speech&#x2014;although I am afraid my noble friend will call this "portentous seriousness"&#x2014;is one of the first indispensable liberties of a free people. We believe that we have that liberty in this country. Lord Newton very much doubts it, but we believe that we possess that liberty, and we are just as proud of it as we are of our Constitution&#x2014;if we are still proud of that&#x2014;of our Fleet, of our Courts of Law, of our roast beef, or of any of the other institutions which we regard as especially English, and, unless we are wholly hypocritical and insincere in the eulogies we shower on this precious liberty and the condemnation which we pass upon every infringement of it in other countries, the censorship of plays ought to be just as objectionable and odious as any other kind of censorship, and, if it is tolerable at all, only tolerable because of some special justification which distinguishes a play from any other form of expressed opinion.<lb/>
The only justification that I have ever heard, and the only justification which my noble friend Lord Newton gave to the House to-day is that a play differs from a book in this one respect&#x2014;that the words of a play are accompanied by action, and that they are not read in silence by scattered individuals, but spoken by an interpreter to a collection of human beings. Of course, all that is perfectly obvious; no one disputes it for a moment; and to a certain extent it is an argument, not in favour, but against the censorship of the manuscript of a play before its production; because if there is anything in the argument at all it comes to this, that it is the spoken
<col>530</col>
and acted word, and not the written word of the author, which ought to be submitted for judgment. I quite agree that that difference between a play and a book or a speech is a sufficient ground for imposing certain legal restrictions upon the places where plays are performed. But, my Lords, it is no sort of justification at all for superseding in the case of a play the ordinary law, and setting up one man or a committee of individuals to be arbiters over other men's opinions. The drink shop differs in precisely the same way from a book shop. There are ninny people who think that the evils of selling drink are so great that drink shops, ought to be put down altogether. Many people deplore the effects of the sale of liquor, but no one would suggest that the Master of the King's Household, and he alone, should determine what liquor should be sold in every public house in the country. Whatever may be the difference between the influence exercised by a play and by a book or a speech or any other method of expressing opinion, the arguments put forward by way of justification for requiring the author to submit his writings to a Court official before they are reproduced on the stage are precisely the same. They do not differ in the least from, or are not at all more convincing than, the arguments which could be used in favour of establishing a censorship of newspapers or books or speeches.<lb/>
But I may be told that if we establish complete freedom of the stage it may be abused; that it may lead to the presentation of sentiments or opinions and scenes which would shock the susceptibility of certain individuals. Of course it will be abused, just as absolute freedom in newspapers or in books or in speeches or any other matters is abused. I have no doubt my noble friend Lord Newton feels that if no opinions other than those licensed by himself, or the Lord Chamberlain, or by some other "man of the world," were to be uttered in a book or a speech, the influence of our literature, of the Press, and of our public platforms in this country would be very much more wholesome and beneficial than is the case to-day. All that may be very true. But let my noble friend introduce a Bill in which he attempts to enforce a censorship of that kind, and I am sure it would not be long before he found out the reception it would receive
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0291"/>
<col>531</col>
even in this House. But, my Lords, I do not want to argue this question simply and solely on the grounds of abstract theory. I am just as much concerned in protecting the interests of the drama as I am in defending popular liberties. The fact is that the Royal licence obtained for a play at the present day is already just as much abused as the fullest possible measure of liberty could be. The Lord Chamberlain's licence does not ensure a high moral standard of dramatic art. Its only effect is to protect the particular moral conventions of the day. Problems of sex, marriage, politics and religion are all discussed, on the stage, and so long as they are treated in a light-hearted manner&#x2014;like my noble friend Lord Newton's speeches&#x2014;so long as there is plenty of make-believe in them, and so long as they are put forth in a conventional setting, they are stamped with the approval of the Crown and receive Royal licence and patronage.<lb/>
But it is precisely the conventional standards of their day that the protestants of every age&#x2014;"the pioneer authors," as Lord Newton calls them&#x2014;are concerned to challenge. When they believe that conventional standards are misleading, it is only by a direct assault on those standards that they can hope to arrest the attention of the people whom they are trying to influence. Therefore the very first object of these men is to shock people out of their complacency. Their purpose is to shock. That is their object&#x2014;to make people thoroughly uncomfortable, by forcing them to look unpalateable truths in the face. It is precisely against these people that any kind of censorship, no matter by whom exercised&#x2014;whether by the Lord Chamberlain or by an Advisory Committee&#x2014;must inevitably erect an insuperable barrier. It is just that which is the business of a Censor. It is his business to prevent people from being shocked. They may be amused by witty representations of profligacy; they may lie harrowed by realistic representations of crime, or bored by moral lessons which deal with only obvious matters; they may even be corrupted by a subtle process which familiarises them with, and leads them to be entirely indifferent to, the social evils by which they are surrounded. All that may pass any Censor; but people must never be offended by any representation of the ugly realities of human conduct and
<col>532</col>
human motive. That is why a number of writers, who as my noble friend thinks have such an exaggerated idea of their own importance, those who are protestants against what they consider to be false and misleading conventional standards, feel that they are debarred from writing for the stage, and that is why the drama has failed to fulfil its proper share in contributing to the progress and enlightenment of human thought. [LORD NEWTON: How many?] My noble friend asks how many dramatic authors are debarred from writing for the stage. How can I tell him how many? A child once said that a pin had saved a multitude of lives by people not swallowing it. I cannot say how many lives a pin has saved, nor how many dramatists the Lord Chamberlain has discouraged. But if my noble friend will study the evidence brought before his own Committee he will see that one witness read letters from many of the best known authors of the present day in which they declared that among the reasons which had deterred them from writing for the stage was the feeling that they could not express themselves with freedom because of the operation of the' Censorship. Supporters of the Censorship draw a terrible picture of the evils which would result from establishing complete dramatic freedom. I am left entirely unmoved by these suggestions that if you were to do away with the censorship of the Lord Chamberlain disastrous consequences would overtake the country. I reply to these prophets of evil that we have already examples in America, in our Colonies, in Ireland, and even in the music-halls of this country. In all those places there is no Censorship to-day, and yet the disastrous consequence, the reign of profligacy and debauchery with which we are menaced without Censorship, is not to be found there. If it is true that an unfettered stage is capable of a considerable amount of harm, it is also true that it is capable of a considerable amount of good, and I am quite prepared to see the dramatic authors of this country fight out this battle of good and evil among themselves before the play-going public. I am quite confident that without the assistance of the Lord Chamberlain at all in any age and in any country serious writers, co-operating with serious actors and actresses, can be relied upon to ensure that the influence of the drama shall be a wholesome one in our national life.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0292"/>
<col>533</col>
I feel sure that it is quite unnecessary for me to disclaim any desire to provide immunity for those persons, if there be any, who want to make the influence of the stage more licentious or the drama a vehicle for obscene or scurrilous or seditious ideas. I feel sure that no one would accuse me of such a motive. Among all those persons&#x2014;and they are more numerous than my noble friend thinks&#x2014;who are opposed to the censorship of the Lord Chamberlain there is not one who does not oppose that institution from the highest possible motives and in the best interests of the drama itself. We who oppose the Censorship do so because we believe that the arbitrary interference of a State official with the work of dramatic authors is hostile to the best interests of the drama by discouraging able writers from devoting their efforts to that particular sphere of literature, by placing the seal of official approval upon many plays which are entirely frivolous and some which are even pernicious, while at the same time prohibiting others which have a high moral purpose; and we believe that if the stage is left free from all restrictions except those which are imposed by the ordinary law of the land, its influence will be better and not worse as the result.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01110"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SANDHURST</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the occasions on which the Lord Chamberlain addresses your Lordships are so infrequent that during the long time I have been a member of your Lordships' House I do not think I have ever heard a Lord Chamberlain called upon to say anything on behalf of his Department. That being so, I feel inclined to begin the few remarks I want to make with a sentence which. I tremblingly uttered in this House over thirty years ago, in which I asked for your patience and indulgence on account of my then youth and inexperience. I am quite certain that I need all your Lordships' indulgence to-day, though I cannot claim it on the former grounds.<lb/>
My Lords, I am not sorry that this debate has taken place. I will even say that I am obliged to my noble friend Lord Newton for having brought it forward, because for some time&#x2014;long before I had the honour of becoming Lord Chamberlain&#x2014;there has been a certain amount of indiscriminate criticism as regards the Office of what is called the Censor of Plays, and I think it is an advantage that I should
<col>534</col>
put clearly before your Lordships where the actual and practical responsibility does rest, and also the procedure by which these matters are conducted. Lord Newton was very complimentary to the Advisory Committee. I think he called me and the Controller of my Department a couple of innocent lambs. I sincerely trust that we shall not be offered up for immediate slaughter. I also Lope that your Lordships will find that I shall not shrink from the responsibility which is undoubtedly my own. Lord Plymouth asked whether there was any intention of the Government acting on the Report of the Joint Committee. In reply to that question I have to say that the Report has not yet been considered by the Government with a view to legislation.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Ribblesdale asked me five very clear questions to which I think I shall be able to give him an answer which he will think equally clear; hut if he will allow me, I will do it when I come to the portion of my remarks under procedure, and if by any mistake my answer is not categorical enough I shill be very glad, with the leave of the House, to make the matter clearer. In the interesting speech to which we listened just now from the noble Earl Lord Lytton, he very truly said that he had a hereditary interest in this question, for Lord Lytton represents the third generation of a family whose distinction in art and literature has been recognised for a very long period of years. But if we did anything of the description that my noble friend wishes, I think it could only be done under legislation specifically brought in for that purpose.<lb/>
Two noble Lords have quoted extracts from the Report, and perhaps your Lordships will allow me to sketch very briefly the process or the processes in regard to the Office of the Lord Chamberlain. I do not know whether your Lordships have studied the Report on these matters or not, but it states that the theatres were connected with the Court at any rate since the time of Henry and were under a Master of the Revels. In 1628, according to the records in the Lord Chamberlain's Office, the Lord Chamberlain personally, or through the Master of the Revels, licensed theatres or closed them and had a general control over the work of dramatists. In 1737 was passed Walpole's Act, which made the functions of the Lord Chamberlain statutory. I think it was then that the office of Examiner of
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0293"/>
<col>535</col>
Plays was created, and it has existed from that day to this. The first Parliamentary Committee dealing with the matter was held under the presidency of the grandfather of the noble Earl opposite in 1832. That Committee reported in favour of some changes as to the licensing authorities, but the Report says that the Lord Chamberlain should have control. In 1843 was passed the Act which replaced Walpole's Act of 1737, and which is now the statutory authority under which the Lord Chamberlain acts. In 1853 a House of Commons Committee reported that the Censorship had worked well and should be maintained. In 1866 another Committee, having heard much evidence from people who were opposed to the Censorship, reported that the censorship of plays had worked satisfactorily, and that it was not, desirable that it should be discontinued. In 1892 there was a fourth Committee, which endorsed the judgments of its predecessors; and in 1909 the Report which we are discussing this evening recommended that the licensing of plays should remain under the control of the Lord Chamberlain and that the office of Examiner of Plays should be continued.<lb/>
Then in regard to the Advisory Committee, it has been said that the statement in the Report is half-hearted, but still this phrase does occur&#x2014;
<quote>"We consider that the Lord Chamberlain would be well advised to proceed with the formation of a Consultative Committee such as he was about to constitute when our inquiry was begun,"</quote>
and the Report goes on to express the hope that no undue delay should occur. And as to the access of authors to the licenser, the Committee declare against the proposal unless the authors as a body desire it. Now my Lords, I have ventured to show that since 1832 successive Committees have held the view that the Office should be in the hands of the Lord Chamberlain, that the Examiner of Plays should continue, and that the Lord Chamberlain should have control; and that position was endorsed and made statutory, as I have pointed out, by the Act of 1843.<lb/>
I desire, as I said just now, to make the position perfectly clear as to where the responsibility rests, and also to make clear the procedure with regard to the office of Lord Chamberlain. Much has been said of the power of the Censor. The whole responsibility rests, not with the reader or the examiner, but with the man who for the
<col>536</col>
time being is Lord Chamberlain. When the Committee reported, they recommended that there should be an Advisory Committee; and as has already been shown by Lord Newton, that Committee was already in process of formation before this Joint Committee was appointed in the days of my predecessor. It naturally took some time to arrange, because the selection of names was by no means easy. There was naturally anxiety to get the very best, possible Advisory Committee together, and when the names had been selected the Lord Chamberlain of the day thought it wise to hang it up for a short time in view of the Parliamentary Committee that had been appointed.<lb/>
Reference has been made to the names of the members of the Advisory Committee&#x2014;Sir Edward Carson, Mr. Buckmaster, Sir Walter Raleigh, Sir Squire Bancroft and Sir Douglas Dawson. Of course, those of us who take an interest in politics know all about Sir Edward Carson and Mr. Buckmaster. They are at or near the head of the learned profession which they adorn. Sir Squire Bancroft has over fifty years' experience of acting and actors, and for a long time was a very successful actor-manager. Sir Walter Raleigh is an Oxford Professor of Literature, and it also happens, as I think my noble friend Lord Newton pointed out, that Sir Douglas Dawson, who as Controller is <i>ex officio</i> a member of this Committee, is in the position of having been in foreign capitals for a large number of years. He also is a profound French and German scholar, and I know that the rest of the Committee have found his knowledge of languages of very great assistance in these matters. Sir John Hare was a member of the Committee until he was reluctantly obliged to resign owing to returning to the stage. Now I venture to say, my Lords, that this Advisory Committee is a body which certainly is entitled to command confidence. My noble friend Lord Ribblesdale asked what constituted a <i>quolum</i>. There is no <i>quorum</i> for this simple reason, that, it would be almost impossible to get these gentlemen to come together at any particular time. I will explain how that is in a moment.<lb/>
I now come to the actual procedure. The play is received by the Lord Chamberlain It is referred to a reader, and comes back to the Lord Chamberlain with a synopsis attached, and I beg to point this out to your
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0294"/>
<col>537</col>
Lordships that it is the play and not the synopsis which is the predominant partner of those two things. A play may appear objectionable as a whole, or certain phrases or passages in it may appear objectionable to the reader. Then the play comes to me, and after I have seen it and been through these objections&#x2014;that is, the play, not the synopsis&#x2014;the play is then circulated to the various members of the Advisory Committee, who furnish me with their views upon the objections. Each member of the Advisory Committee reads the play and attaches his opinion of it in writing, and with the play those opinions are recorded. The play may possibly be so objectionable as a whole that on the advice of the Advisory Committee I should hardly feel justified in giving the licence to it; or the objections to certain phrases or passages may be upheld by the Advisory Committee. Then the usual course would be that I should be advised by them that the play may be licensed subject to the deletion or the alteration of these phrases, and it frequently happens, after correspondence or an interview with the author or with the manager of the theatre, that these objectionable phrases are deleted or changed, and the licence is granted. But supposing that we cannot come to terms, further communications and further interviews take place so as to see if matters can be arranged. If, however, the objectionable phrases are adhered to, the licence can be given subject to the deletion of those phrases, and the licence is so endorsed. But again, my Lords, this may happen, and does happen. The Advisory Committee may advise me that they do not see any objection in the phrases to which the reader may have taken objection, and in that case it is for me to decide whether or not the licence should be granted. I apologise for using the personal pronoun so much, but of course I am referring to the office of the Lord Chamberlain. While we have heard a lot from time to time of the power of the Censor to discard this work and to throw out that work, what I have just said points to this, that the reader's view is not always taken.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01111"><member>LORD RIBBLESDALE</member><membercontribution>: Might I interrupt the noble Lord for one moment? I am afraid he has passed away from my questions. There is one question which he took no notice of&#x2014;not wilfully, of course. The question I asked was whether a manager or an author was allowed to submit any defence to the Advisory Committee.
<col>538</col>
If the Advisory Committee never meets because they can never get a quorum, apparently that would be impossible. Therefore I ask what access has he to the Advisory Committee? Is it only by correspondence?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01112"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SANDHURST</member><membercontribution>: I do not know that he has any access to the Advisory Committee, but he has plenty of opportunity of coming to the Lord Chamberlain, who is the person really responsible for the granting of the licence. It would be almost impossible to get the Advisory Committee to meet, certainly frequently, because the members of it are men of great eminence, and naturally rues of many Occupations which would preclude them from coming together, at any rate often; but, as I said just now, matters frequently are arranged between authors and managers at the Lord Chamberlain's office, and I need hardly say that it is our wish to work this business as sympathetically as we possibly can. I am sorry if my noble friend thought that I overlooked his question, but I thought that it was partially answered by the foregoing sentences.<lb/>
I venture to submit to your Lordships that there can be no indignity in the process I have described. I think indignity was the word used by my noble friend Lord Lytton; but with all the care that I have endeavoured and shall endeavour to exercise in this matter, and seeing, while I do not give away an atom of the responsibility that rests on me, that I have a good and capable Advisory Committee to assist me, I do not think the procedure can be called either arbitrary or autocratic. It will be seen that it is not the exercise of a single opinion as to the propriety or fitness of a play vested in one individual with power to set aside the work of the author. It is not merely the opinion of one man against another. As I have shown, the reader is not the Censor; the reader's opinions have to run the gauntlet of the Advisory Committee, and I can assure my noble friends who have spoken strongly on behalf of authors that the greatest care and thought are bestowed and every effort is made before a decision is come to.<lb/>
Speaking for myself, I certainly am of opinion that there must he a control in these matters by the Lord Chamberlain or by some body. I am quite convinced of that. Various Committees have advised it, and the Act of 1843 endorsed it. The Report suggests certain changes by legisla-
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0295"/>
<col>539</col>
tion. Well, the Report, as I told Lord Plymouth, has not been considered by the Government with a view to legislation, and I think noble Lords would not expect me to commit myself, without further experience at any rate, one way or the other. But perhaps I may be allowed to say two things. One is that, speaking for myself, I do consider that the present plan is prompt and inexpensive. It has the approval and support of the mass of the managers, and I really do believe that on the whole, which is as much as we can say of anything, it has worked well. It is not impossible, on the other hand, that with changes on certain lines suggested there might be greater expense to all parties concerned. There might be found difficulties of working. There might be found insecurity to managers and the vast number of people whom they employ, and there might be considerable delay in settling differences. Beyond those hints I do not say anything, except perhaps that I might be allowed to add that, supposing some alterations in these directions were made, it is not by any means impossible that the alterations might act to the prejudice of the authors themselves. I can well believe that many managers would be chary of accepting plays on certain subjects, and in that way the author's position might be more difficult than before.<lb/>
It has been said that there is a feeling amongst some authors and some men of very distinguished literary ability that their work should not in any way be interfered with. I am afraid I cannot share that view. It cannot be denied, I think, that some protection to the public is necessary as regards stage plays, and also I venture to say in regard to the drama itself. In some quarters there is an assertion that the doors of the Lord Chamberlain's office are closed to authors. I can assure your Lordships that there is no ground whatever for this assertion. I have endeavoured to show, by what I have said about correspondence and interview, that this is contrary to the fact. I can also emphatically say that every play, ether constructed on conventional lines or dealing with interesting problems of human nature by new methods, does receive and will receive equal and unbiassed consideration. I am grateful to your Lordships for your kindness to me on the first occasion that I appear in this capacity. In conclusion, I roust say that it seems to me to be the fact that in dealing with these matters in regard to stage plays
<col>540</col>
and the Censorship the position is very much as in dealing with other delicate matters where the personal question comes in and where control has to be exercised. I certainly can truly say that I most sincerely recognise that these matters have to be dealt with with much patience, with the greatest consideration, and with the most tactful endeavours to satisfy those with whom we come in contact, and with the aid of the advisers who are at my disposal I shall endeavour to work on these lines.</membercontribution></p>

<title>IRISH CREAMERIES AND DAIRY<lb/> PRODUCE BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01114"><sup>*</sup><member>THE PAYMASTER-GENERAL (LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I ask leave to submit for First Reading a Bill dealing with the important butter industry in Ireland. Your Lordships will no doubt be aware that the creameries in Ireland produce a very large percentage&#x2014;roughly one-half&#x2014;of the total output of butter, and Irish creamery butter has enjoyed a high reputation. Perhaps on that account it has been subjected to various frauds in both England and Ireland, and owing to the absence of any statutory definition of what creamery butter is, it has been found impossible to secure convictions in the Courts for those frauds under the Merchandise Marks Act. The first thing to do is to clearly establish a definition, and that is done in the Bill. The definition follows the recommendation of a Departmental Committee which sat during the years 1908 and 1909. The definition secures that creamery butter must be manufactured from cream which has been separated from milk on premises registered as a creamery or cream separating station by means of centrifugal force applied by mechanical power, or which has been supplied from a registered cream-separating station. That defines what Irish creamery butter is.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0296"/>
<col>541</col>
Clause 2 provides for the registration of creameries, and such a register will be kept by the Department of Agriculture in Ireland. Then there are certain conditions under which creameries can be registered. I may say that all existing creameries will be entitled to be registered, so that no hardship should arise in regard to any existing creamery. There is another thing which has militated very much against the butter industry in Ireland. It arises from the fact that during some months of the year there is very little milk to be obtained in Ireland owing to the absence of winter dairies, and many of the creameries have been forced to close; but some creameries have resorted to the practice of importing foreign and colonial butter, or even of purchasing butter from the farmers in the market, and issuing that butter without a proper description indicating that it is not butter made in the creamery and not really creamery butter at all. The Bill will provide that it will be an offence to issue butter of this kind without a proper description, and especially requiring that there shall be a distinct and sufficient indication that such butter is not Trish creamery butter.<lb/>
There is another provision with regard to unclean milk. Complaint is very generally made that impure milk is supplied to these creameries. Of course, the introduction of any impure milk into a creamery can ruin the entire output of the creamery for that day. I may say the difficulty is that if one creamery manager refuses to take such
<col>542</col>
milk, competition is so keen that the milk can be easily disposed of to another creamery. The managers of the creameries are themselves the servants of the suppliers, and therefore it is extremely difficult for them to know what means they can adopt to deal with this evil. The Bill proposes to make the supplying of unclean milk and butter an offence. Those are the main provisions. The rest of the Bill deals with penalties and interpretations and general machinery. The Bill has been submitted to all the associations connected with the butter industry in Ireland and its principles have been approved. The Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, the Irish Butter Trade Association, and the Irish Creamery Managers' Association have all signified their approval of tie principles of the Bill, reserving to themselves, however, the right to get Amendments moved by those who represent them, if they see tit, on the Committee stage. I think this will be generally admitted to be a useful measure, and I hope your Lordships will give it a First Reading to-night and allow me to put it down for Second Reading on a day soon after Easter.</membercontribution></p>

<title>LLANBRADACH SCHOOL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01122"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF PORTSMOUTH</member> rose to call attention to a correspondence between the managers of the Llanbradach non-provided school and the Board of Education; and to ask His Majesty's Government for an explanation of the delay.</p>
<col>544</col>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01123">The noble Earl said: My Lords, in calling attention to the case of the Llanbradach non-provided school, I am glad to be able to assure your Lordships that the correspondence to which I shall he obliged to refer is not a lengthy one, but as the whole of it affects this question very directly I think I must deal with each letter. The correspondence in regard to this matter commenced on June 21, 1911. A letter was then written by Mr. Edwards, the correspondent of the school, complaining that the four certificated teachers at the Llanbradach non-provided school are paid salaries lower than those paid by the local education letter that the managers had already made several applications to the local education authority in vain, and that they now felt it their duty formally to appeal to the Board of Education under Section 7 of the Act of 1902. To that letter the only reply received from the Board of Education was a bare acknowledgment upon a postcard.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01124">Mr. Edwards made a second application. He wrote again on December 1, 1911. To that application the official reply was again a bare acknowledgment upon a postcard. Then Mr. Edwards made a third application. He wrote the following letter on January 9 of this year to the Secretary of the Board of Education&#x2014;
<quote>"The managers desire the decision of the Board of Education upon an appeal dated June 21 last year regarding the salaries of certificated teachers. We cannot understand this long delay. Meanwhile our teachers are leaving us for posts in provided schools."</quote>
That is a rather remarkable correspondence on the part of the Board of Education&#x2014;certainly most economical both in courtesy and in the extent of any information at all. When this was brought to my notice I took a great deal of trouble to ascertain how the matter stood as regards the efficiency of this particular school, and I find, upon careful investigation, that this is not an inefficient or what may be called a small or trumpery school. The average attendance of children during the last year was 360, the school has always earned the highest grants, and the reports of His Majesty's inspector have been satisfactory. I do not wish to trouble your Lordships by quoting all the reports of recent years, but I will read an extract from the last report&#x2014;
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0298"/>
<col>545</col>
namely, the report for 1910. This is what His Majesty's inspector says&#x2014;
<quote>"The general management is marked by much intelligence, and die head teacher deserves credit for his success in maintaining the efficiency of the school in difficult circumstances."</quote>
The circumstances are certainly very difficult, when it appears that it has been the policy of the local education authority, more or less connived at by the Board of Education, to refuse to give the teachers in this school their proper salaries.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01125">As I say, the school has earned the highest grants, and the reports of His Majesty's inspector have been satisfactory. I have also ascertained that the school authorities have carried out all the improvements and repairs that the Board of Education desired, and that they are not in any default at all. I am not open to the charge that I am in any way ecclesiastically minded, but it does seem to me that in regard to the treatment of this school fair and equitable administration and consideration by the local education authority should be maintained. The first letter written by Mr. Edwards to the Board of Education was dated June, 1911. On April 6, 1911, the Swansea judgment was given. That judgment was unanimous. I do not desire to trespass upon your Lordships' indulgence by reading that judgment at any length, but it bears so very much upon the peculiarities of this particular case that I should like to read part of the judgment. The Lord Chancellor, in the Swansea judgment, made use of this language&#x2014;
<quote>"In some of the judgments in the Courts below it is affirmed, as a matter of law, that under this Act a local authority is not entitled to differentiate between schools in regard to the scale of salaries or the standard of efficiency in the absence of special circumstances appropriate to the differentiation. If a local authority does differentiate without such circumstances, it would be cogent evidence of an intention to starve the less favoured school, but it would he no more than evidence of such an intention all the more cogent if the discrimination were due to political or to sectarian prepossessions. I do not find anything, however, in the Statute itself which prohibits the local authority front doing for some schools more than it does for others even if the circumstances are indistinguishable."</quote>
But the noble and learned Earl went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"At the same time, I must observe that such treatment is a strong circumstance which the Board of Education are bound to scrutinise, in order to satisfy themselves that the discrimination does not involve any lowering of the proper standard of efficiency in the schools for which less is done."</quote>
<col>546</col>
It is perfectly clear, therefore, that in the Swansea judgment three things are maintained as self-evident&#x2014;that is to say, the local education authority must act impartially, its discrimination must not be due to political or to sectarian prepossessions, and its discrimination must not involve the lowering of the proper standard of efficiency in the school. Those are the Lord Chancellor's own words; and my noble and learned friend Lord Shaw, who also was one of the Law Lords adjudicating upon this matter, said&#x2014;
<quote>"I do not doubt that the local education authority must act impartially."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01126">The facts which have come to my notice, and which I have ventured to bring before your Lordships this afternoon, certainly convey to me, and I think will convey to all impartial minds, the feeling that in regard to this matter the local education authority must have been actuated by political and sectarian prepossessions, and that the result of their action&#x2014;I confess it seems to me a very mean and shabby action&#x2014;in not granting adequate salaries to the teachers in this school does and must involve the lowering of the proper standard of efficiency in the school. I have stated the facts as they are. What is the official explanation? The President of the Board of Education wrote a letter to <i>The Times</i> on February 28 in which lie made an apology in regard to this matter. He said that the great pressure of work consequent on his appointment, and the fact that his attention had not been directed to this matter until the last day of the autumn session, had prevented him from being able to give a definite reply in regard to it, and he expressed the opinion that before he could adjudicate upon the matter he must ascertain the facts, and that for this purpose it might be necessary to hold a public inquiry or series of public inquiries. That is a very good apology as regards the present President of the Board, but in making a good case for himself he entirely gave away the case of his predecessor. I admit that so far as the present President of the Board of Education is concerned he made a good case, but the Education Office must be a most extraordinary public Department if questions affecting schools are hung up for an indefinite time in this way, and do not receive any consideration or courtesy at all.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01127">All the applications made by Mr. Edwards were merely acknowledged upon a postcard.
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0299"/>
<col>547</col>
No reason was given, and it really is a monstrous thing that schools of this or of any kind should be left indefinitely in this position. That is the case of this particular school, and I wish to ask His Majesty's Government whether they will give us, not only an explanation as to why there has been this extraordinary delay on the part of the Board of Education in treating this matter seriously or in considering it in a business way, but some assurance that this matter is not going to be delayed any longer. The delay, to my mind, has been a gross scandal, and has resulted in a grave injustice as regards the particular teachers in this school.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01128"><member>THE FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am glad to think that in this matter the chief facts, as enumerated by the noble Earl opposite, are not in dispute between us. The Board of Education recognise fully the efficiency of the school to which the noble Earl has referred, and neither with regard to that nor with regard to the principle is there really any serious difference between the two sides of the House. It is really more a matter of Departmental administration. The noble Earl somewhat cursorily, but accurately, referred to the fact that there have been changes in the Board of Education within the last few months. Your Lordships know that there was a new President appointed. This, of course, involved some delays in matters brought before the head of the Department. Then after the new President came into office there was a change with regard to the Permanent Secretary of the Board, because Sir Robert Morant accepted a position under the National Insurance Act. Soon afterwards, or at the same time, another important official of the Department accepted a post outside the Education Office; and these three changes, as any of your Lordships who have had experience of Departmental administration will recognise, led to considerable dislocation of business inside the Office.<lb/>
As the noble Earl informed your Lordships, the matter was brought seriously before the attention of the President of the Board at the end, of the last session of Parliament. The President considered the matter during the recess. Orders were given at the end of January that informal communication should be opened up with the
<col>548</col>
authorities concerned, and on February 5 and 13 the letters of complaint which had been received from the managers were forwarded to the authorities. The President has been informed within the course of the last month by the Glamorganshire Local Education Committee, in whose area this particular school lies, that they are fully prepared in respect of two of the non-provided schools&#x2014;subject to the teachers entering into agreements with the Council&#x2014;to comply so far as the Act and their own agreements allow with the conditions of service in these schools, and to settle the salaries of the teachers in accordance with the standard observed in the provided schools. With reference to this particular school, the sub-committee in charge of the matter recommended, at their meeting on Thursday last, that the Board of Education should be informed that the committee would be prepared to deal on the merits with applications for increases of salary subject to reasonable improvements in the premises being carried out by the managers, the committee to take into consideration whether the managers will allow the teachers to agree to observe and comply with the committee's regulations. This communication has been referred to the Board, who are now taking legal advice on the position created by that decision.<lb/>
The President of the Board wishes me to say that he hopes that satisfactory arrangements may be arrived at without its becoming necessary either to hold an inquiry or to take any further steps. I feel that there is no necessity to assure your Lordships that the Government are as anxious as any noble Lords opposite to see that the law is observed, and if there is proved to be any breach of the law steps will be immediately taken to enforce it. I hope that this recital of the events which have happened so recently will satisfy the noble Earl that, although there has been some delay, which we regret, owing to the changes in the Office which I have already described, the matter is now seriously taken in hand by the President of the Board; and if the results of his action are not thought to be satisfactory to the noble Earl, I trust that he will raise the Question again at a later date, when the results of the action which has so recently been taken by the local education authority will be fully available for the information of your Lordships, and you will then be in possession of the full facts of the case.</membercontribution></p>

<col>549</col>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01129"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to say a single word about this matter. I should be sorry to comment unfairly upon the fact of the delay alluded to by the noble Earl who brought forward this subject, in view of the apologia that has been offered on the ground first of all that the offices of President of the Board of Education and then of Chief Permanent Secretary had passed to different hands during the intervening months. If this case stood entirely alone and that was the explanation offered we should desire, hard as it is upon the individuals affected, to give the kindliest possible licence to the Department. But, my Lords, it is not an isolated case.<lb/>
What we have to complain of in these matters, not in this case alone but in others, is that there is an apparent disregard of the immense practical and tangible harm that is being done to poor teachers by the long delay which arises in the settlement of these matters, in which, it is true, only a few pounds are at issue, but those few pounds are of vital importance to the persons concerned. In this particular case the head teacher of the infants' school has, I believe, a salary of&#x00A3;70 a year, whereas the corresponding teacher in the Council school in the same neighbourhood receives&#x00A3;120 a year. The attention of the local education authority was called to this last spring. The local education authority did not meet the representations which had been made, and the Board of Education then had their attention called to the matter on June 21 of last year. We are now at the end of March, and, to take a single example out of several, the lady who receives a salary of&#x00A3;70 a year as compared with the corresponding salary of&#x00A3;120 in the Council school has been suffering that loss during the whole of these intervening months. It is urged upon us by way of explanation that that particular grievance could not be set right because the Presidency of the Board of Education and then the Permanent Secretaryship changed hands. It strikes me as somewhat startling in the case of a great Department like the Board of Education if that really is the explanation.<lb/>
I do not underrate for a moment the difficulties of the Board of Education, in present circumstances, in Wales and perhaps elsewhere with regard to troubles of this kind. But the question is not a new one. It did not require to be thought out for the first time. It is a matter which has been before the Board before, which was
<col>550</col>
thoroughly threshed out in the Swansea case, and which was familiar to the whole of the staff at the Board. I do venture to hope that if we accept now as adequate the explanation that has been given&#x2014;that the changes that have taken place in the Board are the real reason why this matter has not been attended to before&#x2014;principles will as soon as possible be laid down which can be rather more speedily put into operation in the future so that such delays as this may not occur. To some members of this House the evil and loss incurred may seem insignificant, but they are wrongs of a formidable kind to the humbler individuals who are practically affected, and who look to this House for the relief which is required.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01130"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am bound to say, if the most rev. Primate will allow me, that he has taken a very generous and lenient view of the action of the Board of Education in this matter. He has told us that to a certain extent he accepts the explanation given by the noble Earl&#x2014;namely, that there had been changes in the Board. I myself was President of the Board a Education and many changes took place in the first few months that I was there, but I should never have ignored for Party purposes any matter that came before me or have made such an excuse as has been made to-day for delay. There can be no question that one of the reasons for the delay in this matter was the fact that one of the Ministers who represent the Board of Education had no friendly feeling towards this school at Llanbradach.<lb/>
Although the fact that the present President of the Board is new to his duties may be taken as an excuse for so many months having been allowed to go by without the letters in connection with this school having been answered, I should like the noble Earl to tell me what Mr. Runciman was doing from the month of June last year, when the first application was made to him, till the end of October when he left the Department. He cannot deny that he was approached on this matter. The noble Earl has read the letters. Therefore I should like to hear from the noble Lord who will reply to me what was Mr. Runciman's reason for taking no notice whatever of the letters of the board of managers on this matter. As a result hardship has been brought to bear on the teachers of this school, whose salaries have for so long been kept below the level of those in the Council schools.<lb/>
I notice that correspondence took place
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0301"/>
<col>551</col>
only a short time ago between the Board of Education and the managers of the Llanbradach school, and I find that Mr. Trevelyan, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board, in March, in defending the Department's inaction, said that the Board had something else to do with the local authorities than to quarrel with them over religion. I venture to say that a statement such as that is unworthy of a Minister representing the Board of Education, and I should be glad to hear from whoever follows me how he can justify such a sentence as that. This I venture to think explains the partisan character of the action of the Board of Education in connection with this school. The dispute in question is not over any matter of religion. It is over the question of the salaries of the teachers. Those teachers have to carry out the instructions given them by the managers, and if they did not do so they would not be retained in their places. Therefore to deal with these teachers in this manner is most unfair and unjustifiable. I must say that when listening to the speech of the noble Earl in which he endeavoured to account for the delay that had taken place I could not help contrasting the hurry of the Government at the present moment to establish a minimum wage for coal miners with their unwillingness to secure a minimum wage to teachers in denominational schools. I hope this matter will be inquired into, and I trust that we shall not in the future have an example of such partisan action brought before the attention of your Lordships.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01131"><sup>*</sup><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Marquess speaks as though it were a simple and easy matter to get over the difficulties which have arisen and which do arise in cases like this. No one knows better than himself, from his own experience when he presided over the Board of Education, what those difficulties are in Wales and in other parts of the country&#x2014;difficulties which arise from causes into which I need not enter now. I have only to say that the Board of Education are anxious to see that the law is complied with, that they are using the means in their power which they think most likely to lead to a speedy settlement of the matter in dispute, that to resort to more hurried and violent means would probably defeat the purpose they have in view, and that they are endeavouring as rapidly as they can to get rid of a very difficult situation, as to which they have good hope that the difficulties will shortly be surmounted.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE ARMY.</title>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01132"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member> had the following Notice on the Paper&#x2014;</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01133">To call attention to the statement of the Secretary of State for War on the 20th February 1912, "I never reduced any home battalions; what I did was to reduce the battalions abroad." (Official Report, 20th February, page 119.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01134">To ask the Secretary of State for War to define a home battalion of the Regular Army.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01135">To call attention to the number of troops left in the United Kingdom in the event of the departure abroad of the six Divisions of the Expeditionary Force.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01136">The noble Duke said: My Lords, in the first Question which I have placed on the Paper I ask the noble Viscount to kindly explain to me what is exactly a home battalion of the Regular Army, and I ask the question for this reason. On February last the noble Viscount told us&#x2014;
<quote>"I never reduced any home battalions; what I did was to reduce battalions abroad."</quote>
That statement leaves me at a loss to understand what the noble Viscount means by a "home battalion." I have always regarded the Guards as home battalions, in the sense that they were stationed at home, but the noble Viscount has disbanded one Guards battalion and has sent another abroad. The result is a reduction of two home battalions. But, of course, the Guards are on a different footing for foreign service from the Line. A Line battalion stationed at home is referred to as the home battalion. The noble Viscount told us he never reduced any home battalions; but, on referring to the Army List for March, 1906, I find that four out of the eight Line battalions reduced were stationed at home at that moment; so I am puzzled to know what the noble Viscount means by a "home battalion," and before dealing with battalions left at home I venture to ask the noble Viscount, to define a "home battalion."</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01137"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Duke has asked me a question which I think I can answer without very much difficulty if he will allow me to refer to what I said on the occasion which his question touches. In the debate in the other House on March 8, 1906, I pointed out in some
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0302"/>
<col>553</col>
detail that battalions at home fed battalions abroad, and I said that I should be guilty of an act of lunacy if I reduced battalions at home. The words I used were these&#x2014;
<quote>"If you pass from <i>personnel</i> to units you find that whereas in 1896&#x2013;7 there were 142 battalions of the Line, to-day there are 156 battalions, a very substantial increase."</quote>
Some had been put on under the administration of the noble Marquess opposite for general purposes, and others had been put on for the purposes of the war. I continued&#x2014;
<quote>"And of them [that is, of the 156 battalions] only 71 are at home against 85 abroad."</quote>
The noble Duke will appreciate the significance of that&#x2014;
<quote>"Looking a little more closely into the details of the increase, I find to-day that the Guards have been increased by 3 battalions and that 14 battalions of the Line have been added between 1807&#x2013;8 and the present time. That is to say, we have 17 more battalions to-day than we had at that time, and the whole increase of 14 units of the Line has been used for the purposes of arrangements abroad."</quote>
Then I went on&#x2014;
<quote>"There was a rumour the other day in the papers that I had decided to recommend the abolition of 10 home battalions of the Line. I tried to describe that rumour correctly as a <i>nidus equinus,</i> which is a polite and classic way of calling it a 'mare's nest.' If I had decided to do anything of that kind, it would have been in military eyes tantamount to insanity. For many years past we have been working in this country under what is called the Cardwell system, and the theory of this system is that the best way of training your recruits is to link your battalion at home with the battalion abroad&#x2026;The result of our system of training is that our battalions at home in time of peace are nurseries or training schools for supplying troops to India and the Colonies. In time of war it is different."</quote>
That is what I said at that time, and the answer as to what a home battalion means is that it is a feeding battalion&#x2014;a battalion which is there for the purpose of keeping alive and supplying with seasoned men a battalion which is abroad. On July 19, 1906, I explained it all over again, and if the noble Duke wishes to have the details he will find them in the report of the debate which took place in the other House on that day. As regards the Guards, there was a reduction of one battalion, but it was made for quite another reason, which was admirably explained by the noble Earl opposite (Lord Portsmouth) who was at that time Under-Secretary of State for War in Sir
<col>554</col>
Henry Campbell-Bannerman's Administration. Lord Portsmouth then said&#x2014;
<quote>"I now come to the question of the Guards. The noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, when he occupied the position of Secretary of State for War in February, 1897, in order to justify the increase of the G cards used these words: 'It must, however, be clearly understood that we are able to recommend this increase and to justify the expenditure which it involves only upon condition that we are allowed to make arise of the brigade to help us in overcoming our difficulties, and to require from it a reasonable contribution towards the relief of the present strain on the Army system.'"</quote>
The noble Earl went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"But this purpose was never fulfilled&#x2026;They are not required for the Expeditionary Force, and they have no share in that other great duty of the Army at home&#x2014;the providing of drafts for the forces that garrison the outposts of the Empire."</quote>
The result of that view, which was expressed on July 26, 1906, and which exactly stated the policy, was that I battalion of the Guards was reduced and I was sent to Egypt. As I have said, in 1906&#x2013;7 the position of matters was this: there were at home 10 battalions of Guards and only 71 battalions of the Line, and 85 battalions of the Line were in South Africa and other Colonies, in Egypt, and in India. In 1907&#x2013;8 the position had not even then been got right. There were at home still 8 battalions of the Guards; 71 battalions of the Line were at home and 77 abroad. That was after the reduction of 8 battalions of the Line and I of the Guards had taken place. In 1908&#x2013;9 the position was no better, because in consequence of disturbances in China an extra battalion had to be sent there. There were 70 battalions of the Line and 8 battalions of the Guards at home; there was in Egypt I battalion of the Guards, and there were 78 battalions of the Line abroad. But in 1909&#x2013;10 we got the policy completely carried out and established the Cardwell balance. The result was that in 1909&#x2013;10 the state of things was established which exists at the present time&#x2014;namely, 8 battalions of the Guards were at home and I battalion abroad; 74 battalions of the Line were at home and 74 battalions of the Line abroad. I have now, I think, explained entirely what I mean by home battalions, and I have told the noble Duke what the state of things now is as compared with the previous state of things. I do not know whether the noble Duke wishes me to deal with the second part of his Question now, or whether he would prefer to say something upon it before I reply.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0303"/>
<col>555</col>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01138"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member><membercontribution>: I am obliged to the noble Viscount for his answer to my first Question. But four battalions of the Line were at home when they were reduced. Were they not feeding battalions If 74 battalions of the Line are at home and 74 abroad the noble Viscount seems to think that that balance adds greatly to the safety of the United Kingdom. Personally I should have thought that if we had 84 battalions at home and 74 abroad we would have been in a stronger position.<lb/>
I will now proceed to the second part of my Question, which is to call attention to the number of troops left in the United Kingdom in the event of the departure abroad of the six Divisions of the Expeditionary Force. By the statement based on mobilisation returns dated June 1, 1911, the number of troops left at home after the departure of the six Divisions of the Expeditionary Force is given at 410,000. The noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War speaking at a distribution of prizes to Territorials at Edinburgh on January 8, 1911, is reported to have thus described this force&#x2014;
<quote>"If the whole of the Regular Expeditionary Force of this country were out of the country, we should still have 410,000 men left trained and organised for defence. We should have 100,000 of the Third battalions. Then there are the Regulars, Royal Engineers, and Garrison Artillery, the Territorials, coast defence troops, and finally there is a central force organised so as to proceed swiftly to whatever point is attacked."</quote>
The 410,000 men described by the noble Viscount as trained and organised for the defence of the United Kingdom convey the impression of a great Army with a full complement of officers and men more than sufficient for all our needs. But when we come to examine these numbers in detail matters are by no means so satisfactory.<lb/>
On the departure of the six Divisions we shall be left with four Regular Infantry battalions, three Regular Cavalry regiments, eight Royal Horse Artillery batteries, and nine Field Artillery batteries. These are the only organised units of Regular Artillery, Cavalry, and Infantry left at home. There are besides shown on the Return many Regular details which in non-military language may be described as "odds and ends" and of no manner of use for a field Army. The noble Viscount told us on November 20 last that the central field force is organised partly of Territorial units
<col>556</col>
and partly of Regular units. If the noble Viscount carries out this combination of Regular and non-Regular forces to which he is pledged, he can hardly do so with less than one Regular Infantry Brigade and three Cavalry regiments. We see, therefore, that all the Regular Cavalry and all the Regular Infantry battalions surplus to the requirements of the Expeditionary Force must be included in the central field force. That means that there will be no Regular Cavalry regiments or Regular Infantry battalions in Ireland, or in Scotland where there are important naval bases. London will be left without a single Regular Infantry battalion or regiment of Cavalry at a moment when the ranks of the Police are weakened by calling out the Army Reserve and the stress and strain of a great war are upon us. I do not believe that any Government will ever allow such a state of affairs. It shows the futility of talking about sending six Divisions abroad.<lb/>
We have recently had some remarkable experiences at home which it would be folly to ignore. His Majesty's Government have employed troops in aid of the Civil power six times between June 26, 1907, and February 9, 1912. We have learnt by experience that we have in London a large hostile alien population. The First Lord of the Admiralty, when Home Secretary, took the field, or rather the pavement, in person not very long ago and was present at an engagement in Stepney, when he witnessed the discharge of some hundreds of rounds of ball ammunition down the streets of the metropolis. But far more serious were the events of last August. At that time His Majesty's Government found themselves compelled to employ a large number of troops in aid of the Civil power. The noble Viscount, speaking in your Lordships' House on August 22 said, in reference to the state of affairs then prevailing&#x2014;
<quote>"It is obvious that even so, and even with the 58,000 troops we had at our disposal and ready, all of whom it was not necessary to use but the greater part of whom were used, it obviously was not possible to cover every point."</quote>
Now the disturbed area was then limited to England and Wales. No troops were used in aid of the Civil power in Scotland, although troops were used and in considerable numbers at a later date in Ireland.<lb/>
No one would seriously contend that internal disturbance cannot synchronise with external war. The probabilities are
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0304"/>
<col>557</col>
the reverse. We are bound, therefore, to consider what troops would be available to aid the Civil power after the departure of the Expeditionary Force. First come the Regular troops. By the plan of the noble Viscount to which he is committed, their place is in the central field force which is to swoop swiftly down on any point attacked. They cannot form the backbone of the central field force and at the same time be detached hither and thither to aid the Civil power. Again, their numbers are wholly insufficient. Why on February 8 last, there were seven Infantry battalions to say nothing of other troops employed in aid of the Civil power in Belfast alone, to enable a Cabinet Minister to deliver a speech in time of profound peace, and we are to be left with only four battalions during the excitement and tension of a great war. We know by experience, and by the statement of the noble Viscount, that last August the numerical equivalent of two Divisions was not sufficient to cover the whole ground when the area of disturbance was limited to England and Wales. Instead, of the equivalent of two Divisions we are to be left with four battalions and throe Regular Cavalry regiments none of whom can be detached front the central field force, and none of whom are consequently available for duty in aid of the Civil power.<lb/>
Next come the Third and Fourth Battalions of the Special Reserve. I will take the officer question first. The number of officers who remain at home must depend upon the number sent abroad. The noble Viscount has to make good a shortage of 600 Regular Infantry officers in the battalions of the Expeditionary Force previous to their embarkation. He proposes to draw upon the Regular officers attached to the Special Reserve for this purpose. The noble Viscount drew a distinction the other day between the Third and Fourth Battalions of the Special Reserve. In answer to Lord Midleton he said&#x2014;
<quote>"They will be taken from the 74 battalions which do not go abroad. They will be the 74 battalions at the dep&#x00F4;ts whose function is largely that of training though they do defence work. It is not like taking them from a unit which is going abroad."</quote>
The Fourth Battalions are to go abroad; the noble Viscount has often told us that; consequently they cannot be available for home defence. On the point of officers, there is another reason which must have
<col>558</col>
influenced the noble Viscount when he told us on March 6 that&#x2014;
<quote>"He was not going to take the Regular officers from the Fourth Battalions who are to go abroad,"</quote>
namely, that he had done so already. All Regular officers have been withdrawn from the Fourth Battalions with the exception of the adjutants and the quartermasters. So much for the Fourth Battalions.<lb/>
Each Third Battalion has five Regular Company officers, which gives a total of 370 available to meet the deficit of 600, leaving a shortage of 230 to be made good by another call on another Reserve of Officers before the Expeditionary Force sails. The noble Viscount stated on March 6 that&#x2014;
<quote>"In the Reserve of Officers there were at present 791 Infantry officers after allowing 40 per cent. for officers who for various reasons may not be forthcoming. That figure by itself would wipe out the 595."</quote>
But what is the real state of the case? There are at present in the Reserve of Infantry officers 129 captains and 38 subalterns who are resident in the United Kingdom and not now serving in any military force and have not left the Army more than three years. These 167 are the only officers in the Reserve of Officers qualified and available for duty as company officers in the battalions of the Expeditionary Force, but 167 is a very different figure from 791 and will not wipe out the deficit of 600. By drawing upon these Reserve officers and by making a clean sweep of all Regular company officers attached to the Third Special Reserve Battalions the noble Viscount cannot make good the deficit of 600 Regular Infantry officers for the Expeditionary Force, but must again draw on some other sources. There is but one other possible source of supply for officers sailing with the Expeditionary Force and who are to command companies in action within a fortnight of rejoining, and that is to take Regular officers away from Territorial battalions. Does the noble Viscount mean to do that? I hope he does. I think it is the only plan, because any other will wreck the Infantry of the Expeditionary Force by sending them into their first great action, upon which so much will depend, under the command of a lot of incompetent officers.<lb/>
But then how are we going to be left at home for infantry officers? That is a
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0305"/>
<col>559</col>
question for the noble Viscount to explain, but I am afraid he will have to rely largely upon that class which he described the other day as&#x2014;
<quote>"the people who in the case of the South African war came forward without being under any obligation to do so, and often rendered very useful service."</quote>
The Third Battalions of the Special Reserve are to absorb all immature Line soldiers and incapable Reservists, and are estimated by the noble Viscount at a total strength of 100,000 men. Of these 50,000 are Special Reservists, and according to the estimate of the noble Viscount 55,000 are Regulars, but Regulars who are immature boys from the Colours&#x2014;of these there will be upwards of 30,000&#x2014;and unsound men from the Regular Reserve and the Line. These battalions are to act as fixed garrisons for the defence of naval ports. How can a fixed garrison move about the country in aid of the Civil power? Then they are to train recruits; but how can they train recruits when their instructors, the Regular officers, have been removed? These battalions, by their composition as well as by the duties assigned to them, are quite impossible for duty in aid of the Civil power or yet for home defence. Besides, the noble Viscount has told us that the Third Battalions of the Special Reserve are not for mobilisation. They form a large drafting pool. All the same the noble Viscount at Edinburgh included these 100,000 men amongst his list of troops trained and organised for defence. Their training is of the slightest; their organisation for defence, without an adequate supply of officers and non-commissioned officers, without transport and without any Brigade organisation, is <i>nil.</i> Before leaving the Special Reserve I would observe that the Return includes the 27 Fourth Battalions who must by the plan of the noble Viscount go abroad; that means a decrease of 15,000. Then the first contingent of drafts must leave, if not at the same time immediately after the Expeditionary Force for the base overseas; that means another 15,000 gone abroad&#x2014;a drop of 30,000 all told. Again, the Return is calculated at a moment when the Regular Reserve is at its highest, but the Army Annual Return tells us that the first class Regular Reserve will drop by 40,000 men before the end of next year.<lb/>
Lastly, we come to the Territorial Army, which would, of course, be embodied.
<col>560</col>
Many questions have been asked as to the legal liability of the Territorial soldier being used in aid of the Civil power. On March 16, 1909, the noble Viscount was asked whether the men of the Territorial Army could be used to aid the Civil power to put down strikes or any kind of disturbances, and he replied&#x2014;
<quote>"The Territorial soldier can be called upon to aid the Civil power only when he is under military law on the occasions set forth in Section 176 (6a) of the Army Act. The hon. Member must be well aware, from the full explanation I have given on the subject, that the Territorial Force cannot be called out or embodied in whole or in part in aid of the Civil power for the purpose of putting down riots or disturbances."</quote>
The noble Viscount has referred us in this answer to that section of the Army Act which governs the Territorial Force in its duties in aid of the Civil power. Under the Army Act the Territorial Force can be used in aid of the Civil power when out for training or when embodied on permanent service. A man in the Territorial Force is a soldier enlisted under Section 10 of the Army Act, and when out for training or on embodied service is in precisely the same position as a soldier in the Regular Army except that the Territorial soldier cannot be sent out of the United Kingdom; that is the only difference. The question is, Do His Majesty's Government propose to use the Territorial Force in aid of the Civil power in the absence of the Expeditionary Force? For they have no other military force available. If they do intend to use the Territorial Army for this purpose they should inform the country and the officers and men of the Force. I should not wonder if this particular use of the Territorial Force came as a surprise to both. For this I cannot help thinking that the noble Viscount's answer, which I have already quoted, is partly responsible. The noble Viscount said that the Territorial Force cannot be called out or embodied in whole or in part in aid of the Civil power for the purpose of putting down riots or disturbances. That statement by itself has only one meaning&#x2014;namely, you cannot use the Territorial Force in aid of the Civil power. But read it with the section of the Army Act quoted by the noble Viscount and it will mean the opposite. The country and many members of the Territorial Force do not trouble to read up subsections of the Army Act even when they are given a reference, and consequently have misapprehended the true meaning of the noble Viscount's statement. I cannot conceive
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0306"/>
<col>561</col>
any Government using the Territorial Army in aid of the Civil power, but the Civil power cannot be left unaided and unsupported. The question is what force is to discharge the duties in aid of the Civil power in time of war for which 58,000 men of the Regular Army were found insufficient in the limited area of England and Wales in time of peace.<lb/>
The noble Viscount has already contemplated the impossibility of his own plan of sending all six Divisions abroad at one time, because on November 20 last he told us that&#x2014;
<quote>"arrangements are also made to include in the central force two Divisions of the Regular Army if, when the necessity for taking expeditionary action arises, the Territorial Force is not considered capable of undertaking the duties of home defence without the aid of Regular troops."</quote>
It is perfectly certain that such few Divisions of the Territorial Army which would be available to act as a field force cannot undertake to meet Continental troops without the help of far more than four Regular battalions, three regiments of Cavalry, and eight batteries of Horse Artillery. Two Divisions of Regular troops must remain for the central force and for aiding the Civil power.<lb/>
Then as to the garrison of Ireland. I wish the noble Viscount would tell us if he really means to garrison Ireland in time of war by means of the boys of the Territorial Army, stiffened by the National Reserve but unaided by any Regular force. I am sure that the National Reserve will add a very stiff element to the Territorial Army. But I am not sure if the National Reserve is liable for service in Ireland. Perhaps the noble Viscount would tell us. Of course, common sense tells one that one Regular Division must remain in Ireland, so that three Divisions will be available for the Expeditionary Force. In conclusion I ask, What is the use of going on talking about a striking force of six Divisions when you know quite well you cannot strike with those six Divisions?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01139"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF PORTSMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: Before the noble Viscount replies, perhaps I might be allowed to put to him one or two questions with regard to the condition of the force which would remain behind provided the whole of the six Divisions of the Expeditionary Force had gone abroad. I will assume that you have
<col>562</col>
410,000 troops of sorts left in this country. Let us suppose that of that number you have 260,000 Territorials. Now the Territorial Army is organised, but I wish to ask the noble Viscount a question specially in reference to the remaining 150,000 men composed of Regulars and of Special Reservists. As far as I understand, these 150,000 men have no mobilisation equipment. I am not aware that there is any war establishment for these battalions. As regards horses, Colonel Seely stated in another place that the Expeditionary Force would require on mobilisation 44,000 horses and the Territorial Force 84,000 horses. But so far as I can discover, he made no allowance for the 8 Horse Artillery batteries of Regulars and the 33 field batteries of the Special Reserve and Regulars which will be left over in this country. I want to know how that matter stands, and how we stand as regards horses for the equipment of these men who will be left behind. Of course, 410,000 men may seem to the public a very large number of soldiers, and naturally they say, "This Army of 410,000 would be well able to deal with a possible invasion of 70,000 men." But, after all, we want to know that these 410,000 men are properly equipped and organised for mobilisation. I take it that they will largely form part of enormous dep&#x00F4;ts. It is obvious that when the Expeditionary Force leaves there must be considerable drains upon officers, and it would be interesting if the noble Viscount were able to give us some figures which would show what the Infantry portion of these 150,000 men is in numbers of officers and men excluding, of course, Garrison Artillery and Engineers. In other words, I hope that the noble Viscount may be able to tell us what mobilisation equipment there is for these 410,000 men. How would they be able to act? Would they be able to act as a military force, or would they be merely a mob of soldiers in dep&#x00F4;ts?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01140"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Duke raised some questions about officers which I think are scarcely covered by the terms of his Notice on the Paper, which relates to troops left at home. The other day, however, he raised the same question and I then gave him a very full statement of officers, which included some sources that he has not mentioned. My statement appears in <i>Hansard,</i> and I would refer the noble Duke to it. As regards the other
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0307"/>
<col>563</col>
matters to which he alluded, they come within the terms of the Notice standing in his name on the Paper, and I will answer them. The noble Duke has been haunted by many nightmares, some of which are more serious than others. He has made many permutations and combinations to show what a terrible position we might be in. All I can say is, If you take every possible thing that can happen, such as, for instance, the whole of the civil population, or a large part of it, rising in rebellion at the same time as an invasion takes place, you cannot provide for it. Moltke was once asked what provision he had made for three Powers attacking Germany instead of two. His reply was, "I have made none and Germany must take care of herself." And so the noble Duke and I will have to take care of ourselves without any assistance of an adequate description from the Government of the day if the civil population rises to an enormous extent in rebellion at the same time an an invading army lands upon these shores. Those are not contingencies against which it is possible for any Government to prepare.<lb/>
Then as regards the Territorial Force, the noble Duke said that if it may conceivably be used for the purpose of putting down civil not it ought to be told so, and he said it did not understand so at the present time. The public know quite clearly that the Territorial Force cannot be called out or embodied for the purpose of putting down riot, but when embodied the soldier, be he Territorial or Regular, is in the same position in this matter. The noble Duke and I would be called upon at once to act as special constables if the State required our services, and while I think he would probably be a great deal more efficient than I should be, I should none the less be under a legal obligation to lend what assistance I could, and so it is with the Territorial Force. You cannot embody them for the purpose under the law, but when they are embodied they have to help the State and can be used just as freely.<lb/>
I come to the other point. The noble Duke is haunted by the nightmare of the foreign water who might mobilise at Inverness. He has alluded to these waiters as dangerous persons. I think we can take care of the foreign water if the contingency arises. He then went on to the number of troops who would be left in this country
<col>564</col>
if the Expeditionary Force had all gone abroad. Well, the Expeditionary Force may have gone abroad. If it has gone abroad rashly in the face of very great peril, that will be the responsibility of those who sent it abroad. You cannot say beforehand whether or not you will send abroad the whole of your Expeditionary Force. You may send only four Divisions. It is impossible to forecast these things or to base hypotheses on a state of circumstances which may be infinitely different from those we contemplate. But, if the whole of the Expeditionary Force had been sent abroad, there would remain 410,000 men. "But," asks the noble Duke, "in what condition?" The Territorial Force, he admits, is organised; but he asks, What about the rest? And the noble Earl, Lord Portsmouth, put to me the question, Where is your mobilisation equipment for the other 150,000 men?<lb/>
I explained fully in debate last session what was the plan of the General Staff, the plan that had actually been worked out and arranged for as regards these men. The number of 150,000 is too high. About 100,000 is the number. They are the men who are in the 74 battalions, and these are the battalions which are allotted for the defence of places that require defence, particularly naval ports and other places which require garrisoning. They are distributed, according to a plan, all over the coast of Great Britain and Ireland, and their duties are duties of local defence. They are not designed to be put into brigades, nor do they require mobilisation and transport arrangements of the order that are appropriate to mobile troops. They are there for the purpose of port defence, and unless you had them there you would have to supply their places with some other force. They are not scantily trained men, as has been suggested. They are men not only of the Special Reserve, but of the Regular Reserve. There is a surplus of Regular Reservists on mobilisation which goes into this number, and if the noble Duke will refer to a Return which was given on February 26 last in response to a Question put in the other House he will find the details. There are nearly 91,000 Regulars who will remain at home after the Expeditionary Force has gone abroad; in addition there are 55,000 Special Reservists, and there are 2,174 of the Permanent Staff of the Territorial Force, and 259,264 of the rest. There are still 2,267 of the Militia
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0308"/>
<col>565</col>
Reserve Division, and that makes a total of 409,651. Of these Regular Reservists a considerable number are in the 74 battalions, which are brought up on mobilisation to the number of 1,100 or 1,200 apiece. They serve the purpose of training drafts. They are constantly taking in recruits and sending recruits out, and owing to their size and the way in which they are organised they are capable of fulfilling the double function of training troops and affording defence to those places which require this kind of defence. Of course, they have not got mobilisation equipment in the way of transport because they are not intended to be mobile, but they have all the other necessary equipment.<lb/>
As to the horses required for the Cavalry, the scheme of classification of horses has been to a very great extent carried into operation. It has covered already a great part of the country. We have classified a great many more than enough horses to provide for the Regulars, and in a short time we shall have classified more than enough to provide for the Territorials; and there will still be a large number over to provide for wastage and for extra requirements. I quite agree that, like any other army in the world, we require more horses in war than we have in peace, but under this plan we shall get not only what we want but more than we want. We take every step we can to make up the number of horses required by the Cavalry. Last September we purchased 650 horses and added them to the establishment of the Regular Cavalry, and in the Estimates this year 20 horses have been added to every Cavalry regiment at home. If the noble Earl will look further at what was said in the Statement on the Estimates he will see that we provide for the Cavalry horses being of a better type than they have hitherto been. Up to now our Army has suffered because the horses were too young for their work, and there was, accordingly, great wastage. Four new training depots are being established, one in Ireland and three in this country, to which horses as they are bought for the Cavalry will be sent, and when they have been thoroughly hardened and trained, then, and not till then, will they go to the regiment. Some of the seasoned horses of the regiments will probably be boarded out under a new system which we are arranging, but they can be got back at a few moments' notice; and while they are being boarded
<col>566</col>
out the younger horses will be becoming seasoned in the depots awl will be brought up to the mark. In that way we hope to have an adequate supply of horses for the Cavalry. As the noble Earl knows, there is a system now under which, for the purpose of encouraging horse-breeding, there is considerable expenditure on the part of the Board of Agriculture in stimulating horse-breeding, and our plan is to buy the horses young and send them to the four Cavalry training depots which I have described, and from there introduce them in a hardened condition into the Cavalry.<lb/>
As regards the Artillery, it is not so easy. There you have to rely to a great extent on what horses you can get. Until lately we had these admirable bus-horses, which were a valuable stand-by. I am afraid we cannot reckon on these admirable horses much longer, and we are taking such steps as we hope will enable us to provide substitutes for them so as to keep the Artillery in a satisfactory condition. You do not, of course, want such highly-trained horses for the Artillery as you do for the Cavalry, but you do want good strong horses. One of the most anxious problems which we have at the present time is to keep our hand on a sufficient supply of hardened horses for the Artillery Still, I hope that the steps we are taking will result in its being solved. I think I have now covered the question about the horses. I would only add this, that all the 410,000 men are organised men. They are all in either the 74 Special Reserve <i>cadres</i> or in other <i>cadres</i> or in the Territorial Force. Besides that, in an unorganised form, you get what you may realise from the National Reserve. That Reserve has already in the very short space of its life reached about 70,000. That list is being classified. There is very little doubt that it will increase strongly in the future, and in that list there is a very large number of capable men on whom in an emergency we might rely to come forward and render assistance of various kinds. Some of them are highly trained non-commissioned officers who could take commissions, if necessary, at a pinch in the Territorial Force and in the Special Reserve. Others are men who would be invaluable for the seasoning of 
the Territorial Force, taking the place of untrained recruits and mobilising the Territorial Force up to its strength. I therefore think that, considering that the
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0309"/>
<col>567</col>
410,000 men apart from that source numbers nearly six times the 70,000 which is the conceivable maximum against which you ought to provide, and having regard to the principles of naval strategy which were propounded the day before yesterday by my right hon. friend the First Lord of the Admiralty in his speech in the House of Commons, and to the fact that the Navy is our first, and, for that matter, our second line of defence, even when the whole of the Expeditionary Force had been sent abroad we are not left in such a condition as to give rise to fears or apprehensions of unknown terrors.</membercontribution></p>

<title>METROPOLITAN POLICE RATE BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01155" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01156">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01157"><sup>*</sup><member>THE PAYMASTER-GENERAL (LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have the honour to move the Second Reading of this Bill, the object of which is to extend the powers of the Secretary of State for imposing a rate for police purposes in London. This is not the first time that the Bill has appeared in this House. On the last occasion it failed to obtain a Second Reading at your Lordships' hands. Let me recall what happened. I moved the Second Reading on December 14 last year. The noble Viscount opposite, Lord Midleton, took objection to the Bill on the ground that the date at which it had been introduced had left no reasonable opportunity for discussion in another place or for the London County Council to consider its provisions. I explained to him that many of the facts which necessitated the Bill had only matured late in the year, and that there had been a change in the Home Secretaryship. But he took a more serious objection to the Bill on the ground that the powers which it sought to confer upon the Secretary of State with regard to rating were more than sufficient to meet the exigencies of the situation, and the noble Viscount secured the rejection of the Bill in a very thin House, the figures being twenty-two to fifteen. The Bill which I have the honour to introduce to-day is the same Bill as that which was introduced last session with one very important addition, which is contained in proviso (<i>b</i>) of Clause 1. This provision should go far to reconcile the opposition to the Bill and dispel any honest misgivings which may be entertained with regard to it.<lb/>
Let me first state briefly what the Bill does. The Bill raises the statutory maximum rate which the Secretary of State may impose for police purposes from ninepence, which was fixed by the Act of 1868, to elevenpenee. This is necessitated by actual and prospective deficiencies in the Police Fund. Those deficiencies have been caused, on the one hand, by the growth of expenditure, and, on the other, by the lack of corresponding expansion in the revenue. The main items which account for the growth of expenditure are the one day's rest in seven accorded to the police by general consent last year, the better remuneration to which they were generally
<col>572</col>
considered to be entitled, and the necessity of continually increasing the number of the police in its ratio to the population of London on account of the various and obvious problems with which the metropolitan police have to deal. And I might also mention that there is the general rise in the price of commodities, to which the police are subjected as much as anyone else. Alongside this growth of expenditure there has been a decline in the revenue, and the first reason for that is due to the decline of the rateable value of London, which, of course, affects the productivity of the rate. Ten years ago the rateable value of London increased by &#x00A3;2,000,000. At the next quinquennial period there was only an increase of &#x00A3;1,500,000, and last year there was a positive decrease in the rateable value to the extent of &#x00A3;350,000. Your Lordships will easily see the significance of that from this point of view. There is a further diminishing source of revenue caused by the failure of the Exchequer contributions. I do not mean to say that the Exchequer contributions paid out of the Local Taxation Account to the local authorities have actually diminished, but the percentage which those contributions bear to the general expenditure has diminished, with the result that all the services which they are intended to supplement have suffered, and the police rate has suffered with them.<lb/>
Perhaps your Lordships may feel, in regarding the items of this balance sheet, and especially in view of the diminished Exchequer contributions, that the ratepayers of London are entitled to special consideration at the hands of the Exchequer. I would point out to your Lordships in reference to this consideration that the London Police Fund already enjoys a grant of &#x00A3;100,000 a year from Imperial sources, which is supposed to cover the national and Imperial service which the police render in the metropolis, and I understand that that amply covers the services they render under that head. Further, the salaries of the metropolitan police magistrates, which amount to &#x00A3;40,000 a year, are defrayed out of the Consolidated Fund, and the Police Pension Fund enjoys a subsidy of &#x00A3;150,000 a year from Imperial sources; so that the Exchequer has already made very considerable contributions to the expenses of the London police. Further, if we consider the position of London in comparison with the position of counties and boroughs, we
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0312"/>
<col>573</col>
find that the contributions paid out of the Local Taxation Fund are larger in the case of London than they are in the counties and boroughs. In counties and boroughs the contributions amount to 39&#x02D9;5 per cent. of the total cost of the police; in London they amount to 44&#x02D9;7 per cent., so that I do not think there is much of a case to be made out in comparison with the position that obtains elsewhere.<lb/>
But I am quite prepared to admit that the police are a burden on the ratepayers. Your Lordships are aware that a Royal Commission reported recently, and I dare say you may also be aware that a Departmental Committee is at present sitting considering the Report of that Commission, and I have no doubt that when the Departmental Committee has concluded its labours a case may be made out for further contributions from Imperial sources to the rates under this head. I would point out to your Lordships that the Bill recognises to some extent that fact. In subsection (<i>a</i>) of Clause 1 there is a proviso which amounts to this, that whereas the contribution paid by local authorities bears, roughly speaking, the proportion of four-ninths of the total of the expense, no additional contribution is expected from them in respect of this additional rate which we are now asking leave to impose.<lb/>
Returning for a moment to the actual deficiencies which we have to meet, I will give your Lordships the figures with respect to the coming financial year and the two succeeding financial years. If we assume that there is no increase in the police force in order to meet the one day's rest in seven, there will be a deficiency in the financial year 1912&#x2013;13 of &#x00A3;82,500; in the year 1913&#x2013;14, of &#x00A3;75,900; and in the year 1914&#x2013;15, of &#x00A3;141,300. That represents the normal growth of expenditure, and is the net deficiency over re venue on the present rating maximum. But if the one clay's rest in seven is provided it must add to those figures a further &#x00A3;30,000 for 1912&#x2013;13, a further &#x00A3;51,000 for 1913&#x2013;14, and a further &#x00A3;54,000 for 1914&#x2013;15; and if a further 200 men a year are to be added for the normal growth of the population you must add a further &#x00A3;10,000 for the coming financial year, &#x00A3;27,000 for 1913&#x2013;14, and &#x00A3;40,000 for 1914&#x2013;15, so that the net deficiencies in the three years are &#x00A3;122,500, &#x00A3;153,900, and &#x00A3;241,300 respectively, on the assumption that the rest day is given and that the force is increased in a normal manner.<lb/>
<col>574</col>
But that is not all, because for seven years past the balances of the Police Fund have diminished, and it is estimated that if those balances are to be replaced in a satisfactory position to avoid the necessity of considerable loans to finance the force, a further sum of &#x00A3;108,000 is needed this year to restore the solvency of the fund, so that the total for this year is &#x00A3;230,000. A penny rate produces approximately &#x00A3;233,000, so that of the additional two- penny rate which I am asking your Lordships to sanction one penny is immediately absorbed in the current year. The justification for the second penny is the possibility of emergencies arising. I would point out that in cases of emergency caused by labour troubles it might be necessary to recall the pensioners of the police, and supposing 1,000 pensioners were recalled the cost would run into about &#x00A3;10,000 a month. It might also be necessary to engage additional men or to enroll special constables, and although for a short period the citizens of London might be expected to serve without pay, if the crisis were prolonged it might be necessary to engage some thousands of extra men, which might run us into an expenditure of &#x00A3;20,000 or &#x00A3;30,000 a month. So that it is conceivable that in the case of serious labour troubles the Police Fund might be called upon to meet something like an expenditure of &#x00A3;100,000. That is the justification for our coming to the House and asking leave to increase the maximum rate to elevenpence instead of to tenpence.<lb/>
To turn to, perhaps, the more controversial issues which this subject arouses, I think one might say the controversy has advanced since the subject was discussed in this House last cession. I do not think noble Lords who spoke on that occasion will revive all the arguments on which they relied then and which they employed to secure the rejection of the Bill. I do not think that the node Viscount, Lord Alidleton, will tell us now that only &#x00A3;50,000 is wanted, as he did last year. I hope I have made it quite clear that we need at least &#x00A3;122,000 to carry on the coming year. And then the noble Earl, Lord Dunmore, told us that the ninepenny rate at present in force produced a surplus of &#x00A3;150,000. When he said that I think he entirely overlooked the deficiency in the Police Pension Fund, which accounted for &#x00A3;282,000 last year. We have no surplus. The balances have been increasingly depleted. In 1905 the balances stood at
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0313"/>
<col>575</col>
&#x00A3;541,000, and they have been reduced, as I have explained, to &#x00A3;367,000, and this year we need &#x00A3;108,000 to restore the balances to something like a reasonable figure. Then the noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, told us last year that if the Bill were thrown out, as it was, not a single policeman would go short of a farthing and not a single administrative act would be changed. I told the noble Viscount then that if he secured the rejection of the Bill all recruiting to give effect to the one day's rest in seven would have to be stopped, and it has been stopped.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01158"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My point was that it was not necessary to stop it. On the contrary, it has been proved that there was no necessity whatever to stop the recruiting for the one day's rest in seven.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01159"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: I thought I had made it clear that if the one day's rest in seven is to be provided an additional deficiency will be incurred of &#x00A3;30,000 next year. Anyhow, I hope I made it quite clear that it was impossible to go on recruiting to give effect to the one day's rest in seven, and recruiting has since last December been at a standstill. I do not complain of all the arguments which the noble Viscount used, because to some extent I sympathise with him. He had very little time for considering the Bill, and no doubt some of his figures were rather hastily obtained. I suggest to-day that the controversy between us is narrowed, and it is narrowed to this, not whether the eleventh penny should be authorised, but subject to what restrictions and to what guarantees that authority should be given. And here we come to the important subsection to which I previously alluded. It runs thus&#x2014;
<quote>"(<i>b</i>) before approving the issue of any warrants under section twenty-three of the Metropolitan Police Act, 1829, be the effect of which the annual sum to he provided for the purposes of the Metropolitan Police in any year will be for the first time increased above the rate of tenpence in the pound, the Secretary of State shall lay before the House of Commons a Minute stating the reasons for such increase; and if within the next twenty days on which the House has sat after any such Minute has been laid before it, an Address is presented to His Majesty by the House praying that the said increase be not made, the said increase shall not then be made."</quote>
I am aware that that is not what the noble Viscount asked for. What he asked for was that this second penny should not be levied unless a substantive Motion were introduced
<col>576</col>
and carried. But although there is a difference I suggest to him that the difference is not so very great, especially in view of the fact that he was then content, and I suppose is still content, to leave the duty of safeguarding the interests of the ratepayers to the House of Commons. I will read what the noble Viscount said last year about that. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"In several measures which have passed the House of Commons it was required that the Act should not be put into operation until a substantive Motion had been moved and carried in both Houses. I do not here say both Houses of Parliament, but I do ask that if the Secretary of State, who cannot possibly for some years to come require more than a penny rate, desires to raise the other, he should give a pledge that a substantive Motion shall be moved in the House of Commons and carried before any portion of that further penny rate is applied to the services of the police."</quote>
As I say the difference between the noble Viscount's substantive Motion and what is placed in the Bill is not very considerable. It really whittles down to this, whether the discussion on this subject in the House of Commons should take place before eleven o'clock or after eleven o'clock, and I submit to you, if there is sufficient interest&#x2014;I dare say there will be&#x2014;on this subject in another place, that after eleven o'clock will afford ample opportunity for any individuals interested in the matter making an effective protest if they desire to do so.<lb/>
In this matter we are, of course, very much in the hands of noble Lords opposite. But I appeal to the noble Viscount&#x2014;and I would have appealed to the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition if he had been in his place&#x2014;whether it is judicious for this House to appear to dictate to another place what is, after all, largely a matter of domestic concern to them, because it is very little more than a matter of machinery whether the opportunity for discussing this subject should take the form of a substantive Motion put down by the Secretary of State or whether it should be left to any individual member of the House of Commons to raise the question in the manner which is provided. The noble Viscount has, I think, good reason to be satisfied with what he has achieved. If he has not got all, he has got nearly all he asked for. He has occasioned delay, he has occasioned ample consideration of this subject in another place&#x2014;two debates took place, as he well knows&#x2014;he has accomplished a revision of the Bill, he has secured important concessions; and I put it to him, seeing that when he was in the position of Secretary of
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0314"/>
<col>577</col>
State he asked for and obtained at the hands of the House of Commons and at your Lordships' hands wide and ample discretionary powers far larger than any we are considering to-day, whether it is not a little unbecoming of him to cavil when the Secretary of State comes down to your Lordships' House and asks you to give him certain discretionary powers, subject to the safeguards which are now in the Bill, in order that he may use them, if he thinks fit, in the public interest.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01160">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Ashby St. Ledgers</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01161"><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord who has just spoken prefaced his remarks by drawing attention to the alteration which has now taken place in this Bill, and he expressed a hope that we would now regard it with more satisfaction. Speaking for myself, I cannot say that I do regard it altogether with satisfaction. I think that any increase over the penny should only take place by Resolution of the House of Commons. But I will express my satisfaction at the figures which the noble Lord has given to the House this evening. Those figures show that it would require to meet the extra expenditure on the police force an additional sum of approximately &#x00A3;230,000. Your Lordships will recollect that when this Bill came up to us last December we refused to pass a measure which took power to impose, not a penny rate, but a twopenny rate&#x2014;an extra burden of nearly &#x00A3;500,000 on the ratepayers of London&#x2014;without the local authorities representing those ratepayers having had any opportunity of putting forward their views. Now the figures which the noble Lord has just given us provide, even taking the same basis for calculation as the noble Lord has done, ample and a complete vindication of your Lordships' action. That action was taken on a Motion by the noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, that if it was found desirable to raise anything further than an extra penny rate a substantive Motion should be moved and carried in the House of Commons before any portion of the further penny rate was applied to the services of the police.<lb/>
It is quite clear that a penny rate will be sufficient to meet the deficiencies in the Police Fund for the next three years. I will take the figures which the noble Lord has
<col>578</col>
himself given us this evening. He says there is a deficiency over revenue of &#x00A3;82,000. He then went on to say that it would require another &#x00A3;30,000 to provide one day's rest in seven under the Act of 1910, and then he asked for an additional &#x00A3;10,000 to cover the cost of recruiting a further 200 men. That leaves a net balance of &#x00A3;108,000 if a penny rate were imposed&#x2014;a net balance which he suggests should be utilised for restoring the depletion in the working balance of the Police Fund. But I ask the noble Lord, Why does he propose to restore the working balance at one fell swoop? Would it not be more reasonable&#x2014;it is not a recurring charge&#x2014;and more in accordance with business methods, certainly under the circumstances, to spread this payment over two or even over three years if that were done, it would not be necessary to impose even an additional penny rate&#x2014;a &#x00BE;d. rate would be quite sufficient for the year 1912&#x2013;13, and the whole of the penny rate could be imposed in the following year, and the twopenny rate might be relegated to future years for our grandsons or granddaughters whoever controlled the Treasury in those days.<lb/>
One fact, however, stands out quite clear. It is that, however you deal with these figures, on whatever basis you make your calculations, the produce of a penny rate is amply sufficient to cover the whole of the required expenditure at the present time and for the next few years. I ask your Lordships why, under those circumstances, did the Home Secretary try to make Party capital out of the rejection of this Bill last year? What was the foundation for the Home Secretary's statement in the public Press that we were responsible for preventing the metropolitan police from securing the benefits of the one day's rest in seven? This House was perfectly willing to accept a measure giving immediate power to impose an additional penny rate, but the Government were unwilling to restrict their measure in such a way as to give some security that Parliament should have an opportunity of discussing the matter before any further expenditure over and above that extra penny was imposed. What do we now find? The Home Secretary again produces this Bill taking power to impose an additional twopenny rate, against which even Members on his own side voted. When this Bill came to be discussed in Committee criticisms were freely offered from both sides of the
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0315"/>
<col>579</col>
House, and the Bill, which was passed in the previous December without any discussion, owing to the circumstances under which it was smuggled through the House, found no friends when it was brought forward in a more constitutional manner. Mr. McKenna himself, with refreshing candour, made the following remark&#x2014;
<quote>"After listening to the whole of the debate the one fact obvious is that nobody likes this Bill."</quote>
The Bill which the Home Secretary discovered on February 29 last was a Bill which nobody in the House of Commons liked was the same Bill to which he referred in his letter to <i>The Times</i> on December 21 last as having passed through the House of Commons by agreement. I really think that the position must have been a somewhat trying one, even for a gentleman of his great ability, to talk of a Bill having passed through the House of Commons by agreement, and then, when he conies to reintroduce it, to find that it meets with such vehement opposition that he is forced to bring forward a very important Amendment which has since been embodied in the Bill. This Bill is not the same Bill that we discussed last year, and in view of the alteration in it I might well ask the noble Lord opposite a question which I am afraid he cannot possibly answer, and that is, What about the agreed Bill out of which Mr. McKenna made so much Party capital? The agreed Bill was objected to by both sides of the House of Commons and has disappeared. The noble Lord asked whether it was advisable for us to dictate to the other House. My Lords, where was the dictation to the other House when the other House had no opportunity of discussing this Bill?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01162"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: I was alluding to the present occasion, not to the past.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01163"><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member><membercontribution>: We have not, as far as I know, this evening dictated to the other House. In my opinion we have clone what we wanted to do. We have given the other House that opportunity of discussing the matter which it was our duty to do. Substantially it comes to this, that the House of Commons, when afforded a reasonable opportunity of discussing and considering the matter, has taken the same view of the proposals of His Majesty's Government as was taken by your Lordships last December.</membercontribution></p>
<col>580</col>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01164"><member>LORD MONK BRETTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think we can all agree with the noble Earl who has just sat down that an extra penny rate is sufficient for the needs of the police at any rate for the next three years. I gather from the remarks of the noble Lord who introduced this Bill, and also from the remarks which were made in another place by the Home Secretary, that the only two circumstances which led to the asking for the second penny were, in the first place, the possible progressive decline in the Exchequer Contribution Account; and, secondly, the fear of labour tumults. I noticed that this evening the noble Lord laid very little stress on the former&#x2014;on the possible progressive decline in the Exchequer Contribution Account. I venture to say there is a balance at the present moment and that it will be time enough to legislate for a possible progressive decline in that account when it arises, more especially as last year was a year of abnormal expenditure connected with the King's Coronation.<lb/>
But the second contingency on which the noble Lord laid stress was the possibility of labour troubles. Far be it from me to say that that is not a very important matter at the present time, but what I would submit to your Lordships is that labour troubles are matters of great emergency and require emergency methods to meet them. It is the practice of the Home Secretary every year to borrow money for the purposes of the police. That has been explained by Mr. McKenna in another place, and it was alluded to this evening by the noble Lord, and if a great emergency occurs, surely that is a very proper case for an emergency loan and not a reason to impose taxation to the amount of &#x00A3;250,000 permanently upon the ratepayers of London. Those ratepayers, in spite of what the noble Lord has said, have had somewhat hard treatment in regard to payments to the police. Originally, and for a great number of years, the proportion was 4<i>d.</i> from the Exchequer and 5<i>d.</i> from the ratepayers Then, under the policy of the Act of 1888 and the assigned revenues from which the Exchequer Contribution Account was drawn, an alteration began to set in, and in the year 1907 the ratepayers paid a fraction over 51 per cent. as against the Exchequer's contribution of a little over 48 per cent In 1910 the ratepayers paid 55&#x02D9;3 against the Exchequer's 44&#x02D9;7 per cent. That was quoted by the noble Lord. What he did not
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0316"/>
<col>581</col>
quote was that in the Estimates for this year the amount from the Exchequer Contribution Account is only 41&#x02D9;7 against the ratepayers' 58&#x02D9;3. Consequently the ratepayer is being increasingly burdened, and that in spite of the fact that the Royal Commission to which the noble Lord, referred recommended, that the contribution should be as 50 and 50, or half-and-half, and therefore I do say there is a very sound case to be made out for the consideration of the ratepayers of London in connection with this matter.<lb/>
I do not think that your Lordships' House has any idea of objecting to the Second Reading of this Bill. Your Lordships never did object to the first penny. You recognised its necessity and endeavoured to meet the difficulty last December. But, as the noble Lord has pointed out, this Bill comes back to us with a very important change in it, and that change&#x2014;I will call it Mr. McKenna's clause&#x2014;the noble Lord read to the House. I do think that it is not fair, having regard to the press of business in another place and to the procedure there, to say that this second penny may be imposed without a Vote of the House of Commons. I think that it ought to be imposed by a Vote of the House of Commons. That would be a proper way to vote this very large increase. When you come to the Committee stage your Lordships will find that in any case you will have to amend this clause, because if you look at it you will see that it runs&#x2014;
<quote>"And if, within the next twenty days on which the House has sat alter fly such Minute has been laid before it, an Address is presented to His Majesty by the House, praying that the said increase be not made, the said increase shall not then be made."</quote>
What does "then" mean? Does it mean this year or next year? Does it mean that the House of Commons may pass an Address that the increase should not be voted, but that the increase, though not then made, may be made the following year? The drafting of this clause, particularly in regard to the use of the word " then," is so ambiguous that in any case it will be necessary to amend it in Committee.<lb/>
But that is not the whole ground of my objection to this clause as it stands. This clause contains the most unprecedented procedure. It has been the habit in many recent Bills to say that such and such Regulations or such and such Papers
<col>582</col>
should be laid on the Table of both Houses of Parliament and that certain things should only take place concurrently with them. That was the procedure in the National Insurance Act of last year, in the Finance Act of 1909&#x2013;10, in the Trade Boards Act, 1909, and in the Labour Exchanges and Town Planning Acts. In all of those measures it was required that certain Papers should be laid on the Table of both Houses of Parliament. I can find no precedent for the language in this clause, that the Minute shall be laid on the Table of the House of Commons only, But I believe I did discover where it might have arisen, because I looked in the Speaker's Manual as to the procedure of the House of Commons, and I found that this language has to be used in cases where Bills have been rejected three times under the Parliament Act, and are required to go to Royal Assent without the consent of your Lordships' House, or in the case of Finance Bills under the Parliament Act. But, so far as I am aware, this clause introduces new language which I believe is without precedent, at any rate in recent times, and therefore I submit that this is a matter for the grave consideration of your Lordships' House when this Bill goes into Committee.<lb/>
I hope that your Lordships will not give the Home Secretary a blank cheque as to this second penny. I do not want to say extravagant things, but, after all, it was the Home Secretary who recently set the example of sending the metropolitan police to Wales. This year they may go to Ireland for all I know. That is not a matter which I wish to criticise. It may be necessary in the public interest. But what I do say is that if the metropolitan police are going to be used by the Home Secretary in this way, it is more than ever necessary to safeguard the interests of the London ratepayers, and that if they pay for a man to watch them they at least should have the benefit of his protection.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01165"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, do not wish to reiterate any of the arguments which have been ably put by my noble friend with regard to the financial question raised by this Bill, but there are two points on which I should like to ask for explanations before we give the Bill a Second Reading. I think that we have grave reason to complain of the language used by the Home Secretary and the
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0317"/>
<col>583</col>
statements made after the rejection of this Bill on December 14 last year. Lord Ashby St. Ledgers has said to-night that he told us then that if the Bill was rejected the recruiting to supply the one day's rest in seven for the police must necessarily be stopped. He did tell us that, and it was repeated by the Home Secretary, but the statement had not a shadow of foundation. I say with great respect that recruiting was stopped as an electioneering appeal to the metropolitan police to prejudice them against your Lordships' House and against those who had stood in the way. The whole cost of the additional men to be raised for the metropolitan police for this particular service amounted to &#x00A3;51,000 a year, and the delay in regard to money caused by your Lordships rejection of this Bill three months ago would have accounted for something between &#x00A3;15,000 and &#x00A3;20,000 at the outside, and that in an expenditure which already amounts, from the ratepayers alone, to &#x00A3;1,500,000 a year. This fact makes it almost ludicrous to suppose that there was any foundation for the proposition put forward.<lb/>
I am afraid I must go a step further. We; have never been treated fairly and frankly in this matter. Everybody knows &#x2014;the figures have shown it most conclusively and it was proved in the House of Commons&#x2014;that these additions which are to be made to the police are to be made on three grounds&#x2014;first, the rest day, the charge in respect of which I have already mentioned to your Lordships; secondly, the normal increase of the police due to the increase of population; and, thirdly, in order to have a larger reserve of men available for possible emergencies, which have nothing whatever to do with the rest day. Those emergencies had an extremely apt illustration last year, when for three or four months the metropolitan police sent a large body of men to Tonypandy. But there has never been a proposal to reimburse the ratepayers for their share in the cost. It is quite true that the Government are going to pay for the actual period during which those men were away, but everybody knows that if you are to be ready to send 1,000 men at any moment for two months or three months away from the force, you are putting upon the ratepayers the expense for the other nine or ten months of keeping these men so that they may be available, and that was the main object for the
<col>584</col>
increase. The numbers required for the weekly rest day in addition to those raised before did not justify the Home Secretary in the remarks he made and in the attempt he made in the public Press to declare that by your Lordships' action his hands had been tied in the policy with regard to one day's rest in seven, on which we were all agreed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01166"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: I said that national services such as those to which the noble Viscount alluded are more than covered by the grant of &#x00A3;100,000 per annum from the Exchequer.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01167"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: It is a pity that the noble Lord has not given us the exact figures as to the number of men, which would have assisted us in forming a judgment as to the truth of the Home Secretary's statement. We have the figures at the London County Council, and we know the facts. The public, if they had them before them, would see at once that what I have stated to your Lordships is absolutely correct.<lb/>
I am only concerned with two or three points this afternoon. The first is to point out that your Lordships were amply justified in the course which was taken three months ago. We asserted then that an extra penny would be sufficient., and it has now been proved in the House of Commons that an extra penny rate will be sufficient for the next three years. We contended that the Bill had been hastily considered, and that no opportunity had been given for the expression of adverse opinion. That has been proved; because not one single London Member in the House of Commons rose to support the Bill during the two evenings on which it was under discussion. Every London Member, so far as we know, opposed the Bill, but after an appeal had been made by the Home Secretary to their patriotism to Party a number of those who had spoken against the Bill finally voted with the Government. We asserted also that it was absolutely necessary that there should be some safeguard before the second penny was raised. That safeguard has been put in, but not in a form for which there is any precedent or which can be well defended. It is quite true that I suggested that a substantive Motion should be made. Unquestionably it is one thing to say that for a particular object the

Government shall propose a substantive Motion in one House, and it is quite another to say, when you insert a provision that objection can be taken, that this House shall be placed in a different position from that which it has always occupied.<lb/>
I say it was a most serious charge which was made against us that this House was alone in standing against the Bill. It has now been proved that this House had the support of all those who represent the ratepayers of London. What we succeeded in doing was to stop the Government from smuggling this Bill through without proper discussion. I confess that I feel it very strongly, when those who represent the ratepayers are struggling to keep down the rates of London, to find so large a sum placed upon the ratepayers which has always before been divided between Imperial funds and the rates. We have a most valuable admission in addition to the other points from the noble Lord this afternoon, because he told us that it might certainly be considered that a case had been made out for further contributions from the State, and if we obtain that alone, of which we take note, we have obtained something which the ratepayers would have lacked but for the action taken by your Lordships' House in December last.</membercontribution></p>

I understand that the noble Viscount is more or less satisfied with the safeguards at present provided in the Bill, but he feels that if there is not to be the substantive Motion for which he asks the Minute should be laid on the Table of both Houses. [VISCOUNT MIDLETON nodded assent.] I understand that if it is by a substantive Motion the noble Viscount would not expect it to be moved and carried in both Houses, but if the safeguard is to take the form in the Bill then he thinks the Minute ought to be laid on the Table of both Houses. If that is his point and if that is really all there is between us, and if, subject to that, the Bill can go through in its present form, I think I can undertake that the Secretary of State will be prepared to accept that alteration in the subsection.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE CONGO.</title>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01172"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF WINCHESTER</member> rose to call attention to the affairs of the Congo. The right rev. Prelate said: My Lords, I do not think that even at this time, when our minds are preoccupied with matters so grave, I need make any apology to your Lordships for asking a few minutes' attention to the subject which I have put on the Paper. Whatever the gravity of the relations between classes here, anyone, I think, who has considered the future must feel that the relations between nations and races are at least as grave. I think it would further be admitted that the matter of the Congo State has been for some years past the premier case of anxiety and even of danger, moral and political, in regard to the relations between the white races and the coloured. I cannot express that better than in the words of the Foreign Secretary, who said that "no external question for at least thirty years has moved this country so strongly and vehemently."</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01173">There was a great force of public opinion, which came not only from quarters where opinion upon these subjects may be thought to be a little too lively and excitable, but which expressed itself through a great meeting in each large centre of population and industry presided over in case after case by the chief magistrate of the city. That opinion found voice also in the men whom we are accustomed to look to most for official interpretation, or something like official interpretation, of the opinion of the country. The noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, the present Foreign Secretary, the noble Earl who now sits upon
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0319"/>
<col>587</col>
the Front Bench (Lord Cromer) expressed themselves in language which I should think had had few parallels in comment upon the conduct of another State concerning the breach of faith, as it was considered, between the promises made when the Congo Free State was started and the actual performances. The cynicism with which methods of unexampled cruelty were carried out justified that strength of feeling in the country and that strength of expression on the part of responsible men who are accustomed to weigh their words. That strength of feeling was due, I think, to two causes&#x2014;first, the character of the <i>r&#x00E9;gime</i> which then prevailed in the Congo; and, secondly, the fact that the conscience and best opinions of this country felt that quite unmistakably we had a responsibility in the Congo. I need hardly justify that statement. It has been made by statesman after statesman, but I may just quote the expression, for instance, used by the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, who said&#x2014;
<quote>"I cannot admit that there is any doubt as to our right."</quote>
I shall refer to that again in another connection. I think we shall all feel that when there has been a great agitation of that kind, an agitation thoroughly justifiable and thoroughly representative of the best feeling and conscience of the country, it is a serious and anxious matter to watch what the issue of it is&#x2014;whether it proves ineffective altogether, whether it dies down leaving public opinion disappointed and wearied, and is succeeded by a period of lassitude and want of interest in the matter. And I feel that if in this House, after some time has passed and when we are at a critical point, perhaps one of the last critical points in the history, we showed no interest in the matter, we should be lacking rather in our duty.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01174">What was the result of that agitation? I am bound to say that I am doubtful whether it would have achieved anything had it not been for the death of the principal actor in these transactions. I do not know whether those who represent us diplomatically were or were not to blame, hut it seems to me extremely doubtful whether, but for that death, anything would have followed. It is true that the Congo Free State had been a few months before the death of King Leopold II transferred to Belgium, but it had been transferred in a way which showed no concern whatever for
<col>588</col>
the representations made on behalf of this country and under conditions which gave no guarantee for any improvement. But the whole scene changed with the death of King Leopold, and this country entered upon the new stage with, I think, a great feeling of hope. Belgium has always been a country with which we have had close relations. We have the feelings which connect together two races that have stood for freedom and whose interests of industry and so on are largely the same. Therefore I think England expected from that change a great deal. We hoped for the influence of a Parliamentary <i>r&#x00E9;gime</i> and we hoped for the influence of a young new Monarch who was known, both in Europe and, as the Papers show, in the Congo, to take so much interest in the matter that it might be well expected that a great deal would follow. And so, as regards public opinion here, I should describe what happened by saying that public opinion became passive in the matter, though I do not think it lost its interest, and I believe that in many quarters of society you would find that people were rather anxiously watching to see what next would follow.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01175">If I may say so, I do not think any very great pains were taken to satisfy legitimate anticipations in that way. I believe I am right in saying that the most rev. Primate some time ago expressed in this House the opinion that it would be very desirable if we could be more rapidly supplied with such Papers as the Government might have in their possession. All through this Congo business there has been some strange reluctance&#x2014;perhaps those who understand foreign affairs better than I do can explain it&#x2014;to bring out Papers which were perfectly fit for publication and which were finally published, but which were not brought out without delay. I only say that in passing. But we now have a considerable body of opinion in the White Paper, Africa No. 2 (1911). What does that show? In the first place, it gives the fullest justification to the agitation in England; it justifies fully what was felt and said about the system which had prevailed; it shows that the movement of moral opinion&#x2014;I claim no monopoly, I am thankful to say, for that to England, for there were forces in other countries, notably in Germany and in some degree in France, which were taking the same side&#x2014;it shows that all that movement of opinion has had a great deal of result.</p>
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0320"/>
<col>589</col>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01176">At one definite result it has had every lover of humanity must rejoice. It seems pretty plain that throughout the Congo district, perhaps throughout the whole area, outrages as we understand that word have disappeared. There are no longer the horrible mutilations, the cutting off of hands, the treatment of women and the rest. These, things have passed away with the malign influence by which they were sheltered. I think that that would in itself be an enormous relief to public opinion. But, of course, it might possibly be a relief out of proportion to the real value, because outrages appeal to our sentiments, and a system out of which the outrages have proceeded may really threaten harm which is not so much noticed, which is not, if I may say so, so sensational, but against which there is almost as much reason to protest. All through in this agitation the principles of which the outrages were the outcome had been kept quite steadily in view. It has never been a question of merely saying that such and such a case of intolerable cruelty on a large scale, amounting to the decimation of the population and so on&#x2014;it has never been said that those, and those alone, are the acts against which we protest. On the contrary, it has been said over and over again that these follow as a matter of course from a system which does not treat the native as a free man, which does not allow him any property in the land which is his own, which denies him, therefore, the opportunity of trading and of true progress, and which, in fact, exploits a great country for the sole benefit of a foreign race of a different colour.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01177">I think we may say, not only that the outrages have disappeared, but that there is evidence that the present Government of Belgium has done a great deal to alter the whole manner of treatment of the country. We are fold in this White Paper that there are signs that '"the former r&#x00E9;gime is undergoing radical change," and there are other parts of the White Book which amply confirm that. Perhaps I may mention one point which in some ways is the surest of indications. We know what enormous sums have been wrung out of the Congo under the Leopoldian system. We all wondered when Belgium took over the Congo what it would do in that respect; whether it would keep on wringing money out, or whether it would agree to be a loser. The Budget statistics given in the White
<col>590</col>
Paper show that receiving on the part of Belgium is more or less at an end, and that some degree of spending is taking its place. I should like just to say at this point that the evidence of improvement comes, not only from our Consuls, to whom we all feel we owe so great a debt in the whole history of this matter for informing and enlightening opinion in a very intrepid way but also from the missionaries. Perhaps I have a professional prejudice in favour of missionaries, but I do think that it is often suspected by public opinion generally that a missionary is a man who is always ready to complain and perhaps by so doing to make himself a nuisance. I think in the matter of the Congo we can hardly exaggerate what we owe to the missionaries&#x2014;not connected with my own Church at all&#x2014;who were greatly responsible for bringing to light the horrors of what happened. But I want now to point out that the same class of men speak with complete frankness about the improvement that has taken place, and seem to enjoy speaking well of their rulers at least as much as they can be supposed by some to have enjoyed speaking evil of them.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01178">Perhaps your Lordships think that at that point I might leave the matter. Opinion has worked an enormous improvement. The Belgian Government has lent itself to the influence of that opinion, which, let it be remembered, some of the men who now compose the Belgian Government scoffed at and denounced as futile and mistaken. Therefore it may be said that we can leave the future to take care of itself. But, my Lords, I should like to give one or two reasons why I think the policy of leaving the future to take care of itself would be an entirely mistaken one. First of all, we have to take account of the fact that all through one of the reasons which seem to us and to our Government to justify protest and action has been steadily denied on the part of those who were responsible for the Belgian Government, and denied in terms which I think no Government of a first-class Power could have allowed without challenge on the part of another first-class Power&#x2014;terms which certainly showed no superfluous courtesy or consideration, to say the least. The Belgian Government has always, before the death of King Leopold II and since, thrown back in the face of our Foreign Office any claim, which here everybody believes to be just on the part
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0321"/>
<col>591</col>
of Great Britain, to interfere in the matter at all on the ground of Treaty right and of the particular way in which the Congo State was set up. I think we might have hoped from the sister country of Belgium, when they came to recognise by their action that in the main the agitation here had been thoroughly justified and when in the main what was asked for had been done, that some frankness and acknowledgment, some courtesy, might have been given to us in return for the almost invincible courtesy with which the Foreign Secretary of this country had treated the Belgian Government. That, perhaps, is not a matter of any great importance&#x2014;words are not deeds. But I think we cannot read the evidence before us and say that all cruelty&#x2014;cruelty, I mean, even such as is condemned by the rather low standard which I am afraid prevails in many places between European and native races&#x2014;that all such cruelty has disappeared. We find still that the "chicotte," the hippopotamus whip, is in use. We find that there is a supply of arms going on to chiefs, some of them not the legitimate chiefs of the people but soldiers who have been put into chiefs' places and who keep troops of a low native type&#x2014;always one of the worst incidents in the whole matter&#x2014;and who by such measures as can be supposed accumulate wives to themselves.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01179">But let that pass. Let us come to the very heart of the matter. The representatives of our Government insisted again and again that the system was wrong right through, and must disappear. It is against all fair international dealing with the subject race to confiscate the land; it is against the elementary rights of the native, to destroy his power to trade and to force him to labour, not for his own benefit, but for the benefit of the governing Power. What has been the case, then, about the system? Has it been root and branch abolished? We all know what happened. The Belgian Government determined to deal with the system by instalments. In 1910 there was to be the abolition of forced labour and there was to be free trade throughout one section of the country, and so it happened. In 1911 there was to be the same through another section, and so again it happened; and in July of the present year the same thing is to extend to the last section of the Congo State, and so I believe it certainly will happen.
<col>592</col>
Criticisms have been made upon that method of dealing with the matter, and when we realise how evil the thing has been some impatience at seeing it abolished in that piecemeal way is not unnatural. But I do not think we should make too much of that. We know how difficult it is to change in these matters and how much is involved. But I think we are bound to notice that the land into which the new system was first brought was just the land which had been most exhausted. Therefore the land in which the old system still lasts, with many of its attendant evils, is the best field for exploitation. Let me quote from the White Paper to justify that&#x2014;
<quote>"The 1910 area, except for a few oases, is practically exhausted."</quote>
With regard to the other area, we read&#x2014;
<quote>"Forest rubber is fast disappearing, and by the time the Government surrenders the monopoly on this produce there will be none left."</quote>
And meanwhile&#x2014;this is what seems to me the ugliest feature of the case&#x2014;in the last area&#x2014;that is, the 1912 area&#x2014;where the pressure of the tyrannical system could still produce large results in rubber the system has been pressed with ruthless severity. That statement is made by Vice-Consul Armstrong with reference to the Uele district. The Vice-Consul says that the system could not be abolished at one blow, but I think any one who reads his description would say that that was a very mild way of expressing the truth. The old system is going to be pushed; on up to the hilt until the day in July this year is reached&#x2014;I mean exacting from the native labour at the rate of three days in every four, or twenty-five days in the month, pursuing the native into the forest and forcing him to labour. We read that&#x2014;
<quote>"Every effort was made to obtain as much rubber as possible with a total disregard of the means employed by the chiefs to enforce it."</quote>
The Vice-Consul also uses these words&#x2014;
<quote>"A direct system of slavery has been created and is maintained by the Government."</quote>
Now, my Lords, I think that is not only an important point in itself, but that it has further importance in raising in our minds a certain amount of distrust about Belgian action even under the altered and better system. There is another point upon which I think some real stress should be laid&#x2014;namely, that the Government of Belgium, in abolishing this abominable and unjust system and in setting up those improved conditions to which I have tried
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0322"/>
<col>593</col>
to do full justice, reserves to itself, and is known to reserve to itself, a power of revoking these concessions and falling back upon the older methods. I should like here, if I may, to state the words of one who I think is universally respected in this matter, and if his countrymen had listened a little more attentively to him we should have got, I think, earlier to better results&#x2014;I mean M. Vandervelde. These are his words&#x2014;
<quote>"The State reserves to itself the right to limit, to suppress, or to alienate the areas in which the light of the natives to gather produce is exercised, and to maintain or to extend the concessions system."</quote>
I understand the concessions system to mean putting the whole territory into the hands of a company and letting them do to a large extent what they like. He adds&#x2014;
<quote>"All the territories, or nearly all, whose exploitations have proved remunerative have been reserved for exploitation."</quote>
I ask you to consider what the effect of this power of revocation is upon the native, and I also ask your Lordships to consider&#x2014;what others are far better able to discuss than myself&#x2014;the effect it must have on trade, because if security be the first condition, as I suppose it to be, of the development of trade, then the absence of a guarantee for the future would certainly be against that development of trade, which almost more than anything we desire to see in the Congo area. This is no imaginary risk: more than one of our Consuls appear to report that a return to the old system is regarded as a very real possibility.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01180">There are other points connected with that which combine to cause us suspicion. There is the maintenance of a standing force of low-paid black soldiers; there is the fact that many of those who are working the new <i>r&#x00E9;gime</i> in Belgium and probably in the Congo are people who worked&#x2014;shall I say contentedly&#x2014;in connection with the old <i>r&#x00E9;gime,</i> and there are certain other sinister things because they are so capable of further development&#x2014;I mean requisitions of labour for works of public utility and for revenue purposes and works for Government profit. When we find those things still going on, when we find also that upon a tremendously exhausted country taxation is still exceptionally heavy, when we find that the Government itself is entering into competition with traders, I think there are elements of danger in all that which cannot be regarded with other than very grave consideration.</p>
<col>594</col>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01181">What, then, is the duty of England in those, circumstances? I would submit that the duty of England is not to relax such hold as she already has, which is not a very great hold. What is it? It is, as your Lordships probably all know, that hitherto this country has not recognised&#x2014;to use the technical phrase&#x2014;the annexation of the Congo by Belgium. In answer to this the Belgian authorities have steadily "bluffed" all claims on our part to interfere. It has been said on our side that in requiring improvements we were only claiming our Treaty rights and discharging our Treaty obligations. So the Foreign Secretary said; and it has been said by the noble Marquess opposite that he could not admit that there was any doubt of our right to interfere. And with that right in his hand, the Foreign Secretary, in a memorable declaration, said&#x2014;
<quote>"It must be a condition precedent to any transfer of the Congo to another authority that that authority should take it over on terms&#x2014;"</quote>
Here I think the statement becomes a little indefinite&#x2014;
<quote>"which would place it in a position to give assurances and to guarantee that those assurances shall be carried out and the Treaty obligations of the Congo fulfilled."</quote>
We all know how that was understood here. It was understood to mean that whatever power, diplomatic at least, England possessed would be employed to prevent annexation unless guarantees were given; we know that it was so complained of by Belgium; and we know that the interpretation was true, because when the guarantees were not given the British Government, though it entirely failed to back up its strong words with strong deeds, did not recognise annexation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01182">Recognition is the one remaining weapon or lever in our hands. The reports of the Consuls show it to be assumed in the country that if once England recognises the annexation there is an end to all interference with the internal affairs whether by England or by any other country. It has then passed out of the condition of international guarantee into a position of international independence. Therefore if I ha\e put the case rightly before your Lordships it will mean that Great Britain acquiesces in a system which, except for outrages, still retains, either in execution or in reserve, the principles of the system against which the protests were made. I should like to express
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0323"/>
<col>595</col>
what I desire to say in the words of one of our Consuls&#x2014;
<quote>"The Belgian Government has yet to make good its claim that the native will be justly and humanely treated, and that forced labour will not be permitted."</quote>
I venture to claim your attention for one moment more because I cannot end without referring to what does appear to me to be a very regrettable utterance on the part of one of our representatives. On Page 52 of the White Paper we have an account from Sir Arthur Hardinge, our representative in Brussels, of an interview between himself and the Belgian Minister. In his Despatch to Sir Edward Grey he alludes to the fact that in 1912 the whole area will be free, and then he says&#x2014;
<quote>"and it will probably then be possible for you consistently with the attitude "which you have throughout maintained, to recognise, or at least to seriously consider the recognition of. Belgian rule in the Congo, and thus close a disagreeable chapter in the history of our relations with this country."</quote>
I speak with submission, but in that last phrase I seem to recognise what has been, perhaps, a weakness in our whole treatment of the matter&#x2014;namely, that looked at from Brussels and not from Africa, the happiness or unhappiness of our relations with Belgium bulk rather larger than the happiness or the unhappiness of the natives of the Congo. I cannot but think it matter for regret that, in view of those reasons which I have tried to state for a considerable remainder of anxiety on the part of this country about the future action of Belgium, Sir Arthur Hardinge went in front of his chief, and I may almost say half committed his chief to a course of recognition, instead of, for the remainder of the time at the very least, leaving whatever power the withholding of recognition gives in the hands of the Home Government.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01183">I hope I have not occupied your Lord ships' attention too long. I should like to ask the noble Viscount who represents the Foreign Office whether he can give us any satisfaction on the matter, and in particular whether he can tell us that the Foreign Office&#x2014;we have, I believe, an assurance that it will not proceed without giving an opportunity to Parliament and to the country of considering what it intends to do&#x2014;will not proceed without considering very gravely whether before recognition there should not be some more distinct assertion by the Belgian Government that what it has been largely doing, and what it purposes still further
<col>596</col>
to do in the remainder of the area within a few months, shall represent a permanent change in the method of administration, and shall therefore give at the eleventh hour to the peoples of the Congo, and to those who on this side of the water are looking to the credit of the white races in Africa, the guarantee which has been so often asked.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01184"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, last year the most rev. Primate called the attention of the House to this grave matter. He took a slightly different tone from that of the right rev. Prelate who has just addressed us, and who certainly need not for a moment have apologised for detaining us too long. We all listened to what he said with the greatest interest and attention. But last year the most rev. Primate admitted that we needed to exercise great patience in forming our opinions and stating our demands as to measures to be taken by the Belgian Government in what he called truly a limited region shrouded from our view, and I think the right rev. Prelate who has just spoken has not quite made allowance enough for the enormous difficulties which are interposed in the way of getting correct and authentic and sound information. At the same time, the Government have no complaint whatever to make of the right rev. Prelate for introducing the matter.<lb/>
Last year the most rev. Primate used what I thought was a very good expression. He warned us that after one great step in reform had been taken, and before its fruits were reaped, time was a great narcotic. But, apart from that, there is no lassitude and no indifference in the public mind in this country at this moment. What there is is a feeling that the arduous experiment of the transformation of the system of government of the Congo from the terrible system that did prevail, and the substitution for it of a system more conformable to decent humanity, is a thing which does take time and which requires consideration. For example, when the American Union had their great struggle for the abolition of slavery there was impatience, of course, but sensible people felt&#x2014;in fact circumstances made them feel&#x2014;that there could not in a moment be substituted for the system of slavery in the Southern States of the American Union a free system; and in our own case&#x2014;though I do not remember the details&#x2014;I am pretty sure that from
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0324"/>
<col>597</col>
the first step when we abolished the slave trade there was a long interval before a satisfactory substitution of a new system came into force. So now, without in the least wanting to relax the pressure of opinion in this country, we must still be perfectly just and reasonable in the demand which we make either in the shape of public opinion or through the Foreign Office.<lb/>
There is a suspicion&#x2014;and the right rev. Prelate has given voice to it&#x2014;which I think is as yet an unreasonable suspicion, that somehow or another the recognition of the annexation of this unregulated zone on July 1 of this year when the third zone is finally taken in, is going to be something surreptitious and outside of public view. This is not so, and I wish that the right rev. Prelate had given a little more emphasis to Sir Edward Grey's definite and emphatic declaration. So far from anything surreptitious being possible after a declaration of that kind, I think the right rev. Prelate will feel that any suggestion of surreptitiousness is thoroughly beside the mark. Sir Edward Grey has said, not once but two or three or four times, that His Majesty's Government will not recognise the Belgian annexation of the Congo until he can lay before Parliament evidence that the state of affairs as to the condition of the natives and the freedom of trade is satisfactory. So far as the third zone is concerned, the zone that is yet under the old system, we do not think that the reports received and laid before Parliament would justify recognition. When the third zone has been thrown open&#x2014;that is, placed on the same footing as the other two zones&#x2014;we shall before recognition have to be convinced that the condition of affairs in that zone is satisfactory or that the measures taken are calculated to ensure that at an early date. I think that in view of a declaration of this kind any notion that the Government have the slightest idea of letting recognition of the annexation by Belgium slide through unobserved is not reasonable.<lb/>
Something has been said by the right rev. Prelate of a pledge on our part to insist on the rights of the native population to dispose freely of the produce of their land and labour. That pledge, it is said, has not been made absolutely secure. I am sure the right rev. Prelate will not suspect me of any desire to play fast and loose with what has been a revolting subject, but what is
<col>598</col>
now, I do really believe, a hopeful subject, and I think the right rev. Prelate used no language that did not indicate that he held hopes both of the good faith of the Belgian Government and of the strenuousness of our own efforts to do what we can to influence Belgian opinion. And let us note, as that expression has fallen from me that there is in Belgium a very strong public opinion, which finds voice from time to time in the Belgian Chamber, of aversion to all the odious abominations and atrocities that marked the rule of a deceased Sovereign in the Congo. Let us take note of that, as I am quite sure the right rev. Prelate does. The Congo Reform Association say that that pledge has not been made absolutely secure; and the devoted secretary of the Congo Reform Association, in a letter to the noble Earl who is sitting opposite, says that&#x2014;

The Belgian Government could not reasonably be expected to condemn the State ownership of vacant land, but they have renounced the system of working the produce of the land. They are pleased with the result of the change effected, and have, we believe, no intention whatever of reversing decisions which were only arrived at after deliberate reflection.<lb/>
I do not know what more you can ask from a Government, which, after all, is a respected and important Government. We cannot ask for a better guarantee by the State of its desire to reform the system of administration than the new system which they have introduced. It is admitted that in the two zones already dealt with they have introduced a new system. Surely the
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0325"/>
<col>599</col>
right rev. Prelate does not expect us to ask the Belgian Government to bind themselves for all time not to change their system again&#x2014;that is to say, not to have a reaction and swing back from reform to the old detestable state of things? Surely everybody in the House will say that for us to use language of that kind would be to use futile and rather insulting language to a friendly and apparently reasonably zealous Government. If in the future&#x2014;this is my answer to the right rev. Prelate&#x2014;the Belgian Government of the day chooses to revert to the hateful system of which we have seen the end in two zones, and shortly shall, we hope, in the third zone, it will be for the British Government of that day to take the step and make the energetic remonstrance which the right rev. Prelate would expect.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01189"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF WINCHESTER</member><membercontribution>: Would the noble Viscount allow me to ask him whether he does not think that the explicit reservation which the Belgian Government now makes of a right to revert to the old system is not a fair subject of challenge on the part of the British Government?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01190"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: I will not argue whether it is a fair subject of challenge or not. But I am sure the right rev. Prelate is alive to this, that Governments carrying on dealings with one another have to choose the particular moment before they press this or that point, and they have to deal with that point for example in connection with their own whole attitude towards Congo reform. I do not think that is an unreasonable line to take. Now to go a little more into detail. The right rev. Prelate spoke about suspicion. Any one can see that if the Belgian Government were to put back the men who took an active part in the hateful administration which everybody now condemns, it would be an obvious and gross evil, and would really nullify paper reforms. Everybody agrees to that. But there, again, let us look at the White Paper to which the right rev. Prelate referred. At Page 49 Sir Edward Grey, writing to Sir Arthur Hardinge, says&#x2014;
<quote>"You are authorised to make such use of Mr. Armstrong's Despatch in conversation with M. Davignon or M. Renkin as you think fit, and you should point out the inference that there can be little hope of really satisfactory progress so long as the present class of officials remains unchanged."</quote>
I quote that to show that the Foreign Office are alive to the mischief, and that they have
<col>600</col>
instructed our Ministers at Brussels to represent that view to the responsible persons in Brussels. Therefore I think that on the point of the old officials their withers are unwrung.<lb/>
The right rev. Prelate will not think it unreasonable if I make one or two remarks about the sending of new officials to the Congo. It is obvious to every one of us&#x2014;I am sure the noble Earl opposite will recognise it&#x2014;that you cannot change offhand in a few months, or even in a year or two, all the officials who have experience of the country and know the ways of the natives, and so forth. It is not a very easy thing to do. It is also not very easy to find a number of officials in Belgium or anywhere else who are willing to go into a remote and most unhealthy region. You want a great mass of patriotic and humane men willing to undertake those burdens off-hand. Then I would say that some of the officials complained of in the concessions region&#x2014;this, I admit, is a very disquieting point, but it only touches those regions where the Belgian Government are only very secondarily responsible&#x2014;are put in by those companies whom the Belgian Government have naturally considerable difficulty in supervising and restraining. In the debate on the Congo Budget in the Belgian Chamber, I think last February, the Colonial Minister, M. Renkin, said&#x2014;and this I am sure the right rev. Prelate will accept as a final answer to that particular point in his statement of the case&#x2014;that means would be taken to raise the standard of all officials in the Congo service, that their salaries would be raised, that officers of bad character and tradition would not be retained, and where required a complete reorganisation would be effected. That seems to me, as I am sure it will to everybody, to be thoroughly satisfactory.<lb/>
Then as to State trading, I think the right rev. Prelate mentioned the ivory trade. It certainly is made much of, and justly, by those who are concerned in this matter. It is stated that the Belgian Government is a keen and interested and&#x2014;the word is used&#x2014;dishonourable competitor in ivory. That is all very well. But what did M. Renkin say last December in the Belgian Chamber? He is the responsible Minister, and he said that he had given definite orders that all purchases of ivory were to cease and come to an end on the opening up of the Congo in the successive stages of freeing trade, and
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0326"/>
<col>601</col>
when the last step is taken on July 1 of this year there is to be a cessation also of the exploitation of the land, so little eager is the Belgian Government to enter into these dealings which are so open to suspicion and doubt. I should like to quote, if the House will allow me, from a Despatch, or Report, sent to the Foreign Office dated February 12 last, which ought to quiet apprehension and misgiving on the subject of ivory. It will be recollected that formerly all ivory had to be taken to a Government station to be stamped; one tusk out of two became the property of the State, and the State officials usually took the opportunity of persuading the native to sell his second tusk very cheap. I think we can guess what that means. M. Renkin has now stated that this is to be discontinued, and it seems that the native can, if he chooses, redeem the tusk hitherto handed over as duty. This is a very great advantage to the native and to the trader. The expense of obtaining two tusks is the same as the expense of obtaining one, and if the duty of 18 francs a kilo, leaves any margin of profit, it is clearly to the native's advantage to pay for and take away both tusks. Also the European trader will probably be glad to get as much ivory into his hands and out of the hands of the State as he can.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01196"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: The most rev. Primate is not wrong in taking it for granted that any document will be laid on the Table, if necessary, to show that I am not reading a concocted passage. Now with regard to forced labour. The right rev. Prelate dealt, quite naturally,
<col>602</col>
with the point that while proposing to employ forced labour&#x2014;it is not denied that forced labour is employed&#x2014;only for works of public utility, such a construction has been put on that convenient phrase "public utility" as to include all kinds of work, and that many pretended volunteers are really men who are forced to work. I quote again M. Renkin, the Colonial Minister. He says that the moment the Belgian Government heard of these proceedings they condemned and forbade them, and that they have not ! been repeated. No Consular Reports that the Foreign Office have had show that M. Renkin is wrong. There is nothing to show that the Belgian Government have not done their best to forbid that, and they believe that that is so. But let us look at this like men who realise the difficulties of introducing all the refinements and necessities of civilisation into these backward and barbarous places. You cannot do it off-hand, and it may be and I dare say it is&#x2014;in spite of there being no information from our Consul that M. Renkin was wrong or over-stated his case when he said this&#x2014;not at all improbable that Belgian officials in far-off and distant places may be attempting to bring pressure to bear upon natives to work where labour is scarce. I hope nobody will think that His Majesty's Government will not do the very best they can to ask the Belgian Government to keep their eye upon that if it is necessary. But still we have to look at it reasonably, and we must not suppose that we have a complete monopoly of the gifts and the faculties and the human feelings which go to make these rough places smooth.<lb/>
The right rev. Prelate said something about finance. I will only trouble the House with one single figure. I am now referring to the Congo Budget, which says that the excess of expenditure over revenue is twenty-two million francs. This sum represents the excess of expenditure proposed for 1912 over the revenue estimated as available during that year, and in the face of a figure of that kind we cannot reasonably suggest that the Belgian Government is wringing excessive taxation out of the country concerned. In the last Report we have, which has in truth just arrived&#x2014;it is one since the White Paper was printed&#x2014;this is what is said by, I think, a Consul, but it is official at any rate and it is full of details. It gives details of this
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0327"/>
<col>603</col>
place and that place and the other place, but as the names are difficult to pronounce I will not attempt to pronounce them, and I do not think anybody in the House would be the wiser if I read every page of the Report. I will, therefore, read a sort of summary of it&#x2014;
<quote>"The Belgian Government has lightened the burden of taxation to the native in areas where poverty and poor economic conditions rendered exemption advisable. &#x2026; While the measures of 1911 are, indeed, dwarfed in their scope and importance compared with the epoch-making Acts of 1910 throwing the Congo open to unfettered trade in three zones, they cannot be regarded as a whole other than tending in the same wholesome direction. The policy inaugurated in 1910 has therefore, at least as reflected in the Legislative Acts of the Government, continued to pursue its course through 1911 along lines that make for the betterment of the Congo, its people and its commerce."</quote>
I am sure the right rev. Prelate will be delighted to hear testimony of that kind. It is satisfactory, and I have every reason to suppose that it is a veracious estimate of the actual state of things. I have said already that there is a strong and wholesome public opinion in Belgium, and what has been said in the papers the right rev. Prelate is well acquainted with. See what is said by Mr. Harris, whose authority is accepted, and not unjustly, by the Congo Association. This is dated December 30, 1911&#x2014;
<quote>"We are glad to recognise the great change that has come over the Congo, and are prepared to extend an encouraging and even a warm eulogy on the Belgian Government, and more especially on King Albert, for the disappearance of certain features of the old <i>r&#x00E9;gime.</i> There are facts which it would be folly to ignore, and these facts give rise to certain questions."</quote>
It is quite true that there are undoubtedly some facts which it would be folly to ignore, but do let us have in our minds that declaration that he, a zealous missionary, is prepared to extend an encouraging and warm eulogy on the Belgian Government.<lb/>
I should like to read also from the Report of the Congo Association Paragraph 9 on Page 33, referring to the Consuls' Reports&#x2014;
<quote>"Accompanied as they are by sundry warnings and grave criticism, the Consuls' reports in so far as they deal with the reformed areas are encouraging, and the opinions of a number of missionaries therein quoted the Association rejoices to note. There can be no doubt that the present situation in the reformed areas is altogether different from what it was, and the Association is the less likely to wish to minimise these improvements, since it is able with some justice to claim that its own labours have not been foreign to securing them."</quote>
It is perfectly true that you have to deal with the future. All we can say about the future is that the success of the policy of the
<col>604</col>
past, due to the Belgian Government, and, of course, to pressure within Belgium and from outside, encourages us to hope that the future will continue the growth of that harvest which we have already obtained.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01197"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I did not come down to the House this afternoon with any intention of speaking on this subject, for the truth is I have rather lost touch with Congo affairs lately. Neither should I speak now if it had not been that one or two allusions have been made to my opinions in the course of this debate. The right rev. Prelate said with great truth that what was required was a thorough change of system in the Congo, and that the system of the past was absolutely vicious from beginning to end. There cannot be a doubt of that. But I, perhaps, go rather further than the right rev. Prelate in condemning that system, for I think its main defect was that the same governing body was concerned with commercial enterprise and administration. That system has been tried, as your Lordships are aware, many times in other countries&#x2014;by the old East India Company in India, and elsewhere. It always has been a failure and I believe always will be a failure. Neither do I think that the Congo administration will be reformed until the whole of that system is swept away. But I quite admit the enormous difficulties the Belgian Government would have to encounter in sweeping it away, and I almost doubt, with the best intentions possible, whether it would be feasible for any Government to do so. All we can hope for is that they will make as many improvements as they can and move forward in the desired direction. I do not think any one can fairly ask for more than that.<lb/>
I was very glad the noble Viscount read that passage in Mr. Harris's letter. I had intended to bring it down to the House myself, but unfortunately left the paper on my table. No doubt great improvements have been made, but at the same time a great deal remains to be done. The only really practicable question to-day is recognition&#x2014;that is, I believe, the <i>crux</i> of the whole matter; and I think that the noble Viscount's expression on this subject ought to go a long way to satisfy the friends of Congo reform. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, as I understand, has not given any sort of pledge that he will recognise annexation at all. His hands are
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0328"/>
<col>605</col>
absolutely free in the matter. All he says Is that he will be prepared to consider it, and he has further given a pledge that there will be no recognition until such time as the Papers have been laid before Parliament and Parliament and public opinion have had an opportunity of informing themselves on the subject and expressing their opinion. I do not think we can ask for more than that.<lb/>
We must bear in mind that the Belgian Government are in a very difficult position. They have inherited a bad system for which they are in no way responsible themselves, and I think they must have a fair chance of reforming it. When it comes to subsequent recognition I am bound to confess&#x2014;without pledging myself at all to any very specific opinion&#x2014;that I should not be in any too great a hurry to recognise, and I have no doubt that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has no intention of being in a hurry about it. As regards guarantees for the future, I quite see the force of what the noble Viscount says&#x2014;that it is a very difficult matter to deal with, and that you have to accept the declarations of a foreign Government. I am sure no one in this House or in the country wishes to cast the smallest reflection upon the good faith of the Belgian Government, but if in the course of the negotiations the Foreign Office can secure some additional guarantees to those already indicated, it would be a source of great satisfaction to the friends of Congo reform. All, therefore, that can be done is for His Majesty's Government not to relax their efforts in the direction of urging reform, and to hold over recognition until they can recognise with a clear conscience and in such a manner as will satisfy themselves and the public opinion which exists in this country on the subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01198"><member>LORD WOLVERTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I had rather hoped that the noble Viscount would have spoken a little later, because I have a question to ask to which I hope he will give me an answer. My justification for intervening in the debate is this. Some three years ago when returning from Rhodesia I purchased a riverside estate near to the borders of the Congo Free State. I have developed that estate, and I have just returned from that part of the world so that I possibly can speak with some authority as to what is going on there. I have listened to a good many debates on this subject, and as an actual neighbour of the Congo Free State I rejoice at the tone of the one we have heard
<col>606</col>
to-day. We want to be friendly and we want to be neighbours with our Belgian friends over the frontier. What sort of state do we live in out there? I only need mention the words "black peril" to indicate what it is. The natives in North-West Rhodesia and also in the Congo Free State do not walk about with hammers; they walk about with pistols. The authority of the white man, therefore, must be kept up. North-West Rhodesia is a country as big as France and Spain and the white population numbers only some 2,000 people, whereas the blacks number some 400,000. So everybody knows that the authority of the white man must be kept up, and the Belgian white man in the Congo is in exactly the same position as the English white man in North-West Rhodesia.<lb/>
There are only two ways into the Congo. One I cannot speak of; that is up the Congo River. There is another way which I can speak of; that is through Rhodesia. I had the pleasure the other day of going out with five Belgian officials on board the steamer to Cape Town, and I can assert with the utmost confidence that those; men were some of the finest citizens that Belgium could send out to govern the Congo. They were extremely popular on board the ship, and their usual banter was to say, "Have you got your return ticket, because you do not stay very long out there?" One of these gentlemen was asked by a fellow-passenger, "Have you your return ticket?" He said, "No, but I have a hundred dozen of champagne with me, and I am not going to return to my own country until I have drunk that up." I have told the House my idea of the class of man who is going into the country. I have, also to inform the House that North-West Rhodesia is very closely mixed up with the Congo. We are going to feed the Congo. They will have to rely upon us&#x2014;they rely upon us now&#x2014;for their markets, and, as I said before, anything which tends to upset the good feeling which now exists is contrary to the interests of people who are closely concerned in this matter.<lb/>
The noble Viscount spoke of the difficulty of getting information about the Congo. The present Secretary to the Administrator in Zanzibar, whom I had the pleasure of lunching with and having a conversation with the other day, being in the Foreign Office was sent out by the
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0329"/>
<col>607</col>
Foreign Office to the Congo, where he learnt the language. He told me that he spent two or three years in the Congo studying this question, and I would like to ask the noble Viscount whether we can have the report of this gentleman. If we could, I think it would go very far to allay any spirit of anxiety with regard to affairs in the Congo.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01199"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure we have all been interested in the personal knowledge which my noble friend possesses of the region under discussion. I only rise to express the same feeling which he has expressed of satisfaction that in the debate expressions have not been used which could be complained of in any quarter. At the same time I do not think that the right rev. Prelate will feel that he has lost his time this evening, because the whole tenor of the speech of the noble Viscount opposite led to the feeling that, whatever has been done&#x2014;and we are very pleased at the advance which has been made&#x2014;we cannot regard the change of administration as in any sense complete, and certainly we are a considerable distance apparently from realising the hope expressed by our representative in Brussels, to which attention was called by the right rev. Prelate, that within a year&#x2014;that is to say, about the present time&#x2014;it would be possible for the Foreign Secretary, consistent with the attitude he has throughout maintained, to recognise or at least to seriously consider the recognition of Belgian rule in the Congo. I hope I have not misinterpreted what fell from the noble Viscount when I say that he regards the changes which are to take place this year&#x2014;the abolition of the rubber tax alluded to in the same Despatch and monopoly in every district and the attempt to place the administration on a sounder basis&#x2014;as an experiment which is to be carefully watched, and which is not to be prejudged as successful until we have before us evidence of its success. I am not sure whether I am speaking accurately in saying that there was some undertaking given by the Foreign Secretary that recognition would not take place without the consent of Parliament.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01204"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: I must apologise for again interrupting the noble Viscount. The words of Sir Edward Grey have always been that he will not recognise until he can lay before Parliament evidence that the state of affairs as to the condition of the natives and freedom of trade is satisfactory. When the third zone has been thrown open, we shall, before we can recognise, have to be convinced that the condition of affairs in that zone is satisfactory. But it is to come before Parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01205"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: I am much obliged to the noble Viscount. Might I ask one other concession? In the debate last year the noble Viscount used language in which he apologised for the absence of information, to which the right rev. Prelate drew attention again to-night. The information laid before us has been singularly retarded. At the close of the debate last year I did call the noble Viscount's attention to his own remarks, and he used the words that&#x2014;
<quote>"within a near measure of time we shall be informed of what has taken place."</quote>
He merely urged as a reason for not laying Papers at the moment that although Despatches had passed&#x2014;the very Despatches to which the right rev. Prelate has drawn our attention to-night&#x2014;he thought it desirable that the reports from the district, which would give us really solid information as to what had taken place, should be laid at the same I time as these Despatches. That discussion took place on May 1 last year. The Despatch from Sir Arthur Hardinge was replied to on March 31, and the accounts from the district for which the noble Viscount claimed some short latitude of time left Boma on May 30, and I have no doubt were received in this country about the time of the Coronation. I think, therefore, that we have been a little hardly treated, and that the pledge of the noble Viscount has been rather liberally interpreted by the Foreign Office in reserving the whole of these accounts
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0330"/>
<col>609</col>
until November last before publication. It seems to me an unreasonable period. I only venture to call attention to that because in reality, if we are to avoid recrimination on thin subject, if the occasional reports which reach us which are unfavourable are not set right by the full official reports which enable us to take a more general view, it certainly leads to the reiteration of criticisms which we should desire to avoid. We consider quite satisfactory the pledge which the noble Viscount has given us as regards the question of recognition, but I would urge at the same time that as Papers become available we should have them at the earliest possible moment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01206"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall not detain your Lordships more than a moment. I should like to express my sense of the value of this discussion. The noble Viscount was good enough to refer to a phrase which I had used in the debate that took place last year, to the effect that in matters of this sort time is apt to be a narcotic. It is quite possible, while other events certainly not the least momentous or stirring in our history are seething around us, that matters like this may very easily pass into the region of neglect or oblivion in the view of the public, and a debate like this is a stimulus which counteracts that narcotic, and believe that to-day we have a right to feel that what has passed will not only stimulate public interest but is entitled also to stimulate public hopefulness. I think that we have a right to feel, after what we have heard to-day, increasingly hopeful as to the outcome of the endeavours which are now being made in the face of very grave difficulties, which we should be exceedingly wrong to underrate, by the Belgian Government and the Belgian King.<lb/>
I should like if one may do so without; impropriety, to say how certain I am that there is a general sense throughout this country of our wish to support the Belgian Monarch at this moment in entering upon a task so extraordinarily difficult as that which befell him personally, for he was able to bring personal knowledge to bear and personal experience to play upon the ameliorative work in which I am quite certain His Majesty is as keenly interested as any one in this House can, be. We have heard to-day fresh grounds for hoping that the efforts which are being I made are not merely genuine&#x2014;that we
<col>610</col>
do not for a moment doubt, at least I do not for a moment doubt it&#x2014;but are likely to be fruitful. The noble Viscount has read a report, which has been circulated widely in this country, from Mr. Harris, a man whose evidence upon this subject is of first-class character as regards expert knowledge and experience, and also as regards the calmness which he has shown in situations and under provocation which might easily have led a man to take an exceedingly one-sided view. The value that we attach to his testimony is very high, and I am glad that it should have been quoted publicly in the House tonight.<lb/>
And what is in one sense more important still&#x2014;I do not know that it is really more important, but officially it is more important&#x2014;is the testimony which the noble Viscount has quoted from Despatches or Papers which we shall see in due time. The Consular Reports which the noble Viscount has quoted evidently give a similarly encouraging account. The noble Viscount misinterpreted me if he thought that I was in any way criticising the authenticity of these Reports, because I am sure the noble Viscount would be the last to quote them unless we were to have an opportunity ourselves of shortly reading them. It is to be remembered that the last letter of any kind that we have of an official nature in this matter is dated October 27 last. The Papers from which the noble Viscount quoted were dated in February last, and were written some months after the last Despatches which we have had an opportunity of reading, and therefore I venture to hope that no long time is going to elapse before we shall have the satisfaction of seeing and reading the cheering and hopeful accounts to which he referred. But, my Lords, while I say that I believe that a discussion like this, and the speech of the noble Viscount especially, may stimulate hopefulness, I am quite sure that we should be wrong if we were to regard the need of observation and caution as having come to an end. There has been no allusion to-night to what seemed to me, as I read the Papers issued last November, to be a matter that requires elucidation. Whether it will be elucidated in the new Papers that are to be put forward I do not know, but there seems to be prevalent in Belgium an idea that once annexation has been recognised our share in the whole matter comes to an
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0331"/>
<col>611</col>
end as completely as though we were dealing with a Colony of Germany or France. I speak as a child in these matters of diplomacy and diplomatic history; but, if I am not mistaken, there has been nothing officially before the country in the least to lead us to imagine that the original Congo Treaties under which the Congo State came to its birth, and which were quite exceptional in character, would cease to be and would come to an end because what had formerly been the private property of King Leopold had become the property of the State and had been recognised as such.</membercontribution></p>

The very last words which appear in the White Paper distributed last November are in a letter from Sir Francis Villiers in reporting a conversation with M. Renkin, that M. Renkin in speaking of it said that&#x2014;
<quote>"he could have treated it in no other way, us the matter was one which exclusively concerned the internal administration of the Belgian colony."</quote>
That is a phrase which I venture to think will require to be elucidated if we are not to feel ourselves placed in a false position as being supposed to admit&#x2014;those of us who have been interested in this subject&#x2014;that the recognition of annexation, when that annexation comes, would relieve us of all responsibility in the matter.<lb/>
I earnestly hope that the conditions will be soon satisfied which Sir Edward Grey has promised will be precedent to that recognition, and that a marked improvement
<col>612</col>
will be shown by the Reports of Consuls which are to be placed in the hands of our authorities, and by the authorities placed before Parliament for its consideration. But I want to call attention to the fact that we who look at the matter from outside and think specially of the sufferings of the Congo natives are by no means of opinion that England's own responsibility will be over when recognition has taken place. I think it well to call attention to that factor to-night, because I believe it to be a most important element in our future consideration of this great and anxious subject.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01239"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (EARL LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is a Bill which requires a very short preface indeed. Its object is to remove doubts as to the validity of certain marriages solemnised in the Empire of Japan, one or both of the parties being British subjects. Before July 16, 1899, certain conditions regulated marriages in Japan, and marriages continued after that date to be celebrated in accordance with the old rules, but the effect of surrendering the extra-territorial jurisdiction was to imperil the validity of such marriages. Accordingly, it is only fair that marriages solemnised in good faith and in reliance on the continuance of the law should be made valid, subject to certain conditions&#x2014;namely, that the Bill shall not render valid any marriage which before the passing of the Bill had been declared invalid by any Court of competent jurisdiction, or affect any right dependent on the validity or invalidity thereof, or render valid any marriage either of the parties to which has subsequently during the life of the other lawfully intermarried with any other person.</membercontribution></p>

That measure is being proceeded with in another place this afternoon, and I understand that there are some hopes that it may pass through the House of Commons to-day. We are proposing, therefore, that a formal meeting of the House should in that event take place late to-night with a view to the Bill being read a first time, and in that case we would ask your Lordships to take the Second Reading to-morrow. I propose at the same time to put a Notice on the Paper which would entitle us, if necessary, to suspend the Standing Orders in order that, if the House agrees and desires, more than one stage may be taken on the same day. As to whether that course is one which we shall wish to follow I would prefer, if your Lordships would allow me, to leave

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01279"><b>1.</b>&#x2014;(1) A county council may, with the consent of the Local Government Board, purchase or accept the transfer of, and the owner of any existing ferry may sell or transfer to a county council, upon such terms as may be agreed on between the owner and the council, any existing ferry which is within the area of that council or which serves the inhabitants of that area.</p>
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0336"/>
<col>621</col>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01280">(2) Subject to the provisions of any Act of Parliament under which the ferry was established and to the rights of any other persons, the county council may work, maintain, and improve the ferry and charge such tolls as were legally chargeable in respect of the ferry before the sale or transfer thereof to the council, or such other tolls as the council, with the approval of the Local Government Board, may determine; or, with the approval of the Local Government Board, the council may, if they think fit, free the ferries from tolls, and shall have the rights and powers which the owner of the ferry possessed and shall be subject to the obligations and liabilities to which he was subject.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01281">(3) A county council may join with any other county council for the purchase or acceptance, working, maintenance, or improvement of a ferry under this Act, or may contribute towards the expenses of the purchase or acceptance, working, maintenance, or improvement of a ferry by another county council.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01282">(4) In this Act the expression "existing ferry" means any ferry legally established by Act of Parliament or otherwise at the date of the purchase or transfer, and includes all boats and other vessels, landing stages, approaches, apparatus, plant, and other property used in connexion with the ferry.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01283">(5) A county council may borrow for the purposes of this Act, under section sixty-nine of the Local Government Act, 1888, as if those purposes were mentioned in that section.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01284">(6) A county council may, if they consider that any expenses incurred by them under this Act in respect of any ferry not being for the purpose of a main road should, instead of being charged upon the whole county, be to an amount not exceeding one half specially charged on any parish or parishes in their county, charge those expenses upon that parish or those parishes as special expenses; and where any expenses are so charged as special expenses, any receipts in respect of the ferry shall be carried to a special county account for the benefit of the parish or parishes upon which the expenses are charged.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01285">(7) Section eighty-seven of the Local Government Act, 1888, which provides for local inquiries, shall apply to any cases where the Local Government Board are authorised to give any consent or approval under this Act as it applies to cases where the Local Government Board are authorised to give any consent or approval under the Local Government Act, 1888.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01286">(8) In this Act, the expression "county council" includes the council of a county borough, and the council of a county borough shall have the same power of borrowing for the purposes of this Act as they have under the Public Health Acts, 1875 to 1908, for the purpose of defraying any expenses incurred by them in the execution of those Acts.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01287"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT GALWAY</member> moved, in subsection (6), after the word "county" ["be to an amount not exceeding one half specially charged on any parish or parishes in their county"], to insert the words "specially benefited by that ferry," and to omit from the subsection the words "and where any expenses are so charged as special expenses, any receipts in respect of the ferry shall be carried to a special county account for the benefit of the parish

This was not intended, and after consultation with the Local Government Board I have put two Amendments on the Paper. The effect of these will be that before the county council decide what portion of the expenses should be charged on any parish or parishes benefiting from the ferry the whole of the receipts from the ferry will be placed in account against the expenses, and it would be from the balance against the receipts that the county council would consider about the charge on the parish or parishes.

<col>623</col>
of discussing with him its exact effect. I am not sure whether the noble Earl and the Board of Trade have exactly understood what the object of my Amendment was, because the Amendment which is moved to-day fails to secure the object at which I aimed. I ventured to say, in moving my Amendment in Committee, that its object was to secure the safety of the general public and the safety of passengers on these ferries, and to some extent the persons against whom the public need to be protected are the owners of the ferries. The noble Earl's Amendment would give the power to make regulations for this purpose to the county council, who may be the very people who require to be looked after in the interests of the public. The noble Earl says that county councils are more conversant with the needs of the locality. This is not a question of the needs of the locality. It is a question of the safety of the public in regard to the mode of working these ferries. Clause 2, as it reads now, gives the power to make these regulations to the Board of Trade, who are an independent body and not interested in working the ferries in an economical&#x2014;which may be a dangerous&#x2014;way, but are able to take their own line in the matter. I suggest that the noble Earl should withdraw this Amendment now and allow me to discuss the matter with him and see whether he cannot agree with me in attaining the object I bad in view&#x2014;namely, the protection of the public. If this Amendment is inserted to-day the public will be in no way protected in the case of a county council which is careless or indifferent. It may be said that no county council would be careless or indifferent, but it sometimes happens that when public works are managed by committees they are inclined to have regard more to economical working than to the safety of the public, and it may very well happen that they might fail in the case of these ferries to make such regulations as are necessary. The noble Earl in this Amendment reserves no power whatever to the Board of Trade to make regulations if the county council do not themselves make them. He has left it to the county council to make the regulations, and all that the Board of Trade can do is, if the regulations are made, to approve of them. I hope the matter will be considered further, because the clause as now proposed to be amended would be quite illusory for the protection of the public.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01302" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01303">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01304"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ROTHERHAM</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in moving the Second Reading of this Bill perhaps it is only right that I should explain that I undertake this duty at the special request of the Associated Chambers of Commerce of the United Kingdom. The Bill embodies no new ideas. Literally for scores of years the Chambers of Commerce have been clamouring for it, and so have Bankers Institutes and Trade Protection societies in various parts of the country. The principle of the Bill has also been accepted again and again by various Presidents of the Board of Trade. Its object is the very simple and the obviously fair one of keeping a register of the names of individual partners in a firm, so that when one firm is asked to give credit to another firm it may know whom individually it is asked to trust. The Bill would only affect those firms who are trading under names other than their own. It is not proposed to advertise the names of individual partners on the housetops or even in the newspapers, but merely to have the information available to interested parties who make application to the registry office and who pay on making that application a very moderate fee.<lb/>
In the past it has frequently happened that firms when requiring credit have as their references made mention of other firms, and the replies that have been received
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0338"/>
<col>625</col>
have been altogether satisfactory; but on investigation it has been found that the firms referred to have consisted of identically the same partners as the original firm which asked for credit. This Bill would have the effect of ending what is known as the "long firm" business. The practice of concealing the identity of the partners in private firms facilitates fraud and prejudices the honest trader. Various Parliamentary Committees have investigated this subject from time to time with a result invariably favourable to the principle of this Bill. So long ago as the year 1872 a Select Committee on Trade Partnerships reported as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"Your Committee have arrived at the conclusion that it is expedient that the real constitution of all firms should be known and that it is practicable to effect that object by a system of compulsory registration."</quote>
Then, again, a quarter of a century or more later a very important Departmental Committee sat to investigate our Bankruptcy Laws, and in the course of their very valuable and exhaustive Report there occurs this sentence&#x2014;
<quote>"We are of opinion that the compulsory registration of the names of all persons carrying on business in other than their own names would tend to prevent the giving of credit to persons who are not entitled to it, and to that extent to diminish the causes of insolvency."</quote><lb/>
So far as the practice of other countries is concerned, a Blue-book was published some four years ago which contained a Report on the practice in regard to the registration of firms obtaining in other countries. The inquiry was set on foot at the special request of the Board of Trade two years previously. The question was investigated thoroughly, and when the Report was finally presented it was found to contain these words&#x2014;
<quote>"From the replies received it appears that all the foreign countries concerned have legislation on the subject with the exception of Abyssinia."</quote>
So that, my Lords, it is left to us with the biggest trade of the world, as measured <i>per capita</i> anyhow, to be classed with Abyssinia, and alone with Abyssinia to suffer under this disability. It is because the commercial opinion of the country thinks that that condition of timings should be remedied that I hope the House will consent to the Second Reading of this Bill. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<col>626</col>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01306"><member>THE EARL OF GRANARD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this Bill, as my noble friend has correctly stated, has been before the country for many years. It was considered by a Select Committee in the year 1900. My noble friend said that all opinion was invariably favourable to this Bill, but I am afraid I must dissent in some way from that, especially as regards the Select Committee of 1900. For that Committee said&#x2014;
<quote>"The Committee are of opinion that the principle of the Bill should only be accepted in a measure more complete and practical than that referred to the Committee, and they are therefore not prepared to advise Parliamentary sanction being given to it."</quote>
But the Committee expressed the opinion that the subject was well deserving of consideration. That happened in the year 1900. I think there is no doubt that there is a great deal to be said for the principle of the Bill, but I think sonic of its details are open to criticism. It might, for instance, be very hard to keep the register of these firms up to date, and, in addition to that, it is always difficult to technically say who is a partner and who is not. Also as regards the particular financial point in the Bill such as the registration, I am not prepared to say that the sum of 5<i>s.</i> would adequately pay for the incidental expenses. Consequently some expense might fall on the country. While the Board of Trade and the Government agree with the principle of the Bill, I think it is only right that after a lapse of twelve years it should be again considered by a Select Committee in view of the finding of the Committee in 1900, which was in no way unanimous in favour of the Bill. If the noble Lord will allow the Bill to go to a Select Committee, the Government will offer no opposition to its being read a second tune to-day.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01322"><member>LORD MONK BRETTON</member><membercontribution>: I have four Amendments on the Paper. The first three of them constitute really one Amendment, and I ask your Lordships to allow me to take them together. My object is to secure that the Minute to be laid before the House of Commons by the Home Secretary stating the reasons for levying a rate beyond 10<i>d.</i> should also be laid before your Lordships' House, and that the Paper should be governed by the same procedure as is laid down in the Bill with regard to another place. I think the members of His Majesty's Government will agree that that would not be a very great concession to make from the point of view of the Bill, because I do not think they would say that if they could show that the money was actually required for the current needs of the police it is likely that your Lordships would move an Address to the Crown praying that the necessary money should not be raised.<lb/>
It cannot be contended that this Amendment is in any way contrary to the privileges of the House of Commons. Your Lordships had this Bill before you in December last and you threw it out. It was not then proclaimed a Money Bill under the Parliament Act, neither has it been proclaimed so this year. I do not know whether it may be contended that the privilege question comes in because it is an affair of local taxation. I imagine that there may be authorities&#x2014;such great authorities, perhaps, as Sir T. Erskine May&#x2014;who may be quoted on this subject. But even in the slight Parliamentary experience I have had a Bill immediately occurs to me&#x2014;it is a case in point affecting the rates&#x2014;which was amended by your Lordships' House and which is the law of the land today. I mean the measure which I had the honour to be in charge of in your Lordships' House&#x2014;the Asylum Officers Superannuation Act of 1909. Amongst other Amendments which your Lordships inserted, and which were agreed to by His Majesty's Government here, was one to cut down the number of years which a
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0340"/>
<col>629</col>
man had to serve in an asylum in order to get a pension. That Amendment directly affected the rates. There was another Amendment which had reference to the age of asylum officers, and that, again, directly affected the rates.<lb/>
As I do not think, therefore, that the question of privilege can be raised, I will call your Lordships' attention to the extremely important precedent which is set, not by the Amendment which I have on the Paper, but by the clause as it stands. On the Second Reading I quoted five Acts of Parliament which had been passed in the last three years in all of which it was provided that certain documents should be laid on the Table of the House and that your Lordships could take exception to them. One of those Acts was the Finance Act of 1910. In all those cases&#x2014;and I believe in every case in recent legislation&#x2014;when Papers have been ordered to be so laid they have always been required to be laid on the Table of both Houses of Parliament, and I do not think that the noble Lord will be able to quote any recent cases, or any case at all, in which a direction has been given in an Act of Parliament that the Papers shall be laid on the Table of one House of Parliament only. I venture to say that this is a very important matter indeed. It is a matter which concerns the prerogative of your Lordships' House. I will go further and say that it is a matter which concerns the prerogative of the Senate which His Majesty's Government are going to set up in the place of your Lordships' House, and it is a matter which concerns any reformed House which noble Lords in other parts of the House may wish to set up. It is a matter which affects the whole relations between the two Houses. That being so, it seems to me that it is an unpardonable thing to create a precedent of such magnitude as this. I hope that His Majesty's Government will accept this Amendment, and I trust that the kindly attitude which I understood Lord Ashby St. Ledgers to take up with regard to this point at the conclusion of the debate on the Second Reading will be continued, and that he will allow this Amendment to proceed.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01325"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the effect of this Amendment would be that this House or the House of Commons might take objection to the second penny rate being used by the Secretary of State for the Home Department. The noble Lord alluded to the fact that at the conclusion of the Second Reading debate in this House I held out some hope that the Government might see their way to meet your Lordships on this point. But I never contemplated that this House should have a separate right to object to the levy, but that perhaps both Houses together might share the responsibility of taking that objection. The noble Lord goes far beyond anything that I suggested as being at all within the bounds of possibility with regard to this matter. I should like the House to understand that before I proceed any further.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01326"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: Would the noble Lord explain what he means by the two Houses acting jointly? Is there any precedent for that?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01327"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: meant that if objection was taken in both Houses to the imposition of the rate then the rate should not be imposed. As it stands in this Amendment the provision is that if either House takes objection to the imposition then the imposition shall not be made. There is a substantial difference. I think the Government would have been disposed to do all in their power to meet the wishes of noble Lords opposite on this point. I may say, in parentheses, that they have no desire whatever to limit, to weaken, or to diminish the safeguard which is contained in this subsection, and which was inserted to a great extent at the instance of the noble Viscount opposite. But there is considerable doubt, to put it no higher, whether this House can insert the Amendment now proposed without going some way at any rate to challenge the other House on a question of privilege.<lb/>
I will, with your Lordships' permission, read a few sentences from that eminent authority, Sir Erskine May. In his "Parliamentary Practice" Sir Erskine May says [Page 574]&#x2014;
<quote>"&#x2026; the Lords are excluded, not only from the power of initiating or amending Bills dealing with public expenditure or revenue, but also from initiating public Bills which would create a charge upon the people by the imposition of local and other rates.
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0341"/>
<col>631</col>
&#x2026; It follows, accordingly, that the Lords may not amend the provisions in Bills which they receive from the Commons dealing with the above-mentioned subjects, so as to alter, whether by increase or reduction, the amount of a rate so charged&#x2014;its duration, mode of assessment, levy, collection, apportionment, or management."</quote>
That seems fairly clear. At any rate, in Sir Erskine May's opinion what your Lordships are proposing to do would constitute a breach of the privileges of the House of Commons, because it is quite clear that the only object of the Amendment would be to enable this House, if it saw fit, to reduce the rate imposed by the Secretary of State for police purposes.<lb/>
I would also like to point out that the noble Viscount himself seems to have been conscious of this possible objection when he spoke on the subject last year, because he strictly limited his demand to a House of Commons Motion. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"In several measures which have passed the House it was required that the Act should not be put operation until a substantive Motion had been moved and carried in both Houses. I do not here say both Houses of Parliament, but I do ask that if the Secretary of State, who cannot possibly for some years to come require more than an extra penny rate, desires to raise the other, he should give a pledge that a substantive Motion should be moved in the House of Commons and carried before any portion of that further penny rate is applied to the service of the police."</quote>
I am quite prepared to admit that this is not a substantive Motion, but it is a matter of machinery, and I cannot see, if the noble Viscount himself admits that in so far as his claim then was that it was a matter for the House of Commons and for the House of Commons alone, how he can now say that the alteration in the form in which it at present stands entitles this House to interfere. At any rate that is the view we take on the subject.<lb/>
It is for your Lordships to consider whether it would be wise on a matter of this kind to raise a possible question of privilege with the other House. We think that it would be injudicious at any rate, and we think that the safeguard already provided is amply sufficient to meet the objection which the noble Viscount raised last session. I do not really think that he would strengthen the safeguard by the proposal which he and his friends now desire to include, and I think it would have the undesirable effect of raising a question of privilege at this stage.</membercontribution></p>
<col>632</col>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01328"><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I had hoped, after the conciliatory attitude adopted by the noble Lord in charge of the Bill on the Second Reading, that there would be no necessity to support the Amendment moved by my noble friend Lord Monk Bretton, but Lord Ashby St. Ledgers has raised the question of privilege, and on those grounds, and on those grounds only as I understand, he refuses to accept the Amendment. The noble Lord quoted Sir Erskine May as to the powers of this House in regard to initiating or amending Bills relating to rates, but I do not think that the question of privilege can be raised in this case. The question of privilege would only apply to initiating or to amending Bills relating to rates. We are not amending a Bill relating to rates. What is in question here is whether Parliament shall concur in enforcing a certain rate or not, and the question as regards this House is as to whether this House would accept or reject that proposal. There is a great difference between the action proposed by my noble friend Lord Monk Bretton and what has been referred to by Lord Ashby St. Ledgers. I think there is really no need to go into the merits of this Amendment. After what has been stated both in another place and in this House it is quite certain that this second penny rate is not required. It may be required in the future to meet emergencies, but there most certainly ought to be sonic security that Parliament should have the opportunity of discussing the matter in a proper manner before this second penny is raised. In the figures which he gave us the other evening, the noble Lord in charge of the Bill only made out a case for a &#x00BE;<i>d.</i> rate. A &#x00BE;<i>d.</i> rate would amply cover all the requirements for the metropolitan police during the next year, and a penny rate would cover all police requirements for the next three years. I appeal to the noble Lord to accept this Amendment, the principle of which is not only accept able to, but is greatly desired by, the London Members in the House of Commons who usually support His Majesty's Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01329"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think the noble Lord, in replying to my noble friend Lord Monk Bretton, hardly realised the strength of the case which had been made for this Amendment. Lord Monk Bretton quoted a case where a change of rating had been made by this House very recently&#x2014;made without protest from the
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0342"/>
<col>633</col>
House of Commons, and made, as I understand, at the instigation of the Home Secretary who is now the protagonist in this miniature battle. I cannot feel that this is even so near a breach of the privilege of the House of Commons as was the action taken two years ago to which Lord Monk Bretton referred. Although the noble Lord in charge of the Bill quoted Sir Erskine May I do not think he carried his research quite far enough, because Sir Erskine May particularly limits the paragraph to which the noble Lord alluded by saying&#x2014;
<quote>"Even when Amendments by the Lords are an infringement of privilege&#x2014;</quote>
and I do not admit that this Amendment is an infringement of privilege&#x2014;
<quote>"it is not the invariable practice of the Commons to assert their claim regarding Amendments made to Bills that they have sent to the Lords which deal with relief of the poor, or with municipal, county, and local rates and assessments."</quote>
This is precisely a case in point. This is a Bill which deals with municipal rating and assessment. It is not a case of reducing a rate. That is not proposed. What is proposed is that we should obviate an absolutely new procedure being for the first time in the history of Parliament introduced into a Statute. It is important, I think, when the noble Lord says that the Government have done all in their power, that we should not allow this new standard to be set up, because that expression may be used again.<lb/>
With great respect to the noble Lord I say that the Government have not done everything in their power. There were two things in their power. The first was to put in an Amendment in the same terms as the provision which has figured in every public Bill&#x2014;namely, that either House, not both louses jointly, should have the opportunity of refusing the addition which either House had the opportunity of doing when the original Bill came forward. The second course open to the Government was to adopt the procedure which I suggested in the middle of a rather late and heated discussion in the very last moments of last session to obviate the extreme unpleasantness of haying to throw out the Bill, and that was that the Government should submit a substantive Motion. There is a precedent for that in the Man&#x0153;uvres Act, and it was pressed upon us by the noble Lord's friends, who forced us, in the case of setting up machinery for military man&#x0153;uvres, on every occasion to come to both Houses of Parliament with a substantive Motion which could be fully discussed.<lb/>
<col>634</col>
We ask that there shall be a discussion in the House of Commons, not at the last moment at night after eleven o'clock when it is practically certain that the Government can rush the thing through without adequate debate, as was done with this Bill last year before your Lordships dealt with it, but at a time when fair discussion can be given to this important point&#x2014;namely, whether the ratepayers of the metropolis are to bear the whole charge of raising the police not merely for Sunday rest but in order to deal with tumult in and out of London, or whether that is to be borne, as hitherto, partially by the Government. It is pretty clear that this is not and cannot be construed into a breach of privilege, and there is a specific declaration in Sir Erskine May's work that usually in cases of municipal rating, if there is a suspicion of infringement of privilege, the House of Commons waives its privilege. I therefore trust that when this Bill comes back it will have in it my noble friend's Amendment, and that the Government will see their way to close this controversy by not making it the occasion for entirely changing the custom of Parliament in this matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01330"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as the question of privilege has been raised in connection with this debate, it is, perhaps, desirable that I should say a word upon it. I am really not competent to enter into the particular merits of the special case in regard to the sum of money involved, so I will confine myself purely to the point of privilege as raised by this Amendment. It is perfectly true that this House has always taken the view, and in some respects and to a certain degree the other House has not altogether challenged that view, that matters of rating as regards breach of privilege cannot be held to be precisely <i>in pari muteria</i> with matters of taxing. That has always been contended here, and, as I say, it has not been altogether challenged in another place. But, on the other hand. I think it is important to bear in mind the subject-matter of this Bill and the occasion on which a breach of privilege may be alleged. As a rule when this House has claimed its right to insert Amendments in Bills in connection with rating, it has bean what one might term rating of the pariah pump character. But this is rather a different matter. The metropolitan police are in effect to a great extent a national service, and it can hardly
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0343"/>
<col>635</col>
be expected, I think, in considering matters affecting that force, that the House of Commons will be willing to take the view that the matter is one which only concerns the inhabitants of London in their capacity as ratepayers. Any question concerning the metropolitan police must also wear something of a national aspect, and it is for that reason that the particular question of privilege is much more likely to be raised in another place on a matter of this kind than it would be upon rating matters of purely local character, of a kind of which it would be possible to suggest a number of instances. I fear, therefore, that in another place the insertion of an Amendment of this kind would run a risk of being regarded not merely as an assertion of the right to differentiate, as we have done in the past on more than one occasion, between rating powers and taxing powers, but as involving something of an encroachment on the part of this House in dealing with a charge which, though in a literal sense rating, is yet concerned with matters of a national character. It is that consideration which makes me gravely doubt whether the House of Commons would be likely to take the course, which, of course, it is always entitled to take and sometimes does take, of waiving its privilege in a matter of this kind. I do not know that I can usefully add any more to this debate, beyond making to the House the serious reminder which I have ventured to make as to the course which it seems to me is likely to be pursued when the Bill goes elsewhere.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01331"><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think this particular Amendment in itself is one of great importance, but it raises a question which may become of great importance. I do not think the noble Marquess who leads the House acted quite fairly in trying to ride off on the Imperial nature of the metropolitan police, because the only point at issue in this Amendment is a rate paid only by the ratepayers of the metropolis. Therefore what we are considering is most distinctly and exclusively a rating and not a taxing matter. It is one of the admitted privileges and powers of this House to share with the other House of Parliament the right of making an Address to the Crown in respect of certain classes of administrative proposals. It is a very common provision in our Acts of Parliament, as your Lordships know, that certain rules or certain Orders lie
<col>636</col>
on the Table of both Houses of Parliament for a certain number of days and then acquire the force of law if no Address has been moved or carried against them in either House of Parliament. I venture to say that that is a power and privilege of real importance and substance, and I ask noble Lords opposite whether they can quote one single instance in all our Statutes of this privilege being confined to one House of Parliament only.<lb/>
I take it that noble Lords on the Front Bench opposite cannot name one single case in which this particular power has been given to the House of Commons only. Therefore when the noble Marquess who leads the House suggests that we may be guilty of an encroachment on the financial privileges of the House of Commons, I reply to him that the encroachment is quite in another direction. We have no desire to encroach on the financial privilege of the House of Commons, nor do we desire to raise unnecessarily the question of privilege; but on this the first occasion on which it is attempted to set a precedent in an Act of Parliament that this practice which has always hitherto been enjoyed by the two Houses should be now enjoyed only by one, we should be doing ill if we did not enter our protest, especially since it is not so many months ago that our powers and privileges were under the review of Parliament. If the House of Commons, if the Government, at the time of the Parliament Act had considered that this was a power of which we ought to be deprived, the House of Commons could have inserted a provision to that effect in the Parliament Bill, but the Parliament Bill was silent on the subject. Yet it is now suggested that we are quietly to submit at the instance, not of the House of Commons or of the Government, but of the Home Secretary alone, to the setting up of a precedent by which this power may be hereafter taken from us.<lb/>
I would go further, my Lords, and remind you that the Parliament Act affects this question in a two-fold manner. I have already pointed out that it is quite clear that those who framed the Parliament Act agreed that this was a privilege which it was for the benefit of the State we should continue to exercise, and which we have exercised hitherto for the benefit of the State. Sir Erskine May has been quoted as regards the privileges of the House of Commons. But since Sir Erskine May
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0344"/>
<col>637</col>
wrote his book the House of Commons itself has undertaken to put into Statute form some of its privileges, and I draw your Lordships' attention to this very important fact, that in the Parliament Act for the first time in a Statute is laid down a great distinction between the powers and position of this House in them atter of rates and the power and position of this House in the matter of taxes. Taking the fact that the House of Commons has itself quite willingly admitted of its own free will that the power of this House in regard to rates is different from our power in regard to taxes, and taking into consideration also the very serious nature of the encroachment on our powers and privileges which this particular provision may create in the nature of a precedent, I think your Lordships are indebted to my noble friend for having moved this Amendment, and I certainly hope, not only that your Lordships will place this Amendment in the Bill, but that the Government themselves will see that there really is a reasonable case in this matter, and that we are not raising unnecessarily a point of no importance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01332"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to repeat the question which has been addressed to the Front Bench opposite. Is there any precedent that can be found for laying Papers of this sort on the Table of the House of Commons only? Because, if no precedent can be found, we are taking a very serious step if we agree to this in this case. On the question of privilege, the noble Marquess who leads the House drew a distinction and appeared to rely on the fact that the metropolitan police force is more or less a national body. If it is a national body, then why does the nation not pay for it? This money is to be paid by the metropolitan ratepayers. In confirmation of what Lord Selborne said with regard to the Parliament Act, let me read to the House what that Act says. The Parliament Act distinctly says that Bills of this sort are not Money Bills. These are the words&#x2014;
<quote>"A Money Bill means a Public Bill which, in the opinion of the Speaker of the House of Commons, contains only provisions dealing with taxation;"</quote>
and at the end the Act says&#x2014;
<quote>"In this subsection the expression 'taxation,' 'public money,' and 'loan,' respectively do not include any taxation, public money, or loan raised by local authorities or bodies for local purposes."</quote>
<col>638</col>
This is a rate which is levied and raised by a local authority, and it appears to me that under those words there can be no question of this House invading the privileges of the other House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01333"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with regard to the question which has been raised in several quarters of the House as to whether there is any precedent for what is contemplated under this Bill, I would remind your Lordships that there is no precedent for any financial measure being made the subject of such a provision. As far as I know, up to the present time this practice has been confined to regulations under the Factory Acts and such like measures. There is no precedent at all for applying this process to a financial proposal. The responsibility for this innovation, if innovation it be, rests with noble Lords opposite. It was at the suggestion of the noble Viscount himself that this provision was inserted. When the Bill came up to your Lordships' House last session there was no subsection such as we are discussing to-day in it. It was the distinct wish of the noble Viscount that such a provision should be inserted. I have already quoted to your Lordships from the speech he made on that occasion, in which he distinctly asked that such a safeguard should be inserted in the Bill. If we have got on to fresh ground, and if a point has been raised for which there is no precedent, the responsibility for it, I say, rests with noble Lords opposite. But coming to another point, the noble Earl who has just sat down quoted from the Parliament Act, and pointed out to your Lordships that that Act definitely dissociated itself from having any concern with rating matters. Everything of that kind is distinctly left in the position in which it was before the Parliament Bill was introduced, and it is in that connection that I suggest that Sir Erskine May is an authority who should claim respect at your Lordships' hands.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01334"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Over an Act of Parliament?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01335"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: But the Act of Parliament definitely stated that these things were left, untouched, that no alteration in the relations of the two Houses with regard to rating should result from the Parliament Act. Therefore if we want to consider how matters stood before the
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0345"/>
<col>639</col>
passing of the Parliament Act, I think we may fairly look for guidance to the source which I have named. The noble Viscount taunted me that I did not pursue my studies of Sir Erskine May sufficiently far, and he told your Lordships, which I suppose your Lordships knew perfectly well, that it is quite within the competence of the other House to waive its privilege. But if the noble Viscount had read a little further beyond the sentence which he quoted he would have found the statement that the House of Commons are generally disposed to waive the question of privilege on an Amendment of a Money or Rating Bill&#x2014;
<quote>"when those Amendments affect charges upon the people incidentally only, and were made for the purpose of giving effect to the legislative intentions of the Commons."</quote>
I do not think that in this case it can be claimed that the Amendment which the noble Viscount is supporting has for its object giving effect to a legislative intention of the Commons; and I venture to agree with my noble friend who leads the House that it is not at all improbable that the House of Commons may take the view, especially if this is a new case, that this does constitute a breach of privilege.<lb/>
The noble Earl, Lord Selborne, told us that he did not attach very much importance to this Amendment. He said it was not a very important matter, but he claimed that out of it arose important considerations. In itself he attached very little importance to the Amendment moved by the noble Lord. If it is unimportant&#x2014;and I agree with him it is not very important&#x2014;I put it to your Lordships whether on an unimportant issue it is desirable to raise with the other House a question of privilege. Anyhow, we cannot accept the Amendment, and although we do not wish to put your Lordships to the trouble of dividing on the subject, it must be clearly understood that we dissociate ourselves from any participation in the matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01336"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: I venture to say that the raising of a question of privilege in the other House will depend on the attitude of the Government. If the Government are determined to make one procedure for the Act of 1909 and another procedure for this Bill, they can do so. It is entirely for them to decide whether they will force the House of Commons to insist on its privilege, which on many occasions it has decided to waive.</membercontribution></p>
<col>640</col>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01337"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Viscount is not accurate in saying that the raising of a question of privilege depends on the action of His Majesty's Government in another place. The raising of a question of privilege depends upon the attitude of the officers of the House of Commons. They call attention to a breach of privilege if they conceive that one exists. Whether the breach of privilege should be waived may depend upon the advice given by His Majesty's Ministers, which may, and presumably would, be followed by the majority of the members of the House, but the calling of attention to a breach of privilege is not the business of His Majesty's Government. It is the business of the officials of the House of Commons.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01349"><member>THE DUKE OF DEVONSHIRE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the absence of EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON I beg to ask the Secretary of State for India the Questions of which my noble friend has given notice&#x2014;namely:<lb/>
When he proposes to introduce the Government of India Bill, dealing with the transfer of the capital of India to Delhi, and cognate matters.<lb/>
Whether it was the case, as announced in <i>The Times</i> of 7th February, that the Law Officers of the Crown had come to the conclusion that for the creation of a Governorship for the Presidency of Bengal it is inadvisable to rely upon the Charter Act of 1853; and, further, that under the entirely altered circumstances of to-day it is inexpedient to base this important change upon an Act passed sixty years ago when the East India Company was still in power.<lb/>
Whether, as announced in <i>The Times</i> of 20th March, it has now been determined to proceed to the Bengal changes by means of Executive notification; and, if so, what is the reason for the change of attitude, and whether the Law Officers of the Crown have changed their opinion.<lb/>
By what means it is proposed to provide for the creation of Executive Councils for Bengal and for Behar and Orissa; and<lb/>
With what subject the Government of India Bill may be expected to deal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01350"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must first express my regret at the absence of the noble Earl who put these Questions on the Paper, and at its cause. I trust that it will not be long before he is here in his usual activity again. I will answer the Questions in the order in which they stand. I think, in view of various circumstances, it will not be convenient to the House that the Government of India Bill dealing with the transfer of the capital and other matters should be introduced before Easter, but I propose to introduce it as soon after Easter as possible.<lb/>
In the second and third Questions the noble Earl asks, on the authority of <i>The Times,</i> whether the Law Officers of the Crown had come to a certain conclusion in regard to the creation of a Governorship,
<col>642</col>
and whether the Law Officers of the Crown had changed their opinion later, with a resulting change of attitude on the part of His Majesty's Government. In reply, I have to say that I know nothing whatever of the circumstances alleged in the Questions to have occurred. So far as I know there is no foundation for the statement that there has been any change of attitude on the part of His Majesty's Government. We always intended to proceed with the changes by way of declaration so far as they could properly be so proceeded with. As a matter of fact, the declaration of the Secretary of State in Council and the proclamation setting up the new Provinces were published in India on the 23rd inst., although, for some reason which I do not exactly understand, the announcement of that publication does not appear to have been made in the London Press.<lb/>
Then the noble Earl asks by what means we propose to provide for the creation of Executive Councils for Bengal and for Behar and Orissa, The Bengal Council exists already under the two Acts of 1833 and 1853, and the members of the Council have already been appointed. The Council for Behar and Orissa will be brought into being by a clause in the Bill about to be introduced.<lb/>
In his last Question the noble Earl asks with what subject the Bill may be expected to deal. One clause vests the new Governor of Bengal with the same rights, duties, functions and immunities as are now enjoyed by the Governors of Bombay and Madras. For instance, without statutory sanction such as this Bill will give the new Governor of Bengal would not be able to act as Governor-General in the absence or incapacity of the Viceroy. It is obviously right that he should be placed in a similar position in that respect and in certain other minor respects as the Governors of the two other Presidencies. Another clause of the Bill enables Legislative Councils to be established in Provinces administered by Chief Commissioners, the effect of that being, as regards Assam, that this new Province, which has already enjoyed the benefit as part of Eastern Bengal and Assam of a Legislative Council, will not lose that privilege, but will retain it. Then there are a certain number of consequential repeals and certain savings which have to be made, and this, I think, exhausts the list of subjects with which the Bill will deal.</membercontribution></p>

The Bill has already been twice before your Lordships, and is in precisely the same form in which it passed your Lordships' House last year. The class of people to whom it refers are very much outside our social laws and even our education laws, and although considerable powers have been given of dealing with them from an educational point of view, I am sorry to say that the working of those powers is in practice very inefficient. This Bill is of a very limited scope. Clause 1 gives to county councils power to prohibit encampment on certain grounds for sanitary reasons. Clause 2 gives power to the county council, with the approval of the Local Government Board, to provide camps in various parts of the county. The Local Government Board and the county council are to take into consideration the general interests of the public and the ability of occupiers to comply with the regulations which are made, and when this is done they have power to forbid encampment on certain land and on private ground where the owner objects, and the police have power to remove those who, in defiance of the published regulations, persist in camping on the ground. There is a clause for the protection of showmen, whose interests should be taken into consideration. The

<col>649</col>
sanitary authority are asked to assist the county council by giving information and otherwise helping them in carrying out the regulations which are made. There are the usual monetary provisions and provisions saving the rights of the naval and military authorities, and there are the usual definitions. I believe that the Home Office still hold the objection which they urged in your Lordships' House before as to the duty placed on constables to remove persons who have broken the by-laws made by the county council, but all these matters will come up when the Bill is considered in Committee, and therefore I will not weary your Lord ships by referring to them further at this stage. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01386"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ALLENDALE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as Lord Clifford has reminded you, this Bill has been before your Lordships' House for three or four years. Last year it was reintroduced in an amended form as recommended by the Select Committee to whom your Lordships referred the Bill in 1910. Lord Clifford has reminded your Lordships of the main provisions of the Bill, and therefore I do not propose going into them. In fact, the Bill has been before your Lordships' House so often that it is unnecessary for me to do so. The Local Government Board and the other Government Departments concerned have endeavoured to amend the Bill and to put it into a workable shape to meet the grievance which exists in regard to gypsies and van dwellers. It is a distinct grievance in certain parts, but only in limited counties and localities. The question seems to be really one for local authorities to deal with; but how far county councils will take advantage of the Bill, especially in view of some considerable expense which may be involved, is another matter. As Lord Clifford mentioned, the Home Office raise an objection to the provision which your Lordships inserted in the Bill last year, imposing on the police, under Clause 2, the new duty of removing from commons and private lands persons who encamp there without authority, and I understand that the Chief Constable of Surrey, the county where I believe this grievance is most acute, says he will not be able to undertake this work with the present force at his disposal. I understand that my noble friend Lord Ashby St. Ledgers, who represents the
<col>650</col>
Home Office in your Lordships' House, will move an Amendment to this particular part of the Bill when we get into Committee. At the present stage, however, the Government have no wish whatever to oppose the Bill, but are quite prepared to support it, subject to any Amendments that may be considered necessary.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01393"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this Bill comes before your Lordships' House in special circumstances which make it desirable that I should say a few words on the general subject before proceeding to deal with the actual provisions of the Bill itself. As your Lordships all know, for the last month the country has been passing through a period of profound anxiety, not altogether unaccompanied by actual suffering. The concern which Governments are now expected to take in trade disputes of this kind has become a new feature in the last few years, and it is a feature which throws a special and extra burden upon any Government that may happen to be in power. In this particular case it seemed to be assumed from the first that the Government ought to take some step or another towards a settlement of the dispute; and although this was assumed, at the same time there was, both on one side and on the other, both among the employers and among
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0351"/>
<col>651</col>
the men, a distinct feeling of suspicion against what either might term undue Government interference.<lb/>
I do not think it necessary that I should trace in any detail the occurrences of the last month. Those occurrences in their main outline are quite familiar to your Lordships from the ordinary sources of information; but it has become clear to all, even to those to whom it might not have been clear at first, that a general coal strike, even if it be not entirely unique in its effects on the country, yet stands in an entirely different class from the ordinary trade disputes with which we have been in the past familiar. The loss brought about by most strikes may be exceedingly severe, they may mean the complete paralysis of a particular branch of industry, but there are few strikes&#x2014;although, as I have said, the coal trade is not absolutely unique in this respect&#x2014;which could affect the whole life of the nation in the way in which it is affected by a general strike in the coal trade. Consequently at an early stage His Majesty's Government thought it right to do what it could towards composing the difference between the employers and the men, and during the whole of this period the Prime Minister and three of his colleagues have worked early and late, altogether unsparing of their time and trouble, being at the same time deeply and indeed fully concerned with other matters of moment which they set aside, in their attempt to compose this difference; and I think it may be claimed for my right hon. friends that they have held a fair and even balance between the two parties to the dispute throughout the whole of this discussion. That, I believe, has been fully recognised by both sides, by the owners not less than by the men. When the negotiations unhappily came to an end both sides, I am informed, paid an unstinted tribute not only to the hard work which my right hon. friends had undertaken, but also to the spirit of fairness and impartiality which they had displayed.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, it was never the object of His Majesty's Government to engage in legislation on this subject; altogether the contrary. If we could have avoided the bringing in of a Bill we certainly should have done so. Neither was legislation the object of either party to the dispute. It was not, I am confident, the desire of the coal owners, and noble Lords who have studied the debates in another place will
<col>652</col>
have observed that the miners' representatives in the House of Commons, those who are most entitled to speak for the men have consistently throughout the debates expressed their objection to the settlement of this dispute by legislation rather than by agreement between the two parties | involved. But in view of the fact, the generally agreed fact, that this strike, owing to its national character, could not be permitted, as some strikes might be, to wear itself out by the exhaustion of one side or the other; in view of that fact legislation became necessary, owing to two circumstances. In the first place, there were some owners&#x2014;a minority&#x2014;who refused altogether to admit the principle of the minimum wage, the principle for which the men by their ballot had decided to ask. In the second place, the men on their side refused to submit to discussion the particular schedule of minima fixed in certain districts selected by themselves, the minima also being fixed by the men and not the outcome of discussion. In our view those two circumstances made legislation imperative, and in framing this legislation His Majesty's Government have, as I venture to claim, followed the path of moderate opinion, and throughout all the discussions that have taken place during the progress of the Bill they have never swerved: from that path.<lb/>
I am aware that various complaints have been brought against His Majesty's Government, quite apart from any objections which may be felt to the particular provisions of this measure. One complaint that has been made is that His Majesty's Government did not act soon enough, that they ought to have foreseen the situation before it developed and have introduced, and, I suppose, carried, some kind of legislation&#x2014;I do not know what&#x2014;in consideration of what might possibly occur. It seems to me that there are few cases, if any, in which hypothetical legislation offers a desirable path to follow. It was impossible to foresee at any given point during the negotiations what the precise course of those negotiations might be, and if anybody now asserts that all along he knew that such and such would be the precise outcome of the negotiations I should take leave to consider that he is deceiving himself.<lb/>
Complaint has also been made in some quarters that we did not rush at once into legislation of a drastic and violent kind
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0352"/>
<col>653</col>
founded upon various legislation which obtains either in New South Wales, in Victoria, in Western Australia, or in New Zealand. Those complaints have been lightheartedly made, but it is difficult to hear them without asking since when have you taken the industrial conditions of those great Dominions as models for our industrial conditions here? Those States and Dominions are well qualified to manage their own affairs, but I venture to assert without fear of contradiction that, if we are going to adopt here plans and methods which are entirely to revolutionise the relations of Capital and Labour in order to bring those relations into the condition in which they are in the Dominions and States I have mentioned, that ought to be done of set purpose and with the utmost forethought and deliberation, and not undertaken in a moment of panic at a crisis.<lb/>
Some people, I believe, have asserted that we ought to have taken strong measures. My Lords, I do not know precisely what is the ground or the substance of that complaint; it is common knowledge to us all that you cannot by force drive men to work any more than you can drive employers to offer work; therefore,, when strong measures are spoken of I confess I do not know exactly what is intended. If it is merely intended to suggest that protection ought to be given to those who desire to work, certainty His Majesty's Government have not refused and will not refuse any request for such protection. The circumstances and conditions under which such protection has to be given and the circumstances in which it may properly be asked are quite familiar to all your Lordships. No such request made in the authorised manner has been received.<lb/>
It may also be asked. Why, if you are going to legislate at all&#x2014;why make a minimum wage the subject of your legislation? The answer to that is the simple one that in this dispute the minimum wage is the sole subject in question. If you go further and ask why it is that the miners as a body ask for a minimum wage, that opens up a field of inquiry&#x2014;an interesting field of inquiry&#x2014;upon which His Majesty's Government as such are not bound to give an opinion. We may be told that the one precedent which exists in our legislation for a minimum
<col>654</col>
wage&#x2014;namely, that formed by the Trades Boards Act of 1909&#x2014;does not supply in itself a complete reason why the miners should ask for a minimum wage. In a sense, of course, that is quite true. The particular trades scheduled in the Trades Boards Act are trades of an entirely different character from coal mining. They include such trades as cheap tailoring, the making of chip boxes, the making of machine lace, and the special case of the chain-makers at Cradley Heath&#x2014;labour which, as many of your Lordships I dare say know, is carried on largely by women. And it is asked, Why does the coal industry, which is different in character from these and is a highly-paid industry, desire a minimum wage? The origin of this request from the miners for a minimum wage was undoubtedly the discussion which arose in some districts, though by no means all, in relation to what are known as abnormal places&#x2014;that is to say, places at the face of the coal at which a piece worker, though he may put as much labour into his day's work as the man who is earning a large, wage per day, finds, owing to the fact that from the defective formation of the place he is working or to some other kindred cause, that a great deal of what he has got by his work is not coal, and therefore he does not earn the full day's wage for his work. And then there are other cases, also more prevalent in certain districts than in others, in which a man after having got his full allowance of coal for the day and having therefore, as he thinks, earned the full wage of piece work which a man could gain in a day, is unable to fill the proper amount of coal&#x2014;that is to say, to place it in the tub or on the trolley in which it is taken to the pit bottom&#x2014;and therefore again fails to earn the full remuneration for his day's work.<lb/>
These difficulties were first matters of local dispute, but they became the subject of a national conference and consequently the subject of a national demand from the miners generally. It is no doubt true that the miners, having only in comparatively recent times worked on national lines as distinct from local lines in relation to their trade, were not sorry to find a subject such as this which could appropriately become the subject of a national demand. They also, no doubt, thought, although it is a point which some would be inclined to dispute, that the allocation of minimum rates of wages in different
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0353"/>
<col>655</col>
districts would have a steadying effect upon wages generally and might prevent some higher wages from falling. It is only, I think, natural that the men, having now federated themselves together into a national body, should have felt sympathy for those in particular districts who were subjected to the hard cases which I have mentioned in relation to abnormal places and want of facilities, and that therefore, even though not personally affected by the establishment of a minimum wage, they were glad to join in the request. When this request for a minimum wage became the subject of a general demand it was accepted, though it was not welcomed or desired, by the owners in the federated area, which comprises, as your Lordships know, a large and important and also a very prosperous portion of the English coal field. If this dispute, therefore, had been localised, as up to a few years ago disputes in the coal trade always were, so far as the federated area is concerned it would have been settled without difficulty between the masters and men without any question of interference by Parliament.<lb/>
This Bill is in itself of not at all a complicated character. It states that it is to be an implied term in the contract of every man working underground that he is entitled to a minimum wage, and that minimum wage is recoverable civilly by the workman in the ordinary manner. But the House will observe that no penalties are attached either way, either to employers or to men, in any part of this Bill. In order to get at a reasonable figure for the minimum wage the country is divided up into numerous districts which your Lordships will find in the schedule of the Bill, and in each of those districts a joint board is to sit composed of employers and workmen, with a neutral chairman chosen, if possible, by the two parties, or, in default of that, by the Board of Trade, and there is a provision which allows the office of chairman to be divided up among three representatives acting jointly. The duty of these joint boards is to settle the minimum rate for the district. It is also their duty to settle rules which will embody what have been called in the course of these discussions "safeguards" for the owners. Safeguards are required for this reason&#x2014;that if an employer is to pay a minimum wage it is reasonable that he on his side should be allowed to demand
<col>656</col>
that an amount of work representing that minimum wage should be done by the man who receives it.<lb/>
It has sometimes been suggested that the establishment of a minimum wage would lead to a great deal of malingering amongst miners. That, in my judgment, is an altogether exaggerated fear. I do not think it is a fear which has been so widely held by the owners themselves as by some who have spoken and written in their supposed interests. There are two reasons, to my mind, which make this an exaggerated fear. In the first place, it has always been the habit of miners when they have not desired to work hard not to work at all, and a habit of that kind becomes ingrained and is not easily eradicated. With one possible exception the miners' trade is the only one so far as I know in which a man goes to work when he likes and when he does not wish to work stays away. Therefore any habit of slacking, or still more of anything that can be described as malingering, is in itself foreign to the habits and ways of miners. But there is a further reason which I think makes the fear an exaggerated one dependent on the character of the work itself. The face of the coal&#x2014;as many of your Lordships know who have been down a coal mine&#x2014;is not an appropriate place at which to lounge. When a man is at work of that kind he is practically certain to work hard. He has not got the temptation to slacken in his work which might affect, say, an agricultural labourer working in pleasant surroundings, or the workers at some trades of a more sedentary character. Consequently I venture to think that these fears are greatly exaggerated. But at the same time it is distinctly contemplated that rules will be made which will prevent any black sheep, if such there be, earning the minimum wage without doing a fair proportion of work.<lb/>
Provision is made in the Bill for possible revision of the minima at a future time, and it is provided that from the passing of the Act these minima shall became payable to the workers. That, as I think your Lordships will see, has this advantage, that it offers a definite inducement to the men to return to work immediately after the passing of the Act rather than to wait until the district boards are formed and have named a minima in the respective districts. We regard this as a distinctly
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0354"/>
<col>657</col>
valuable provision in view of our hopes that work will shortly be resumed. It has been argued, I believe, that there are a few cases in which the initial cost of opening a mine after this stoppage might be so considerable if the minima had to be paid from the day of opening that the owners would prefer the course in such an event of not opening at all. If such cases exist they must be exceedingly rare, and if they do exist I cannot imagine that there would be any difficulty, in such a rare case, of the employers and workers coming to an agreement for special terms during the short period necessary for re-opening, because we have to remember&#x2014;and it is a matter which always ought to be borne in mind in considering this unhappy trade dispute&#x2014;that throughout it all, at any rate in most districts, the relations between the mine owners and the men have remained uniformly of a friendly character.<lb/>
In another place various Amendments were moved, in the first place, there were Amendments of great substance and importance moved on behalf of the miners. They desired to import into the Bill the schedule which I have mentioned. They claim that that schedule, although they had fixed it themselves, ought not to be regarded as their schedule, because it did not represent their demands but represents the very least that they thought they ought to get. It may be the case when the boards come to examine the figures that as regards some districts that will prove to be the case, but we do not know that it will be the case everywhere. In any case Parliament has no knowledge which would enable it to assert either "Yes" or "No" to such a question of figures. Then it was demanded that if that could not be done at any rate a minimum rate of 5<i>s</i>. for day workers and 2<i>s</i>. for boys ought to be incorporated in the Bill. Both those Amendments were firmly resisted by His Majesty's Government, not merely on the ground that it was not possible for Parliament to possess the requisite knowledge to fix figures of that kind, but also because there is a most marked and distinct difference between setting up a body, as is proposed by this Bill, to arbitrate after discussion on the figure of the wage and the actual and deliberate fixing of the figure in an Act of Parliament. We all know there, have been cases in the remote past in which not merely the price of labour but the price of many commodities has been fixed by Act
<col>658</col>
of Parliament, but I say again here, what I have said in relation to the introduction of compulsory arbitration and matters of that kind, that if Parliament is going to undertake a task of that kind it must do so after reflection, after the fullest discussion and after the utmost deliberation, and not in order to meet the need of a moment or in hopes of settling particular and critical disputes.<lb/>
This Bill has come up, it is true, at very short notice. I ventured to ask your Lordships to agree to the suspension of the Standing Order which would permit us, if we so desired, to accelerate its passage and even to take all its stages in one day. If your Lordships would agree to do this it would undoubtedly be because the Bill might pass without substantial amendment. It is clear that if it were to be in any way substantially amended time might be necessary for that purpose; but I trust that your Lordships will not desire to undertake any special responsibility with regard to it by importing any Amendments of substance into the Bill. If your Lordships will agree to proceed this evening with the Committee stage I shall ask for the insertion of three Amendments, none of which is of a substantial character. The only one which can be regarded as having at all a substantial character is inserted in deference to the wishes of the coal owners and in order to remove a fear with regard to a particular phrase in the Bill which has been expressed by them. The Amendments, I believe I am in a position to say, would be accepted by both sides in another place. They have been submitted to both parties and are not objected to, and I do not think they would give rise to any discussion there. But at the same time your Lordships may ask why there should be any particular hurry in proceeding with the Bill to-day, when, after all, it has not reached this House at as early a date as at one time we hoped would be the case. We are anxious that it should become law as soon as possible, now that it has, as I hope we shall be able to say when it leaves this House, reached a point when, though the principle may be objected to by some and particular details may not be liked by others, yet there is a disposition to regard it as the best that Parliament can do to close this disastrous strike.<lb/>
I am informed that the next step will be when the Bill is passed for a ballot to be taken asking the men whether they are
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0355"/>
<col>659</col>
willing to return to work. That being so, it is surely most desirable that the Bill should pass, because it must not be forgotten that the difficulties all through have been added to by a certain atmosphere of suspicion which has prevailed, not only on one side but on both, as to the respective motives of each side and the motives of His Majesty's Government and of Parliament, and therefore any delay might have, if not a disastrous, at any rate an unfortunate effect upon the taking of the men's opinion. Speaking only for myself, I am hopeful that the result of a question of that kind put to the men after the passing of this Bill, which it must be remembered answers their request&#x2014;namely, for the principle of a minimum wage&#x2014;and answers it in the affirmative (because the other matters which have been mentioned later did not form part of the request made by the men), will be the bringing of the men back to work, and therefore, if the House is willing to allow the Bill to pass without substantial amendment I trust that your Lordships will do so to-day.<lb/>
With regard to the Amendments which I shall have to move when we go into Committee, the only one which I may describe as having any substantial effect is one to Clause 2. page 2, line 36. The later words of subsection (1) of that clause as they are printed read&#x2014;
<quote>"In settling any minimum rate of wages the joint district board shall have regard to the average daily rate of wages paid to the workmen of the class for which the minimum rate is to be settled."</quote>
In the Amendment which I shall move I propose to leave out the words "average daily rate of wages paid to" and to insert "prevailing day wage rate for." The objection which was taken to the first words and which has induced us to alter them was founded on the fact that the average daily rate of wages is not really a term appropriate to coal mining, and it might conceivably be taken to mean something quite different from the intention of the framers of the Bill. It is not intended that you should take all the wages of the district and lump them together and then take a figure halfway up the list. What it does mean is that the prevailing day wage, which is not the same thing by any means as the wage which is paid to a piece worker as his earnings for a day, should be the one to which regard should be had in settling the minimum wage rate. I am told that this change of words satisfies the representatives
<col>660</col>
of the coal owners, and I hope that your Lordships will agree to incorporate it in the Bill.<lb/>
There is one other point which I should like to mention in relation to the latter part of this subsection. It was desired by the coal owners' representatives that, instead of saying that the joint district board shall have regard to the average rate of wages, they should have regard to that "amongst other matters." In our view that is not a substantial Amendment which it would be at all necessary or even advisable to accept. I do not think myself that it makes very great difference whether the words are in or not, but it is one of those cases in which the representatives of the men entertain a suspicion that something more is meant than the words actually express. On the owners' side the suspicion was also held that "having regard to" these wages meant that the same actual rate must necessarily be paid. It is quite clear that such is not the case, because those who have to administer this Act have only to refer to the express declaration of His Majesty's Government in the matter and also to the fact that His Majesty's Government refused to admit an Amendment which was proposed by the men's side&#x2014;namely, that the rate payable should be the daily rate of wages in the district. Consequently I should hope that there is no ground whatever for the fears expressed by the coal owners in this matter.<lb/>
The other two Amendments are of a drafting character. The only one of any length is an Amendment in the definition clause to which I think no exception is taken. Instead of the definition of a "workman" as printed in the Bill, the Amendment which I shall move states that&#x2014;
<quote>"The expression 'workman' means any person employed in a mine below ground, other than &#x2014;
<ol>
<li>"(<i>a</i>) A person so employed occasionally or casually only; or</li>
<li>"(<i>b</i>) a person so employed solely in surveying or measuring; or</li>
<li>"(<i>c</i>) a person so employed as mechanic; or</li>
<li>"(<i>d</i>) the manager or any wider-manager of the mine; or</li>
<li>"(<i>e</i>) any other official of the mine whose position in the mine is recognised by the joint district board as being a position different from that of a workman."</li></ol></quote>
The effect of that is to somewhat narrow the definition of a workman, and as I am given to understand that the representatives of the men do not object to it, it is quite evident that it is not likely to be
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0356"/>
<col>661</col>
objected to on behalf of the owners. I think that is all I have to say with regard to a possible amendment of the Bill, and in consideration of the fact that the Bill is not to receive, so far as I am aware, from any quarter of the House&#x2014;I am able to speak on that point on behalf of those who represent the coal owners&#x2014;any substantial amendment, I hope your Lordships will be willing to proceed with the Committee stage this evening.<lb/>
I entirely decline to assume the possibility of the failure of this Bill. It may not in some respects entirely carry out the desires of the men as stated by those who represent them in Parliament and who moved certain Amendments which His Majesty's Government and the House generally were unable to accept. So far from assuming any kind of failure as to the fate of this Bill, my one desire is to see it made law as soon as possible, because I regard it as an honest attempt to do all that Parliament can, in our opinion, do; and although the powers of Parliament are in one sense unlimited, yet, in another sense, in a matter of this kind there are limits to what Parliament can do to bring about a settlement of this dispute. Speaking for myself, if I may for a moment, I have this matter very much at heart. I have lived all my life in the neighbourhood of collieries and have had a number of excellent friends among the miners and their representatives. Many years ago for more than a year I was a Parliamentary candidate for one of the principal mining constituencies in England, and certainly nothing will ever alter my feeling of respect and affection for the miners as a class. I believe, too, that the miners are universally held in no small regard as a body. With the possible exception of our sailors, I do not believe that there is any class of workers who have obtained so much public sympathy and popularity throughout the country as the coal miners. That, I think, may make us all the more glad that throughout this lamentable dispute there has been a signal and most happy absence of disagreeable and unpleasant features, either in the discussions which have taken place between the different parties or in the places in the country where the trade is carried on, and I hope most fervently that we may be able to say as much until the resumption of work has taken place and the trade is once more being carried on in a regular way. I sincerely trust,
<col>662</col>
too, that the leaders of the men&#x2014;a believe they will&#x2014;will represent to them that this measure, even if it does not contain everything that they have asked for, yet represents the careful and honest attempt of Parliament to meet their wishes so far as they can be met by legislation, and that they will accept the Bill in the form in which it leaves Parliament.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01395"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is one point which I cannot altogether pass over, and upon which I shall say a very few words at the outset of the remarks which I have to offer to the House. I wish to call attention to the remarkable change in the industrial situation which has taken place since this matter formed the subject of a conversation between the noble Marquess opposite and myself across the Table of the House. Upon that occasion His Majesty's Ministers were certainly under the impression that the passage of this Bill would be an immediate signal for the return of the coal miners to their work. His Majesty's Ministers were so much convinced of this that they asked this House to meet on Saturday last and to pass the Bill through, the whole of its stages on that day upon the plea, and only upon the plea, that such a course was necessary in order to bring about the result which they so much desired. Those hopes were destined to be frustrated. The conference has failed: the Bill, so far as I am aware, is not accepted by either of the parties, and, indeed, no one so far as I can make out, except His Majesty's Government and their immediate supporters, has a good word to say for it. But, my Lords, in spite of that the Bill is presented to us by the noble Marquess as being in the view of himself and his colleagues a measure which is indispensable to avert the disasters with which we are threatened; it is, as I understand it, regarded by the noble Marquess as an indispensable element in the policy by which His Majesty's Government will be guided in dealing with the coal strike&#x2014;a policy, remember which, as the noble Marquess has toll us to-night, includes measures of precaution for the purpose of affording protection to all those who desire to do their work in spite of the pressure put upon them by the strikers. In such circumstances I certainly desire to avoid
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0357"/>
<col>663</col>
anything that might bear the appearance of captious criticism. Nothing, however, can relieve us of the duty of commenting upon this Bill and of telling the House and the country what we think of the merits of so momentous a measure.<lb/>
Only last night the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that this Bill was a very remarkable departure in legislation. I think it is; and it, is a very abrupt departure. I may remind your Lordships that a very few weeks ago in the House of Commons an Amendment was moved, the object of which was to press upon the Government the desirability of adopting the principle of the minimum wage. That Amendment was defeated by a majority of something like five to one, and to the best of my belief no Minister was found ready to give it his support. Now, what has happened in the meantime? I may be told that we have become aware that these coal miners have a grievance. I think they have a grievance, and I should be glad to assist in meeting it. But let us be under no illusion. It is not the grievance of the coal miners which has converted His Majesty's Government to the view which they at present hold. That is not the real motive power behind this Bill. What has effected the conversion of His Majesty's Government is the appearance of a colossal conspiracy which has held up the country and which has seized upon the grievance of the miners as a convenient pretext for insisting upon the views which that conspiracy advocates. The noble Marquess was evidently conscious of the fact when he spoke, for he told us a moment ago that he had no doubt that the miners and their leaders were not sorry to find a subject such as this upon which to found their demands. They have founded their demands upon it because they are aware that coal is, as the Prime Minister said the other day, the lifeblood of this country, and that by throttling the coal industry they can strangle the very life, the very existence, of this great industrial community.<lb/>
I do not know whether even now His Majesty's Government fully realise the extent of the danger which threatens us. We are sometimes told that a strike of this kind produces a condition of things not very different from those which obtain in time of war. But, my Lords, in time of war there is at any rate this con-
<col>664</col>
solation, that the country is solid, that it feels that it is fighting for some great purpose, a purpose for which it is ready to make great sacrifices in the hope that we shall emerge from the struggle stronger and more united than when we entered upon it. This war which is now being I waged upon the country is an internecine I war. Its immediate consequences are the paralysis and the ruin of our trade, together with widespread suffering felt most acutely amongst the humblest classes of the community. It is a struggle from which the nation can only emerge weakened and humiliated. I say nothing of the remoter consequences. They are simply incalculable. Our trade, much of which is carried on on a very narrow margin of profit, may be driven away from these shores never to return, never to find its old channels again. Already, if your Lordships watch what is reported in the public Press, you will see that our foreign competitors are beginning to divide the spoils which we are to lose. When, therefore, His Majesty's Government come to the House and tell us that in this Bill they present us with a remedy for this disease I for one certainly say, Let us do what we can as far as our consciences will permit in endeavouring to help them. But we are bound to count the cost.<lb/>
The noble Marquess said something of the reluctance with which the Government of which he is a member determined to intervene in this struggle, and he added that both parties, both the miners and the coal owners, looked with suspicion upon Government intervention. That suspicion is on the whole a natural feeling, and one which is shared by most people in this country. There are many reasons which render it desirable to avoid Government intervention. I will mention only two of them. In the first place, there is in this country, and I believe in most countries, a considerable body of public opinion slow to move but profoundly intolerant of the tyranny either of Capital or of Labour. That body of opinion gathers force in the face of events like these, and will, I believe, in the end make itself felt irresistibly, in spite of any combination which can be brought against it. To my mind one of the misfortunes of Government intervention is this, that it tends to discourage that body of public opinion from acting with the vigour and spontaneity which it might otherwise exhibit. When they see
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0358"/>
<col>665</col>
you buying off&#x2014;because that is the only expression which meets the case&#x2014;when they see you buying off the assailants of the country by means of concession of this kind these people are certainly discouraged from exhibiting the activity which they probably would exhibit in different circumstances.<lb/>
There is a second reason which leads me to look askance upon the intervention of the Government. Governments are very apt to attempt things which they are not able to accomplish; and in a case of this kind, although it is very easy to interfere with the operation of economic laws, I believe it is impossible for any Government in the long run to suspend the operation of those laws. Every attempt of the kind is apt to produce results very different from those anticipated by the persons who demand interference. I am old fashioned enough to believe that all attempts to fix the price of labour and the price of commodities are apt in the long run to prove disappointing to those who make the attempt. You can in this instance compel the owners of coal mines to pay a minimum wage, but you cannot compel them to keep their mines open. Many of those mines, there is every reason to know, are worked at a very small profit. Many of those which do show apparently a very large margin of profit are worked under conditions, which, if a considerable percentage were to be added to the colossal sums which they pay in the remuneration of labour, would wipe out those profits, large as they are.<lb/>
And, my Lords, do not let us forget that if labour can strike, capital can strike also, and with not less deadly effect. What happens in a case of that kind? Fewer pits remain open, coal becomes dearer, an inevitable rise in the price of all the necessities of life follows, with the result that suffering and privation extend to the whole community. How will the account stand&#x2014;if you can make up an account at the end&#x2014;when you set upon one side of it that vast and universal suffering and upon the other the comparatively small increase in wages obtained by the comparatively small number of miners whose grievances we are considering to-night? While I say this, I admit that it would have required great courage on the part of His Majesty's Government if they had declined altogether to intervene in this dispute, and
<col>666</col>
I certainly would not judge, them hardly for having attempted to mediate between the parties. In their conduct of those most difficult negotiations I find something to admire and some-thing to deplore. I admin;, if I may be permitted to say so, the great patience and equanimity exhibited by the Prime Minister and his colleagues under very trying circumstances during the long days of these discussions. I also admire the steadfastness with which they refused to accept proposals which would have had the effect of inserting into this Bill a fixed money limit for the minimum wage of men and boys. I admire these traits. On the other hand, I regret that it was not announced more distinctly at the outset of these discussions that His Majesty's Government were prepared to extend the fullest measure of protection to all those who had the courage to stand out against the pressure which was put upon them by the trade unions. I also regret that something was not said a little more, definitely in condemnation of the manner in which solemn agreements entered into with the approval and even with the participation of His Majesty's Government, have been torn up by those who have struck in some parts of the country.<lb/>
I desire, however, to remind the House that His Majesty's Government undertook mediation and something more. They made it plain that in the event of the failure of their efforts they were prepared to resort to coercion. That was intimated in unambiguous terms which I need not trouble the House by quoting. This Bill, then, is the fulfilment of the pledge that coercion would be applied.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01396"><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: What coercion?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01397"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: The Bill contains the elements of coercion in a most obvious form. The mine owners are to be compelled to accept a minimum wage, and cannot employ a man except upon those terms. Surely that is coercion, and I apply to that policy of coercion the test which I think should be applied to any measure of coercion applied under similar circumstances by any Government. I think three questions should be asked with regard to it. First, is your coercion even-handed? Secondly, is it likely to be effectual? Thirdly, are the
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0359"/>
<col>667</col>
consequences, the remoter consequences, likely to be in any sense embarrassing to you? I am constrained to say that in my belief a satisfactory answer cannot be given to any one of those three questions.<lb/>
In the first place, let me point out that the coercion&#x2014;I am afraid that I must adhere to the term&#x2014;which is to be applied is to be applied in a sense very different from that which, as far as we could understand, was originally contemplated by His Majesty's Ministers. I am sure the House carries in its mind the four famous propositions of the Prime Minister. The first of them was to the effect that there were cases where men were unable to earn adequate wages from causes not within their own control, and the second was to the effect that in such cases adequate wages should be secured to the men. That was the substance of the two propositions. When this matter first came under discussion what the Government had in their mind, and what all of us who considered the matter had in our minds, was the question of what the noble Marquess described as "abnormal places." Abnormal places were the loading case, and the arguments were all of them based on the grievance of the miners as to these abnormal places. And remember that so long as you limited your proposals to these abnormal places you had a frontier to defend, because the existence of abnormal places differentiates the coal industry, so far as I am aware, from all other industries with which we are familiar. And remember, too, that upon that point the owners were from the first ready to meet the men in a spirit of reasonable accommodation.<lb/>
As I understand this Bill, we have drifted far from the question of abnormal places and those kindred cases upon which the noble Marquess touched in his speech&#x2014; I mean the cases where the men are hardly used owing to a shortage of tubs, and so forth. This Bill, as I read it, gives a minimum wage to men who are already liberally paid, and who do their work under conditions which seem to me indistinguishable from the conditions under which men employed in other industries perform their allotted task. I think His Majesty's Government are aware; that they have drifted away from their old frontier and have entangled themselves in a very much more far-reaching and dangerous policy. Let me read to your
<col>668</col>
Lordships what was said by the Prime Minister on the 5th of this month. It had been suggested that he had given a pledge under which the minimum wage was to be given to all industries. He repudiated with warmth the suggestion that he and his colleagues regarded the grant of the minimum wage in the coal industry as the first step to the attainment; by some form of compulsion of a minimum; wage in all the industries of the country. He repudiated the idea that he had been engaged in what he called a "sly flirtation of this kind with Socialism." He pointed out that the coal industry had peculiar, and, indeed, unique features, and it was those peculiar and unique features which, he said, justified and even necessitated on the part of the Government an intervention which otherwise would have been wholly unwarranted. He ended&#x2014;
<quote>"To suppose, when that was the main drift and gist of the argument I was addressing to the men, that, I put in a plea that this was going to be the first step towards the application to other industries in which those conditions did not obtain of any such method of treatment is entirely to ignore the foundations of the case I addressed to them."</quote>
Let me compare with that what was said a fortnight later by the Foreign Secretary in the House of Commons. Sir Edward Grey used these words&#x2014;
<quote>"It is possible that Parliament will have to meet other demands from other trades. A door has been opened with regard to the minimum wage which cannot be closed. Parliament will have to face the question. It is no use attempting to hide our head in the sand."</quote>
Well, my Lords, I think that is a very clear admission that the original position taken up by His Majesty's Government has been abandoned, and that a position much more dangerous and much more compromising has been adopted in its stead.<lb/>
The noble Marquess said a few words upon the question of safeguards, and I have something to say upon them also. I am speaking now of the safeguards which are intended to protect the coal owners against fraud and abuse, and not of those larger safeguards, about which there is also something to be said, which are necessary to protect society from the kind of pressure to which it is being at present subjected. Throughout the whole of these discussions the question of the minimum wage and the safeguards to be given to the employer have been indissolubly linked together. The safeguards are, so to speak,
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0360"/>
<col>669</col>
the complement of the minimum wage. What has happened to those safeguards? They have been relegated to the rules and regulations which are to be set up by the district hoards under the Bill. These boards are left entirely without guidance as to the safeguards which are to be adopted. That, I believe, represents what His Majesty's Government regard as a desirable characteristic of elasticity in this Bill. In other parts of the Bill they are not content with that elasticity. For example, they have put in an Amendment&#x2014;an Amendment which [understand the noble Marquess intends to amend again this evening&#x2014;obliging the boards, in fixing the minimum wage, to have regard to certain conditions which are known to prevail in regard to the coal industry. In that case the boards are not Heft without guidance. They are given distinct guidance and distinct information as to the direction in which they are to look. Contrast for a moment the position of the coal owner and the position of the coal miner in regard to these safeguards. The rate is laid down by the board; it thereupon becomes obligatory upon the coal owner. The miner has a right to claim it; if it is refused to him he gets his remedy in the nearest Court of Law. The owner of the pit must pay the wages and go on paying them or close his pit. But when it comes to the master, when the master desires to obtain the security that in return for a fair wage there should be a fair equivalent in labour, he has great difficulties indeed to contend with. The burden of proof rests upon him. How is he to prove that there is a case against the individual miner who in point of regularity or efficiency fails to produce the proper output of coal?<lb/>
The Prime Minister described the conditions. "The work," he said, "is done in darkness, and the kind of supervision exercised when work is done in the light of day is manifestly and necessarily absent. "Of course it is. I ask, How is it possible for the coal owner to prove his case? Or, at any rate, if he is to prove it, what an immense burden of proof you are throwing upon him. That is not all. Suppose the coal owner decides to reopen his pit&#x2014;the rate is fixed, and the coal owner becomes liable for it; but is there anything to prevent the whole of his men from laying down their tools and leaving him in the lurch, perhaps without any
<col>670</col>
notice whatever, and in spite of any contracts to the contrary My Lords, I venture to think that on all those points: the dice are heavily loaded against the owners and in favour of the men, and it seems to me all the more creditable to the mine owners that they should have; met His Majesty's Government in the extremely reasonable spirit which they have exhibited throughout these negotiations.<lb/>
What, then, are we going to get out of i this Bill? The noble Marquess thinks the: men will go back to work, and I think they probably will. A good many of them are going back to work already, not because of the comfort that, they derive from this Bill but because a great many of them are gradually beginning to realise that they have been grievously misled by their leaders and were going to have the courage of their opinions and resume work at the mines. But let us assume that the men will go back to work a little sooner in consequence of this Bill than they might otherwise have done, what kind of a bargain is this for the nation? The Prime Minister talked the other day about finality. Is there any finality in this Bill? It is only to run for three years, and are you very sanguine that during those three years peace and goodwill will reign? I own that the prospect fills me with dismay. It seems to me that one of two things is likely to happen. These boards may fix a high minimum wage with a low standard of efficiency. If that happens immense sums will have to be paid for unperformed work, and a burden will be laid upon the industry greater than the industry can bear. If, on the other hand, you have a low minimum wage and a high standard of efficiency, then there can be no doubt that we shall witness a constant recurrence of these; disputes, followed by all the deplorable consequences which have attended this dispute, and you will have new strikes organised by the same unscrupulous methods which have prevailed upon this occasion. I am afraid that the one emerging fact which comes out of all this is that the Bill leaves it in; the power of the leaders of the men whenever they please, to pass sentence of starvation and ruin upon this country, to humiliate us, and to paralyse us, perhaps at the very moment when the country stands most in need of all the strength that it can put forth.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0361"/>
<col>671</col>
Now, my Lords, what is our duty in reference to this measure? It is recommended to us by His Majesty's Government as the only way out of the difficulty which confronts us, and the Government that recommends it commands a docile majority in the House of Commons. We are, then, in this position: we cannot impose, we are powerless to impose, another policy upon His Majesty's Government; we are equally powerless to impose another Government upon the country. In these circumstances it does seem to me that any effort of ours to alter this Bill can only embarrass the responsible Government of the day and tend to prolong a period of anxiety which we desire should be as short as may be. I venture to think that in these circumstances your Lordships will do well to regard this measure as really an executive act for which His Majesty's Government, and His Majesty's Government alone, are responsible. I listened carefully to the noble Marquess's plea when towards the end of his speech he gave us the reasons for which, in his view, this Bill is one of urgent necessity. I think he told us that the men were likely to take a ballot at a very early time; that in view of that ballot it would be much better that this Bill should become law at once, and that any delay seemed to him dangerous. My Lords, to that plea I for one am ready to bow, and so far as we are concerned&#x2014;those who sit around me&#x2014;we shall not move Amendments to the Bill nor shall we attempt to delay its passage. But we must ask permission to place on record our doubts as to the wisdom and the justice of the measure.<lb/>
I am afraid I must add that I for one am profoundly incredulous of its merits as a real solution of the immense problem which you have to solve. I think even Ministers themselves do not fail to see that the Bill affords no solution of that problem. I trust I shall be forgiven if once again I quote pregnant words used lately by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister said&#x2014;
<quote>"The State by this Bill steps; in, and with the State, after this Bill has become an Act of Parliament, both interests will have to reckon. We are asking Parliament here to make a legislative declaration of the principle of a statutory minimum wage. After Parliament has taken such action the position is no longer what it was before. As I have said, we hope and believe it will bean effective Bill, and that at any rate is all we ask Parliament to do for the moment, and Parliament will be
<col>672</col>
fortified in taking that action if&#x2014;which Heaven forbid&#x2014;we should be compelled to take other and different measures to defend against paralysis and starvation the industries of the people of this country."</quote>
Those are solemn and significant words, and they cannot have been lightly used. The Prime Minister says he hopes that Heaven will forbid the necessity and that he will escape the painful necessity of other legislation of a different kind. He may possibly trust to his own lucky star for enabling him to himself escape responsibility for such legislation; but, my Lords, I entirely disbelieve that the country will escape. I believe this Bill carries with it a Nemesis of its own, and that from that Nemesis there is no escape.<lb/>
Depend upon it the coal strike of 1912 and the passage of this measure will mark an epoch in the industrial history of this country. We are learning, and I think most of us have learnt already this tremendous lesson, that we are no longer concerned with disputes and strikes of the old type, affecting limited areas, special interests, and local questions. Capital and Labour no longer compete as they did, freely in the open market. We have to face a vast organisation covering the whole surface of the country, an organisation which effaces personal liberty and obliterates the independence of the trade unions. Under that organisation the units of the labour army, ruled with an iron discipline, deriving no shelter from the so-called secret ballot under which their decisions are taken, are hustled and hurried into warfare, ruinous to themselves and ruinous to the whole of the people of this country. We are not thinking in these days of the interests of capitalists or of the pockets of shareholders. It is a question of the freedom and independence of the whole community. I hope His Majesty's Ministers will still carry in their minds what was said at the time of the railway strike by one of their own colleagues&#x2014;I refer to the First Lord of the Admiralty&#x2014;in regard to the duty of the Government of the day. Mr. Churchill said&#x2014;
<quote>"A stoppage of the railways would produce unemployment followed by absolute starvation. Railways must run, and any Government which exists in this country must be responsible for making them run in the ultimate event."</quote>
Surely the coal supply of this country is every whit as indispensable to us as the supply of railway communication. And
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0362"/>
<col>673</col>
let me say this, that the obligation of His Majesty's Government is doubled by the fact that they are going to pass this Bill. If you are here to see that the labour of these coal miners is adequately paid, surely you are also here to see, not only that their employers obtain an adequate return, but that the country obtains an adequate performance of the service which is due to it. That is a question which you will have to face, and I trust that you will take advantage of the truce which we hope will now begin in order to examine these questions courageously, and, as the noble Marquess suggested, deliberately, and I hope, in spite of what the noble Marquess said, that you will pay some attention to the manner in which these problems are dealt with, not only by foreign countries, but by our own great Dominions beyond the seas, and I trust that the result of these investigations will be that when the next crisis arises you will not again be taken unawares.<lb/>
One word more only before I sit down. I earnestly trust that those who hold the kind of views which I have endeavoured to express will not have it imputed to them that they are wanting in sympathy with the wage-earning classes of the country. We look with no jealous eye upon the demands of these men for more leisure, brighter and more attractive surroundings, a healthier life, and all the various things which increased remuneration spells for the working man. We have taught him to look for these things, and it is reasonable that he should look for them. May I go further and say that, although I do not live in a coal-mining region, I share with the noble Marquess the feeling of sympathy which he so well expressed with coal miners as a class. Their work is done under very unattractive conditions, in the midst of darkness, in foul air and in cramped positions. We cannot be surprised that they should look for ampler remuneration and for opportunities of providing themselves with some compensation for the hardness of their lot. And let me add this, that I shall never speak or think of coal miners without calling to mind the manner in which, sometimes in circumstances of almost inconceivable horror when some great calamity overtakes their fellow workmen, they show themselves capable of the highest heroism which an Englishman can exhibit.<lb/>
<col>674</col>
Nor, my Lords, have we any hostility to, nor do we look with any eye of suspicion upon, trade unions as such. We recognise that such combinations are indispensable in our society; that they form an essential element in our social system; that without their existence there could be no stability of relations between Capital and Labour, and that it is necessary that Labour should be organised and its representatives clothed with adequate authority. And, my Lords, may we not add to that that in our dealings with the trade unions we have been as good as our word, and that we have given them ungrudgingly with both hands almost everything for which they have asked. I go further. I do not think it would be untrue to say that the trade unions are the spoilt children of the Statute-book. I need not recall to your Lordships the series of Acts culminating in the Trades Disputes Act of 1906, under which we gave privileges and immunities of the most extensive character to the unions, under which we protected their funds, under which we protected their actions, and under which we gave them immunity for conduct which, committed by any other members of the community, would bring t hem within the purview of the law.<lb/>
It is not unreasonable, in face of the circumstances which confront us to-day, that we should ask whether the whole of those immunities are entirely appropriate to the new conditions which have arisen in this country. I have no time to labour the point. I will give only one illustration. I take what is known as "peaceful picketing." What is the essence of peaceful picketing? Of course, that it should be peaceful. How are you going to secure that it is peaceful? Only by the supervision of some one. But who is going to supervise this process of peaceful picketing at a time when, for all you know, every constable and perhaps every soldier in the country may have his hands full in preserving law and order? I give that only as an illustration. I think it is not unreasonable to say that the concession of these great privileges carries with it a twofold obligation&#x2014;an obligation on the Government to see that these privileges are not abused, and an obligation on the persons who possess them to use them in a moderate and reasonable spirit. There was a time when, I believe, the leaders of the trade unions would have done
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0363"/>
<col>675</col>
their utmost to see that a moderate and reasonable spirit was observed. I regret to say that, so far as I can judge, the unions are now passing under the control of men whose opinions are notorious and whose advice is not at all likely to conduce to moderation and reasonableness. They are men who are publicly committed to the doctrine that Capital and Labour have nothing in common, that agreements should be refused and may be repudiated, and that a member of a union owes a duty to his union which comes before the duty which he owes his country as a citizen.<lb/>
My Lords, those are lamentable doctrines, and, to my mind, the most deplorable of all is that under which the men are enjoined not to respect the sanctity of contracts. I will tell your Lordships why I feel that so strongly. To me it seems that, in the midst of all the gloom which now hangs over this question, there is one ray, and almost only one ray, of hope, and that is the hope which we discern in the movement for what is commonly spoken of as "profit-sharing." I have been told that profit-sharing could not easily be adopted in the case of the coal trade. But, nevertheless, I am sanguine enough to believe that in any industry it should not be beyond our ingenuity to devise some means of establishing an alliance between Capital and Labour, of infusing those who work with their hands with what I might call the spirit of partnership&#x2014;of giving them some kind of interest in the success of the enterprise in which they are engaged. Those who are teaching the men to have nothing to do with contracts, and to regard them as engagements which may be broked lightheartedly, are doing the greatest disservice to the country, because they are driving into a remoter and receding background the advent of that more hopeful system and of those more hopeful terms which so many of us desire to see introduced as between employers and employed.<lb/>
I have said all that I desire to say. I earnestly hope that this Bill, as the noble Marquess anticipates, will give us a breathing space. I hope His Majesty's Government will use that breathing space in order to set the industrial house in order. The work is one in which to my mind both parties might
<col>676</col>
well co-operate, and if it were to be done thoroughly and courageously, then it may come to pass that some good will be derived by the country from this lame Bill and from the deplorable events which have led His Majesty's Government to pass it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01398"><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I rise to make a few brief comments on the speech to which we have just listened it is not because I have any complaint to make of the broad conclusion at which the noble Marquess has arrived. He has said truly that the responsibility for this Bill must rest with His Majesty's Government and with the Government alone, and I may say that we are grateful to him for the indication that he will put no difficulty in our way in the discharge of this most serious responsibility. I do not think it is possible to over-estimate the seriousness of the situation in which we stand. One of the great and vital industries of the country, one of the two or three industries on which the national life depends, is threatened internally, and it becomes the duty of the Government of the day to use every means in its power to put matters into order. You cannot compel 850,000 men to go down to work, nor can you put compulsion upon Capital. If you endeavour to interfere capital will not flow into the industry, and if the flow of capital ceases then you are in another difficulty from the other side. What, then, is the policy of this Bill? And here I come to a point at which I do not share the views of the noble Marquess. He spoke with gloom of the Bill and of the future. I noticed&#x2014;and it is one of the points on which we take some encouragement&#x2014;that although he made some critical observations, as he was well entitled i to do, upon the adequacy of this measure in so great an emergency, he did not suggest any counter policy, and I do not think any counter policy can easily be suggested in this case. I believe myself, and we submit to the House, that the plan we propose is the most hopeful plan under the circumstances. We have recognised, on the one hand, that there were grievances. Perhaps they arose, as the noble Marquess said, originally out of minor questions of abnormal places which might have been at the time dealt with in such a fashion that the controversy might have been confined within limits,
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0364"/>
<col>677</col>
but there has arisen a broad question between the employers and employed in an industry which is vital to the country and which calls for the intervention of the State.<lb/>
The noble Marquess spoke in very gloomy terms of the future and of the spirit that had arisen. He spoke of a great conspiracy, and said this Bill might be looked upon as little better than an attempt to buy that conspiracy off. That is not my view of the attitude of the miners of this country. The miners are a body of men quite as good as if no better than their neighbours. They take the same broad sane views of things, and one looks to them as being moved by what is the foundation of all government in this country, what is the only basis on which we rest, and that is the common sense and good will which characterises the community as a whole. It is to that that you ultimately come back. It is to-day, as it has always been, the very foundation of democracy&#x2014;it is the very basis on which we proceed. If it were wanting, or if there came any change, then the whole machinery of Government tumbles to pieces. I ask your Lordships, Is there any indication that people are different to-day from what they have always been? If you look at the quietness and sanity with which this proceeding has been carried on, the miners putting their point of view and the owners putting theirs, and realise that there has been a total absence of turbulence and violence and a determination to argue both sides of the question in a reasonable manner, I think you will agree that the same sanity and good sense which has proved a sufficient foundation for us in the past is there for us to act upon to-day. If that be the case, the policy of this Bill is a very simple one. It is not an attempt to buy off a conspiracy, but an attempt to get at the truth between two contending bodies on the very important point, the principle of the minimum wage.<lb/>
I agree with the noble Marquess that all efforts to interfere with the natural bargaining of people among themselves are bad. I agree that it would have been infinitely better if we could have avoided this Bill, as also many other Bills. I wish we could have avoided the Factory Act, and the legislation, which both sides have undertaken, interfering with land in
<col>678</col>
Ireland, but interfering because it was necessary so to interfere in the interests of the common weal. I wish we could have interfered less than we have done in other matters which have become common cases in the last few years. But every now and then it has become evident that you must take a step in the direction of interference in the public interest, and to-day we have just such a case after every effort has been made, after the Prime Minister and my colleagues who have been associated with him had, as the noble Marquess very justly said, spared no pains to bring the parties to a common point of view. That turned out to be impossible. Disaster has ensued, there has been a stoppage of a vital industry, and the result has been this Bill. Our policy is to hold the scales equally between the parties.<lb/>
The noble Marquess spoke of coercion. I do not know that coercion is quite the best phrase that can be used. It is certainly interference with liberty of contract in this matter. It is coercion in that sense, and in that sense only. It is interference to that extent, and the interference takes place, not for the purpose of fixing wages, but for the purpose of establishing the principle that in the coal industry there should be a minimum below which no men should work, because it is held that if they did it will give rise to a worse evil, and you will have a danger of a recurrence of the evil which we are suffering to so great an extent at the present moment. Therefore the Bill establishing that principle endeavours to work it out with as much elasticity as possible. There are these boards to be formed representing the employers and the men, coming together under a chairman appointed by themselves, or, if not, by the Government, and the chairman has the casting voice. I think the noble Marquess did not quite do justice to the very great elasticity which is left in the way of imposing condition. If you look at subsection (2) of Clause I of the Bill you will see that the rules which are to be made by the joint district board make provision for the exclusion from the minimum rate of those who are incapable through age or illness, and also impose conditions as to the regularity and efficiency of the work. I quite agree you cannot define these things precisely in a measure of this kind. All you can do is to get an impartial
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0365"/>
<col>679</col>
arbitrator and put into his hands the duty of dealing with the case. That is the utmost that can be done, and that is what has been done. Therefore I think the noble Marquess a little under-estimated the provisions in this Bill which have been framed with great care having regard to that question of elasticity.<lb/>
The principle of the Bill is what I have stated. It is an attempt to lay down a policy as to the principle of the minimum wage which is fair between the two parties. The Bill when it becomes an Act will be presented to the miners and to the coal owners alike as our offer to them after doing our best to get at the truth of what is right and just. To the extent to which contracts are interfered with there will be for the future compulsion in these matters. We believe that the Bill is a just one. We believed that it was better to take the simple principle of the minimum wage rather than to attempt to interfere by fixing wages in the Bill. We think that there is in the Bill enough to solve the situation which has arisen. And when I am asked. "What guarantee have you that the Bill will achieve its purpose?" my answer is the answer I have already given that we believe that to-day, as in times past, among the miners and among the public there prevails a desire for order, a good sense about these matters, and a desire for freedom from those agitating ideas&#x2014;of which I think the noble Marquess has made too much&#x2014;freedom from such ideas as Syndicalism, freedom from such ideas as tend to upset the relations between Capital and Labour, but a desire to have justice done to themselves and to those with whom they are dealing. With the conviction that that spirit is as great and as good in the community as it ever was we believe that when this Bill becomes law public opinion will enforce its acceptance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01399"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HYLTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to say a few words on this matter. Living as I do and have done for years in a colliery district I have naturally been brought a great deal into touch with mining matters, and I am sure that everything that has been said by the noble Marquess the Leader of the House and by the noble Marquess on this side as to the good qualities of individual miners would be endorsed by everybody living in my neighbourhood acquainted with the
<col>680</col>
miners. But what we have to consider this evening is not the good qualities of individual miners but the effect of that combination or that conspiracy&#x2014; and I do not think the noble Marquess who leads this side of the House used a word which was a bit too strong when he spoke of a conspiracy&#x2014;on the part of the leaders of the miners' union to bring about this disastrous strike. The miners themselves are, I am convinced, as law abiding a section of the community as any other class, and they are just as ready to obey the law if they see that those who have to administer the law are willing and able to carry it out. We all know&#x2014;or if we do not we can very easily ascertain it&#x2014; that there are thousands of miners in this country who had no wish to go out on strike at all, who had no grievance at all, and who are willing and anxious to go back to work either to-day or to-morrow or at the earliest possible moment if they had the protection of the law. The reason they are prevented from doing so is that, owing to the state of the law as regards the protection given to trade unions, they are afraid to go back to work until the permission of their trade union is given to them. The so-called ballot is of the most inefficacious character possible. The secrecy of the ballot as regards these cases that are voted on by the miners' union is universally acknowledged by all who know anything about the subject to be of no value whatever.<lb/>
I do not propose to occupy your Lordships' time this evening by discussing the causes of this unfortunate national strike, but I cannot refrain from saying, and I think many people will agree with me, that modern trade unionism has much to answer for to the workers of this country. If I had to quote any specific instance in support of that assertion I would quote the instance of the ruin of the great ship building industry on the Thames that has been brought about directly by trade unionism. But what we are anxious to do at this moment on both sides of the House is not to discuss the causes that have brought about the present disastrous state of affairs, but rather to seek as speedily and as peaceably as possible something that will bring the strike to a close. I am certain I am voicing the opinion of every one on these Benches when I say that there is not one of us who wishes to make the least Party capital out of the crisis that has arisen,
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0366"/>
<col>681</col>
and I believe that every one, or nearly every one, who sits on these, Benches would gladly concur in the tribute to the Prime Minister that was made by Lord Lansdowne for the patience and perseverance with which he endeavoured to bring the negotiations between the masters and the men to a successful close.<lb/>
But, my Lords, the question that we have to ask ourselves this evening is, Will; this Bill by itself bring about, or is it likely or calculated to bring about, a cessation of the strike and of the crisis that has arisen? I personally have very little hope that the passage of this Bill&#x2014;because it is not going to be opposed on our side, I understand&#x2014;will have that effect. Many of us remember various legislative measures that have been passed by Parliament within the last few years interfering between employers and employed and regulating the relations between masters and men. Many of your Lordships will remember the debates that took place in this House when the Eight Hours Bill came to us from another place, and I think many of us will remember the particularly powerful speech which was made by Lord Durham on that occasion speaking in opposition to the Bill. Every one of the predictions that were made by Lord Durham in regard to that particular measure of legislative interference between the masters and the men has been absolutely and entirely justified.<lb/>
When I say that, it is not that I venture to put forward my own opinion. I should like to quote a sentence from a speech that was made in another place last night in the discussion on the Bill that is now before us. Mr. Brace, formerly a miner, I think, himself, and one of the representatives of the Labour Party, in the course of his speech in another place last night used these remarkable words, that since the passing of the Eight Hours Act the men had not been able to earn such good wages; and he was followed in the debate by Lord Castlereagh, who, speaking of course from a different point of view, absolutely corroborated what Mr. Brace stated. Lord Castlereagh urged upon the House of Commons that one of the principal causes in his opinion of this strike was the unrest and disquiet that had been caused and the loss of wages to the men by the Eight Hours Act. There is one example before your eyes of Parliament interfering between masters and men and endeavouring
<col>682</col>
to regulate their relations. It is not, I think, one of very happy augury for success attending the measure that is now before us. So much for the Eight Hours Act. Then, of course, we all have good cause to remember the Trades Disputes Act and the introduction of that system of so-called "peaceful picketing"&#x2014;though the adjective "peaceful" in the opinion of any one acquainted with the system is not a very appropriate one. He would be a sanguine man who considers that any measure like the Trades Disputes Act is one which we should do well to follow. I think many of us on this side of the House and a great many other people in the country have had bitter cause to regret that the Trades Disputes Act ever became law.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, turn your attention for a moment to the long series of Acts that have been passed in the last few years in respect to land and the relations between landlords and tenants in this country. In nearly every one of those Acts you will find that the principle of freedom of contract is infringed upon or abrogated, and I hardly think that any member of His Majesty's Government could quote any one of those Acts as having given increased content or comfort to any of the classes interested. Those Acts are all Acts, as I say, which abrogated the principle of freedom of contract between employer and employed. And now we have brought before us the latest phase of legislative interference between masters and men. I think the noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, in the remarks he offered to the House just now, took an almost apologetic line for the Bill that has been brought in. It appeared to me that he had very little to say in favour of it. In answer to questions that the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, addressed to him, asking him where was the protection and where were the safeguards for the employers. Lord Haldane could do nothing but point to subsection (2) of Clause I where district rules which have not been made or framed or discussed are the only safeguards that are offered to the employer in this matter. Of course, we are not going to divide on this side of the House against the Minimum Wage Bill; and I will only remark that in my humble opinion perhaps the only satisfactory feature in this Bill is that contained in Clause 6, where it is stated that if the Bill becomes an
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0367"/>
<col>683</col>
Act it is to have a very temporary character and to be in force for three years only. But, my Lords, I should like humbly to urge upon His Majesty's Government that the passage of this Bill, even if it is quite unopposed on this side of the House, will not and cannot bring peace to this country unless it is accompanied by something more. I should like to implore His Majesty's Government to realise that no legislative effort of this kind can be of any real effect in settling the industrial unrest that has been sweeping over this country within the last few years unless it is accompanied by firm and impartial administration of the laws that are at present in force in all three kingdoms. I mean by that, not only that the law shall be enforced, but that the ministers of the law, from the Judges of the High Court down to justices of the peace, ought to be protected and upheld in such decisions as they think fit to give, and that the law in future shall once more become a terror to evildoers, including even trade unionists if they are proved to violate it. I say this in no vindictive spirit whatever. I urge it not on behalf of individuals or of a class, but I contend that it is in the interests of the nation that this shall be carried out. We have seen, I regret to say, in the last few years signs that His Majesty's Government, not only in England, but in Scotland and Ireland too, are not willing to allow the law to be enforced in a proper way. Judges and magistrates have been personally attacked by Ministers, their decisions reversed, and I am perfectly certain that neither this Bill nor any other Bill of a similar character that is passed by Parliament can have any real and lasting effect in putting a stop to the industrial unrest and disturbance that is so unhappy a feature of the present day unless it is accompanied by a a firmer administration of the law than His Majesty's Ministers can be said to? have exercised in the last few years. Speaking on another subject a few evenings ago I remember that my noble friend Lord Dunmore pointed out to the House that His Majesty's Ministers have been unusually active during the last few years in bringing legislative measures before, the Houses of Parliament, but they seem to sometimes forget that there is a far more really important function that ought to be exercised by His Majesty's Ministers and that is the proper administration of the Government of this kingdom.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01400"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have always noticed that your Lordships give indulgence to any one who speaks with practical knowledge and interest on any topic that is before the House, and it is only because I myself am closely connected, as have been my father and grandfather before me, with the working of coal in the county of Durham that at the present moment I rise to trespass on your Lordships' indulgence for a few moments. I seldom agree with the noble Marquess who leads the House, but to-day I cordially agree with all he said as to the character of the miners engaged in the coal trade; and I was indeed glad to hear the observations of my noble friend behind me, who not only endorsed the statement of Lord Crewe but went even further and spoke of the great gallantry frequently shown by the miners in cases of emergency and danger. My Lords, I can endorse every word my noble friend said. I myself have been unfortunate enough to be the witness of a great colliery explosion. In my county, as in others, there have been cases in which men have been saved by their comrades in individual instances, and I can say with truth that there are many men in the Army who have earned the Victoria Cross, and justly deserved it, who have not shown more gallantry than have those pitmen in rescuing with almost reckless courage their fellow comrades in the hour of danger.<lb/>
Although I am going to put forward perhaps the case of the owners, I hope I look with impartiality on the whole question. I recognise that these gallant men have a perfect right to look after their interests, and I am sure they would condemn me and think very little of me if I had not the courage to look after my own. I say at once that these men who occupy the position described by my noble friend behind me in a profession in which there is undoubtedly very hard work and great jeopardy have a right to expect and to demand the highest wages that the industry can afford. I do not think that any pitmen in the county of Durham will deny that their wages are fair and that they are not grudged by the owners. The average wage in the county of Durham for hewers is 6<i>s</i>. 10&#x00BD;<i>d</i>. per day, and in addition the men get house accommodation and coal. Of course, when I say that that is the average there
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0368"/>
<col>685</col>
are cases in which the sum paid is very much higher, and there are cases which I shall indicate shortly in which naturally the wages are lower. In the great majority of collieries in Durham the hewers work for seven hours on an average or less from hank to bank, and I do not think in those circumstances that it can be said that the owners stint their <i>employ&#x00E9;s</i> with regard to the question of wages.<lb/>
But, my Lords, we have to look to the economic side of the question and to consider what the industry can bear in proportion to the amount of wage which it is in a position to pay. There is no better judge of the coal trade than the noble Lord, Lord Joicey. I wish he were here to-day, because he could give a far better view of the question than I can; but the noble Lord in a letter to <i>The Times</i> a short time ago used these words&#x2014;
<quote>"Wages on the average take 60 to 70 per cent. of the amount realised for coal at the pit's mouth&#x2014;that is, out of every &#x00A3;1 realised wages get from 12,<i>s.</i> to 14<i>s.</i>; the remaining 6<i>s.</i> to 8<i>s.</i> being left to pay all other charges in the way of machinery, materials, rents, rates, taxes, claims for subsidence, and many other costs, and interest upon capital."</quote>
I think your Lordships will allow that that is a very heavy percentage on an industry to pay for wages only, leaving all the other calls to be met out of what remains.<lb/>
If we take the history of the coal trade for the last twenty or thirty years we find that burdens of an increasing character have frequently been put upon that trade by legislation. I take first of all the Act of 1897, the amending Act of that Act, and the Eight Hours Act which was alluded to by my noble friend behind me and which has done such undoubted damage to the coal trade, and to which I to a great extent attribute the present unfortunate condition of affairs; then I take this Minimum Wage Bill which I presume we are shortly to have forced upon us; and we must look forward. I take it, to the fact that in a few months' time the Insurance Act will come into operation&#x2014;all of these putting an extra charge upon the coal trade and adding most materially to the cost of production. To what does this lead? Those of us who have studied the question of the coal trade know well that there are many collieries in which there is a very small
<col>686</col>
margin between profit and loss, and if these additions are put on to the already very heavy cost of production, there can only be one result, and that is that these collieries must be closed down. To make a colliery work at a profit there must be a certain output per man. But there is no safeguard in this Bill that I can see that there is to be any regular output for each individual man in that part of the colliery in which he has to do his work. It is therefore extremely difficult to tell what effect this minimum wage will have on output generally.<lb/>
In regard to the county of Durham, it is not correct to say that the effect of a minimum wage is absolutely unknown. In that county there is a colliery&#x2014;I would rather not give the name of it&#x2014;where the minimum wage is in operation, and where the miners' wages are made up to the county average. It should be noted that in this minimum-wage colliery there is a loss in the working, while another colliery working the same seam shows a profit and a larger output although it employs a smaller number of men. From that we are justified, I think, in gathering that the effect of the minimum wage ill this colliery shows a smaller output of coal with more men than in the other colliery to which I allude. If the minimum wage is going to reduce the output, you must also remember that there are other collieries in which the seams are very thin and in which it is impossible for a man perhaps to work more than three tons of coal a day, with the result that the output of that colliery being so small there can be no profit and consequently it would not be worth the while of the owners to keep it in work. The agitation which is the origin of the bringing about of this minimum wage arose from the fact that certain men working in collieries, owing to no fault of their own but to conditions over which they had no control, had not the opportunity of making the same wages by working the same amount of coal as they would have done under more fortunate conditions. I use that expression because I think the word "abnormal" is not altogether a satisfactory word in describing it. But, my Lords, this Bill has gone very far beyond that. It is not a question now of a minimum wage for abnormal places, but a question of a minimum wage for every man who goes down the pit and is in the employment of that pit.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0369"/>
<col>687</col>
If only the question of abnormal places was in dispute, this Bill is really not needed in the county of Durham, for in that county the principle has long been recognised in practice, and the wages of men working in abnormal places have, subject to certain conditions and restrictions, been made up by an allowance usually called "consideration" which increased the wages according to the circumstances of each case, so that machinery closely approximating to that proposed by the Government Bill exists in the county of Durham, and by means of it the men and the owners can submit any grievance to a joint committee composed of owners and miners who are empowered to settle, and, failing agreement, the matter is referred to a mutually elected tribunal which settles with the men without friction and without Government interference. I consider, therefore, that there was no need whatever for the strike in the county of Durham, and I believe if the miners there were free agents they would be very glad to return to their work, because they have not struck for the reason that they do not receive good wages. I think I have shown that their wages are exceptionally high. But, my Lords, this Bill, as far as I gather, gives no guarantee whatever that the men will go back. And let me bring this to your Lordships' notice. Even supposing the men did wish to go back, it is very doubtful whether some employers of labour would be in a position to reopen their pits, although the men wished to go down and work them, because at the present moment, with this minimum wage hanging over their heads, they do not know what their liability will be. It might be that they will find that the district rules will make them liable for a minimum which, in a colliery with hardly any profit whatever, would turn that little profit into a loss; and that, in addition to the insurance cost which will come upon them in a few months, will very likely make it unprofitable to open the colliery at all.<lb/>
A question was raised in the House of Commons&#x2014;I do not know that it was discussed at any great length&#x2014;as to the retrospective character of this Bill, if I can use the expression, by which the men were to commence receiving the minimum wage from the moment they went down the pit. To people who have studied the coal trade and who have had experience
<col>688</col>
of strikes it is well known that when the men first go down the pits after having had a cessation of work for several weeks they are not in such good physical condition to do the work as they were in when they were fully employed. Their muscles are relaxed, their hands are soft, and for the first week or two they probably would not be able to do enough work to bring in the minimum wage. The owner is therefore having a heavy fine inflicted upon him if he is to pay the minimum wage when the men do not produce coal sufficient even to produce the minimum wage. I think that is a matter which ought to have been considered in the House of Commons, because it does put a very heavy penalty on the owner if the minimum wage is to commence from the day the men go down, instead of commencing after they have been down a fortnight.<lb/>
The condition of the miners has not been, to my mind, sufficient to bring about this strike, and we ought to ask ourselves what is the reason of this general unrest which has culminated in the strike which is bringing such disaster and misery to so many thousands of the people of this country. I do not hesitate to say that I think that this unfortunate condition of affairs is due to a very large extent to the speeches made by members of His Majesty's Government. The speeches of Mr. Lloyd George especially were based on the principle of setting class against class, Labour against Capital, employed against employer; and now those speeches are coming home to roost. The result of those speeches has been to drive capital out of the country, and not only to drive it out of the country but the policy of the Government as such has been to prevent capital being sunk in the country, as it has been for generations past, in order to develop the resources the country enjoys. Without capital what would our country have been? It is private enterprise and private capital that has developed our mines, our shipyards, our mills, our telegraphs, our railways&#x2014;all that is due to private capital. But will capital be sunk in the future in this country in developing resources if the capitalist knows full well that if his venture turns out a success he will be taxed out of existence by the Chancellor of the Exchequer? I venture to say it will not. If I may give your Lordships an experience of my own, I can tell you that for ten years
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0370"/>
<col>689</col>
I invested annually a very large sum of money in sinking a colliery. That, as your Lordships are aware, is a very expensive and a somewhat hazardous undertaking, but I think now that if I could have foreseen some years ago what would take place I should not have invested that money, but would have invested it abroad in some of those undertakings which it would not have been possible for the Chancellor of the Exchequer to rob. And surely that will be the experience of others who have invested their capital. Not only would there have been less coal worked if I had followed that line, not only would all these men who are now working the pits have been unemployed, but also the vast army of men who have been engaged in building the houses, the chapels, the churches, the schools, and all the other buildings which are necessary in connection with the mines. Therefore I say that the driving of capital oat of this country must be most injurious to the industries of the country.<lb/>
I should like to bring to your Lordships' notice a speech which I think is very relevant in this debate. It was a speech made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. When I read that speech in the papers, I immediately answered it by a letter to <i>The Times</i>, and I shall venture, if your Lordships will allow me, to quote a few sentences from my letter, which I think describes the gross inaccuracies&#x2014;they were nothing else&#x2014;which the Chancellor of the Exchequer was guilty of in the speech he made. My letter runs&#x2014;
<quote>"I have read with some surprise Mr. Lloyd George's description of a visit to a coal mine. He speaks of 'the earth straining around us and above us as if to crush us in.' His experience, I think, trust be unique, for having lived amongst those fully qualified as to all the details of working coal for the best part of my life, I have never heard of any one experiencing the conditions experienced by Mr. Lloyd George. Such conditions do not prevail in the North. Then he talks of ' the pit props Lout and twisted and sundered until you saw their fibres splitting.' Mr. Lloyd George seems entirely to ignore the fact that every possible precaution is taken to ensure as far as possible the safety of all working in coal mines. Certificated managers are appointed, and the mines are under the supervision of Government inspectors and sub-inspectors. The workmen have also the right to avail themselves of having the colliery inspected by their own inspectors. I venture to think in the interests of the coal-owners, apart from humanity, everything is done to secure the safety of the workmen. This is the case in the County of Durham, and I should have imagined but for Mr. Lloyd George's experience that it is the case in all coal mining districts."</quote>
<col>690</col>
To that statement Mr. Lloyd George never offered any answer. What was the purpose of his speech? It was to set employed against employers. It was of a very unfair character and of a most inaccurate description. But do you think that the miners of the present day have forgotten that speech? Do you think the Socialist Party have not remembered it? When you see that the Prime Minister and the leading members of the Government do not repudiate a statement such as that by one of their leading colleagues, do you suppose that the country as a whole does not think that the Government is in favour of Socialism, and that the Socialist Party have the Government at their back? That, I venture to think, is the reason of the present unrest, of the strike on the railways in August last, and of the present disastrous condition of affairs under which we live; and unless His Majesty's Government dissociate themselves from the Socialism propounded by some of their colleagues we are confident that these strikes are only the preliminary to a series of others. This supposition is a very serious one, but I do think that His Majesty's Government are greatly to blame. They are in a position of difficulty, of course, but if they had insisted upon repudiating the statements of their colleagues, and taken a totally different line, I am sure that this disastrous state of affairs would never have grown up.<lb/>
The six years that this Government have been in power have done great harm to this country. I was only reading the other day a sentence by Lord Beaconsfield which, I think, expresses entirely the policy of the present Government during the past six years. Lord Beaconsfield in 1873 said&#x2014;
<quote>"For nearly five years the present Ministers have harassed every trade, worried every profession, and assailed or menaced every class, institution, and species of property in the country. All this they call a policy, and seem quite proud of it; but the country has, I think, made up its mind to close this career of plundering and blundering."</quote>
The words of Lord Beaconsfield then are, I think, applicable now, and I believe that history will repeat itself and that the time is not far distant when the same fate that attended Mr. Gladstone's Government will attend that of Mr. Asquith.</membercontribution></p>

I do so with a knowledge of the kindness that all novices receive at your Lordships' hands, coupled with the fact, which is my only brief for speaking to-night, that I have had a certain amount of personal experience of mining. I do not wish to go into a biography of my life; I simply state the fact that for two years I worked underground as an ordinary miner, as a timber-man, in various capacities in the United States of America. Subsequent to that I worked in various capacities as a mining engineer in most of our Colonies.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, I must say I am entirely against this Minimum Wage Bill. If the minimum wage applied solely to metalliferous mines, I would say that I believed it was fair, because in dealing with metalliferous mines the product of which is gold or silver you are dealing with a product that commands a standard price. In dealing with coal, however, you are dealing with something quite different, and on that ground I am entirely against the minimum wage. If you grant the minimum wage as applied to coal mines, I consider that it is setting up a very dangerous precedent. If you set up a minimum wage for coal mines the natural corollary would be that owners should fix a minimum sale price, but this is impossible, as foreign competition has to be met not only as regards our exports but as regards our manu-

factures. The manufacturers in their turn have to compete against goods of foreign manufacture, and that to my mind is the gist of the whole question of the minimum wage with regard to coal. It is not a standard product, and so I cannot see how you can apply a minimum wage to it.<lb/>
I should feel that I was not paying a tribute to the memory of old times when I worked shoulder to shoulder with miners if I did not tell you that I have many friends amongst them and have great sympathy for them, and I would also say, as has been said in another place, not only by the Premier but by the Leader of the Opposition, and it has been said again in this place, that Schedule No. 1, I think it is, in the demands made by the miners taken by itself is a fair and just demand. That is to say, I consider that 5<i>s.</i> for adults and 2<i>s.</i> for boys is not an unreasonable demand for any one who goes underground. I am so entirely against this Bill that I think I should be wasting the time of the House if I were to try at this moment to show certain alternatives that might arise. But, my Lords, if I pay, in poor language, a tribute to the men&#x2014;and I do not wish to make a gallery speech or to indulge in mawkish sentiment&#x2014;I must also say I cannot pay the same tribute to their leaders. I have met a great many so-called labour leaders, walking delegates at the mine, and while I have found some very good men amongst them I have also found bad ones. I have found that as a rule the bad ones&#x2014;the hot-heads I might call them&#x2014;very often sweep away the discretion of those who have more moderate ideas.<lb/>
When I was in British Columbia I remember once the unions got very tyrannical. I was second in charge of a mine then, and I asked our mine captain to get me the names of the leaders of that section of the Miners' Union, and it did not as a matter of fact come as a surprise to me when I found that in the list of twelve or fourteen men there was not a single miner amongst them. They were the class of men we used to call "tin horns," and "tub thumpers," and it was those men who on Saturday nights were instilling absurd theories into the men. In my time I may say I have been a Socialist, because, as we all know, men's happiness is like the mercury in a thermometer&#x2014;it rises and falls according to
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0372"/>
<col>693</col>
the forces of circumstances. For many years my circumstances were very poor. I came home and found that the only maxim that seemed to count was that there is nothing that succeeds like success. My own friends did not seem to realise that some modicum of success was due to industry. That did not prevail, and, as I have said, I became a Socialist. My form of Socialism was the predatory form, a form which will never maintain. What will maintain is what has made this country great&#x2014;that is individualism. I quite grant that the scope of individualism in these small islands of ours is not as great as in the Colonies, but still we must maintain it, and we must do so by strong government. There is another thing that we must do, and that is we must go more amongst the men. If these theories of Syndicalism and Socialism are not to maintain, as we do not think they can, it is our duty to go and educate the men. I do not think there is sufficient education among the men.<lb/>
I was once a prospector in Australia. I pioneered one of the West Australian districts. By the time I had finished I had not a penny piece to bless myself with, and was obliged to go to the capitalist. The capitalist brings in his money; is started; with milling conic those who cater for the wants of the mining community, and a new industry and community is formed. Socialists do not tell the men that. I am a director of a small coal mine in this country, and yet, though it has great possibilities and has been worked for three or four years, no one has ever got a penny piece out of it. We hear talk of free speech, and talk of the tyranny of the Barons. I say that the tyranny of Socialism is far worse. I will give you an instance. When I was standing for the London County Council some one in the body of the hall challenged me to come and debate Socialism. I said that provided I was elected I would. I went to a friend of mine who was at one time a leader of the Socialist party and asked him if he could get me a fair hearing. He said he would try, but that he did not think he could. If that is the truth, which it is, that is more tyrannical than ever the Barons were in their worst days. But I am wandering from the point and taking up your time, and although I had so much to say, this being my premier effort, I feel that I have not said half. But what I will say is that

I for one will not vote for the Minimum Wage Bill. One result of this Bill will be that after it has been tried for a year it will lead to compulsory arbitration. That is what you have got to face.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01407"><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this Bill which the noble Marquess invites us to pass this evening through all its stages has been passed in the House of Commons by a very large majority. It therefore appears that on the face of it there is a case for its being passed to-day by the House of Lords, but I must say that after listening to the exceedingly powerful speech of the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition it seems that in ordinary circumstances it would be the duty of any Second Chamber to postpone the consideration of a measure of this large character until people had had time to consider it. But these are not ordinary circumstances. I cannot help thinking, when the good time comes when the Parliament Act is repealed, together with the Trades Disputes Act and other measures of an anti-national, anti-social, and sectional character that have been passed by this Government, that then with a strong Second Chamber it would probably be our duty to stay the hand of the Government even in an emergency like this. At the same time I could not gather from the speech of the noble Marquess the Leader of the House any really substantial reason why there is such a cast-iron hurry to pass this Bill into law without further ado. He told us that it was an honest attempt to deal with this crisis; that it might even fail in its object, but that he hopes&#x2014;a hope which he shares in common with a great many other people&#x2014;that work will be immediately resumed. He then told us, and this was Ids strongest appeal, that it was imperative that we should pass this Bill, first of all because a minority of the owners would not come into line with the other owners, and, secondly, because the men insisted on the inclusion of their schedule in the measure.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0373"/>
<col>695</col>
This Bill is in any case an emergency measure. It is either an emergency Act of an executive character, as Lord Lansdowne described it, or it is a legislative Act. If it is an executive Act then it seems to me that the principal excuse for asking Parliament to pass it is that it is going to put a stop to the strike. If it is an executive Act of real value it is not unreasonable to argue that in order for it to be a success the parties most interested should have agreed to it; but it is a little disconcerting to find that, instead of that, the whole of the Labour Party voted against it in the House of Commons last night. It seems exceedingly doubtful, therefore, whether as a remedy to stop the strike it will be successful. At the same time I think it is not unfair to describe this Bill as a legislative Act. There can be no doubt whatever that it is asking Parliament at very short notice to embark upon a legislative project of a very far-reaching and, possibly, of a very dangerous character. I will not weary your Lordships by going at length into the theory or the practice of the minimum wage. I will not argue at length to-night whether it is a good thing or whether it is a had thing. But still, if you are going to ask Parliament in the future to face the idea of a minimum wage, do you not think it will be very much better if we turn our attention in the immediate future to procuring a living wage for the people in sweated industries whose wages really do need regulation by Act of Parliament, and whose condition is so necessitous that there is an absolute crying demand for interference on their behalf on the part of the Legislature? It is no use now entering into academic discussions with regard to the minimum wage. We shall do no good in this country until we recognise the value of the first principles of those elementary rights of citizenship which every successful democratic State has been forced sooner or later to recognise.<lb/>
It is a little difficult to follow the argument which has been put forward in both Houses and in the newspapers, that the coal trade is different from other trades. It is quite possible to argue that the coal trade supplies the life blood of the nation and to follow out that line, but it is not too much to say that when you look into the principles of justice and freedom the coal trade is just the same as any other trade; and if it were regulated and made
<col>696</col>
susceptible by Parliament to those underlying principles, then I venture to say that we should not have so much difficulty with the coal trade or any other vital trade as a lot of people seem to think we shall. But it will be of no avail to attempt to settle this question on broad national lines now or at any other time unless what the First Lord of the Admiralty calls "the elementary rights of citizenship" are first of all safeguarded by public opinion, and, if necessary, by Act of Parliament. The First Lord of the Admiralty has shown a very great regard for the elementary rights of citizenship&#x2014;I am grateful to him for having taught us that word. When he wanted to make a speech at Belfast the other day in vindication of what he called the "elementary rights of citizenship" the whole of the armed forces of the Crown in Ireland were summoned to Belfast to enable him to make that speech. We will not say whether he was right or wrong in so zealously guarding himself on that occasion, but if that is to be done in the case of Cabinet Ministers when they wish to make speeches the same right must be open to all citizens, no matter how humble they may be, when they wish to avail themselves of the elementary rights of citizenship.<lb/>
I have no hesitation in saying that in a very large degree the whole of this trouble is the direct result of six years of Radical Government in this country. The Government cannot avoid their responsibilities in this matter. The state of unrest which we find in the labour world to-clay could only have thriven successfully in the atmosphere of class hatred which the noble Lord opposite and his friends have either countenanced or else deliberately created in order that they might overthrow the House of Lords. Another fruitful hot-bed of the kind of thing that we find to-day is the abuse of representative government which finally culminated in Parliament passing a law to deliberately place, for the first time in the history of this country, a certain set of citizens above the law of the land. We well remember the debates that took place in both Houses when the Trades Disputes Act was under discussion. There was a time before Radical Cabinet Ministers capitulated to pressure on their own side when they were as much against that famous clause in the Trades Disputes Act dealing with tortious acts on the part of trade unions as were the leaders of the Unionist
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0374"/>
<col>697</col>
Party, and we shall not easily forget the quotation which the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, read in this House on the Trades Disputes Bill taken from a speech of the Radical Attorney-General&#x2014;I think it was Sir Joseph Walton&#x2014;in which he implored the House of Commons "not to create a privilege for the proletariat." That sounds like a nasty Tory utterance, but it is not; it is an utterance by one of your own friends in the House of Commons before that clause was placed in the Trades Disputes Act, and it was the creating of that "privilege for the proletariat"&#x2014;a phrase which had it been used by a Tory speaker we should never have heard the last of in the Radical Press&#x2014;which is very largely responsible for the state of affairs in which we find ourselves to-day.<lb/>
There has been a good deal of talk in the House of Commons and elsewhere about "keeping the ring." The noble Marquess who leads the House told us that the Prime Minister had endeavoured to hold a fair and even balance between masters and men in this matter. I leave no doubt whatever that he tried to do so, fighting with the weapons that he had at his command, but it is quite impossible to keep the ring and to hold a fair and even balance between masters and men when one side to the dispute is amenable to the law of the land and the other side has been deliberately placed above the law by Parliament itself. It is impossible to see fair play and justice all round under conditions of that kind. We have been told this afternoon that it might be impossible to end this strike by means of any legislative Act, but it must be apparent to a great many of us that the executive power wielded by any Government, even though they were not under the necessity of meeting Parliament and getting an Act passed, would probably go a very long way towards securing justice in this matter.<lb/>
The noble Marquess in charge of the Bill said that a certain section of the community had been pressing the Prime Minister to do two or three things. One was to legislate earlier in the dispute. Another, with which I will try to deal in a few words, was that he should have afforded at the beginning of the struggle protection to those working men who desired to continue their work. Although
<col>698</col>
the noble Marquess gave us some good grounds for thinking that in the last resort the Government would not shrink from protecting the willing worker, I must say that I should like to have heard him proclaim that in terms which were a little more decisive. He said that during the whole of this struggle, which has now lasted four weeks or more, the Government had not refused to offer protection to anybody who asked for it. I do not think, and the public will not think, that that is a particularly courageous statement on the part of a Minister who is responsible for wielding the Executive. The noble Marquess further went on to say that the Government will not refuse in the future to give protection to anybody provided it is asked for in the authorised manner. I should very much like to hear from the noble and learned Earl who sits on the Woolsack when he speaks what the authorised manner of asking Parliament for protection is. I should have thought, as a humble citizen, that the facts spoke for themselves, and that the time had arrived several days ago in a manner which must be apparent to anybody who has studied the terrible state of things that is going on in this country, when the Government would have the support, of all right thinking people in this country had they proclaimed openly that they would give protection to any willing worker.<lb/>
There is another matter in which it is not too much to ask that the Executive might very easily interfere. Throughout the whole of this dispute we have heard quite enough about the miners on the one side and the owners on the other. Do you not think there are a great many miners in this country who would object to being grouped together with the other miners with whom they do not agree? When you talk about the miners it is impossible to express the ideas of the whole of the miners in this country, because they do not all think the same on this matter. A good many of them voted against the strike on the ballot. But what of the ballot? I am not a coal owner or a coal miner myself, but f am informed&#x2014;I shall be very glad to be corrected by noble Lords opposite who know about coal miners if I am wrong&#x2014;that when a ballot is taken with regard to any important subject those who take the ballot, the leaders of the men, have some means of ascertaining, by a badge or something, which way the men
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0375"/>
<col>699</col>
are voting. So much for the secrecy of the ballot, the one thing necessary if the ballot is going to be any use at all for the protection of the liberty of the subject from intimidation and the basic idea of the ballot if it is going to afford any protection. If I am not wrong, then I say it is the duty of the Government to institute a Board of Trade inquiry forthwith into the way in which these ballots are taken and to make absolutely certain that a man can vote without his fellow workman knowing which way he has voted, and in such a way that he shall be protected from intimidation and duress with regard to the manner in which he has expressed his opinions. Those are two ways in which it might be easily possible for the Executive to do a very great deal.<lb/>
But there is another matter upon which it is not necessary to dwell at very great length to-night and which I was indeed glad to hear foreshadowed by the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne&#x2014;namely, the alteration, or the repeal if necessary, of those portions of the Trades Disputes Act which have placed certain classes in this country out of the reach of the law of the land. That is a matter which has not been given very great prominence to in the debates on either side of the House in another place, and we have not heard very much about it to-night in this House. But everybody must feel, especially after the speeches that were made in the House of Commons by Radical Ministers disapproving of that famous clause in the Trades Disputes Act, that the idea of placing one set of citizens above the law can no longer be supported by public opinion and is no longer consonant with the interests of public safety. I believe that in some respects the country will be rather disappointed with the debates in Parliament on this Bill. It is not extravagant to suppose that those who have been reading these debates have been looking for some stronger statements from Ministers and from those who have been opposed to Ministers with regard to taking stronger measures for the protection of law and order, and that we shall not do any good with regard to the settlement of industrial unrest until we affirm the principle of the mobilisation of all the forces, both moral and material, at our command in support of the principles of free labour, of free voting, and of equality before the law.<lb/>
<col>700</col>
The noble Marquess, Lord Crewe, in concluding his speech, testified to the respect and affection that he had for the miners. I do not know whether that respect and affection is exactly reciprocated, but I feel sure that the utterance of the noble Marquess was absolutely genuine. We on our side yield to no one in our respect for the miners, particularly for those miners who would like to go back to work but are prevented by the forces of organisation from earning their daily bread. If there is any affection and sympathy and pity to be extended, I say for one that my heart and feelings go out almost entirely in this matter to those who have got no fire and no food, and that entirely through no fault of their own, and it is from the feeling that perhaps by the hanging up of the Bill the starvation of these unfortunate people may be prolonged that, important and vital as the Bill is, and immense as is the responsibility which we are taking, I shall refrain from asking your Lordships to divide against this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01408"><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall not interpose with more than a sentence or two between your Lordships and the speeches to which you desire specially to listen, but these sentences I should not like on an occasion such as this to leave unsaid. It has been said, and I think it is a matter of common consent, that after this Bill is passed matters will stand in a different position from that in which they have stood before. The Prime Minister has said so, and the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition has said so to-night. The issue has shifted, or rather the question will find itself in a different setting. It seems to me that, considering the extraordinary difficulty of the situation which has prevailed during the last few weeks, our British characteristics about which we care and of which we are proud&#x2014;earnestness, determination, practical force&#x2014;have in no sense been wanting. Each side has, perfectly rightly, put its own case forward, frankly, plainly, effectively, and with honesty. The Government has borne valiantly its share of the common burden. All that is as it should be. We may disagree with the mine owners, we may disagree with the men, we may disagree with the policy which His Majesty's Government has recommended, not as an ideal policy, but as the best thing that can be done in circumstances so difficult. But
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0376"/>
<col>701</col>
none of these, as it seems to me at least, is in any real sense discredited. I venture to say that we have something to be proud of in the part taken by all the parties who have borne their share in this discussion with the temper, the dignity, and the conciliatoriness in many ways which has been by common consent shown all round.<lb/>
But now, my Lords, the issue shifts; the facts are now adequately known; they have been discussed to the very full; nothing is to be gained, as it seems to me, by discussing further the details of these facts. The issue now turns, not upon the facts with which we have grown so familiar in these recent weeks, but upon the tone and temper in which the situation and the facts as they now stand are going to be dealt with outside&#x2014;upon the tone and temper, that is, of the far larger body which has now to deal with the question. At such a moment we in this House are, I think, entitled and even bound to make an appeal to the conscience, I would say to the Christian conscience, of those who are concerned, and to make that appeal on behalf of what I will venture to call the Christian conscience of the nation. We confidently bid them realise that the interests of the community are, after all, supreme, and that that means chiefly at this time the interests of its poorest and weakest members. I do not believe that we shall make that appeal in vain. And of this I am quite sure, that those who respond to that appeal with the considerateness for the interests of others which I believe will mark that response will not find it to be unfruitful of gain or good for themselves in the long run.<lb/>
Last night the debate in another place was prolonged until an hour which made any public record of what was said extraordinarily difficult, but if I am not wrongly informed there was last night a declaration, repeated not by one or two but more leaders among those who are supposed to have been recalcitrant in this matter, saying, "We are trade unionists&#x2014;yes, but we are citizens first." It is that thought of a larger citizenship which lies below and behind and around the membership of any corporate body of a similar sort, be they masters or be they men, to which this House makes an appeal to-night. We appeal down to the foundation principles which underlie those tossing waves upon the surface. Those principles are not watery
<col>702</col>
but massive and strong; they are principles which our nation justly claims to have written upon its history large and clear. To quote the words of the most vigorous of our present day poets, what Mr. Rudyard Kipling calls&#x2014;
<quote>"The imperishable plinth of things,</quote>
<quote>Seen and unseen, which touch our peace."</quote>
I believe that we are entitled and that we do right to make an appeal to those larger principles and for considerateness for others, and, above all, the weakest amongst us. This House to-night joins in making such an appeal, and I do not believe that we shall make it in vain.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01409"><member>EARL GREY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with the noble and earnest appeal to which we have just listened I feel sure that the whole House will cordially sympathise. I wish that its impressive tone could reach the hearts and consciences of all those who have the power of influencing affairs in this country during the next few days. I listened with much sympathy to the able speech of the noble Lord who addressed the House from the Opposition Bench just now, but I fear I cannot agree with him in his view that the coal industry does not differ, so far as the State is concerned, from the other industries in the land. I do not see how it can be disputed that the railway industry and the coal industry, upon which the life of the country depends, are separated by a wide gulf from the other industries of this country.<lb/>
I do not think that this is the occasion&#x2014;certainly not for me at any rate&#x2014;to frame an indictment against His Majesty's Government, although I think it is quite possible to frame an indictment against them for their responsibility in bringing about the crisis with which we are confronted. I do not condemn His Majesty's Government in any way for having introduced this Bill and for having asked this House to pass it. It is admitted by the noble Marquess who moved the Second Reading of this Bill that it is essentially an <i>ad hoc</i> measure. He referred to it as not having any of the characteristics of a well-considered measure of permanent legislation, and there is no reason why we in this House should treat it as such. With a million miners on strike refusing to supply the material upon which the warmth and the food and the life of the country depend, I do not see how His
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0377"/>
<col>703</col>
Majesty's Government could avoid taking such action as in their opinion is best calculated to bring to an end this disastrous state of things. The only question, I think, before the House to-night is whether His Majesty's Government have taken the best means. It seems to me obvious that His Majesty's Government must so act as to enable them to secure the over-whelming force of public opinion behind them in any action they may think it desirable to take in defence of law and order. If by any unwise and premature interference they had antagonised the other trade unions of the country, then the present position of affairs might have been very much more serious than it is to-day. The object of the Government has been, by wise man&#x0153;uvring, to place itself in an unassailable position for resisting the revolutionary forces who may torpedo society in the hope of getting something out of the wreckage.<lb/>
What appears to me, coming new to this country after an absence of some years, is that there is a battle going on, not between Labour and Capital&#x2014;because there always has been that battle&#x2014;but a new battle of a strange character between the old unionism and Radical individualists who have endeavoured to bring about a reconciliation between Labour and Capital by collective bargaining, and a new unionism which appears to repudiate arrangements and contracts and to aim at the abolition of the right of private ownership. The old unionism has done a great deal for the working classes of this country. I know in my own part of England&#x2014;Northumberland and Durham&#x2014;that the influence of Mr. Burt. Mr. Fenwick, and Mr. John Wilson, who, I believe, are the leaders of the old unionism and who for the moment appear to have been sidetracked, has helped by means of the collective bargaining to which we have all been accustomed to give our allegiance, to bring the miners into a condition of very great prosperity compared to the conditions under which they suffered some years ago. I think any of your Lordships who may have happened to read the most interesting autobiography of Mr. John Wilson, who was, if he is not now, the nominal leader of the miners in the county of Durham, cannot fail to realise that by the methods of the old unionism the conditions and life of the miners of this country have been improved in a most
<col>704</col>
marked manner, and I believe that if the miners had been content to follow their old leaders, their old leaders would have been able to obtain for them in the future, by the same methods which have been so successful in the past, still further advantages. Whether they will be able to obtain these advantages under the new unionism I very greatly doubt.<lb/>
I listened with the greatest attention and interest to the speech of the noble Marquess who moved the Second Reading of this Bill. He informed us that while under the Bill the minimum wage will become operative as soon as the Act is passed, yet it might be possible by a friendly arrangement between owners and workmen to, as far as I could understand him, avert the necessity of giving the minimum wage to men who are working underground until the colliery has been placed in its normal condition. I have been quite unable to find in the Bill any provision which will enable the wishes of the noble Marquess as expressed in his speech in introducing the Second Reading to be carried out, and I wish to give notice that when we arrive at the Committee stage it is my intention to move an Amendment which will enable the noble Marquess's views to become legalised.<lb/>
To the speech of the noble Lord on the question of the ballot I listened with sympathy. While I abstain from criticising the action of His Majesty's Government since the miners put down their tools and abandoned work in the mines, I have always felt that His Majesty's Government had ample opportunity, for they had full warning that this strike was coming, to take such action as was necessary in order to secure a ballot under secret conditions. It is impossible to say what would have happened, but it is a matter of common talk among people resident in the various coal fields that if there had been a secret ballot of the same character as we have when we elect Members to the House of Commons the vote against the strike would have been so great as possibly would have averted the strike taking place at all. If that is so, I think the Government are open to criticism for not having taken that action. They may have been influenced by feelings of apprehension lest such an action might be regarded as an interference with matters which are exclusively within the
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0378"/>
<col>705</col>
jurisdiction of trade unions themselves. If they were influenced by those apprehensions I think that they were a little more timid than was necessary. We insist on a secret ballot for Parliamentary elections. To the average man in the street&#x2014;I am not talking of anybody in this House&#x2014;it is not a matter of very great importance whether the Liberals or the Conservatives are in office. The average man realises that the force of public opinion causes the Party on the Treasury Bench, whatever may be its political complexion, to act very much in the same way. But, my Lords, a strike in the coal industry is a matter of vital interest to every single person in this country; and if it is thought desirable and necessary in the interests of the freedom of the community that there should be a secret ballot for Parliamentary elections, then I would say a <i>fortiori</i> it is necessary that there should be a secret ballot on a question upon the answer to which depends the well-being of the whole State.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01410"><member>LORD ST. DAVIDS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, in his speech to-night, drew a very gloomy picture of the state of the country if this strike should continue. But gloomy as the picture was, I almost think that the black paint was not put on thick enough. It seems to me that there is a certain lack of imagination among our people. The people do not realise yet that this thing is only beginning, and that if the miners went back to work to-morrow it would be days before coal could be got in sufficient quantities to feed our great industries; and I do not think people have realised what ruin there would be, as the noble Marquess said, if this strike were to go on for three or four weeks longer.<lb/>
With a great deal of the first part of the speech of the noble Marquess I found myself very much in sympathy. He cannot believe that by Act of Parliament you can suspend the operation of economic laws. The noble Marquess does not believe that the workmen will really get in the long run higher wages by endeavouring to have them fixed by Act of Parliament. I cannot believe anything of the kind either. But it seems to me, whether we like it or not, that we are very likely "in" for a long course of legislation similar to this whichever side is in power. Is it not clear that the forces of organised labour are
<col>706</col>
running across the lines of both political Parties? When we had that disastrous strike attended with a great deal of rioting last summer I was struck by the fact that the two places where the worst rioting took place were Wales and Liverpool. I have no doubt the noble Lord below the gangway would find a very good explanation with regard to Wales, but in Liverpool the rioting was equally bad, if not worse. Liverpool is a place that can be relied upon to support the policy of noble Lords opposite&#x2014;I might almost say whatever it is&#x2014;and yet when it comes to a question of labour&#x2014;not of Home Rule, or Disestablishment, or Free Trade, or of one of the things people generally vote about&#x2014;Liverpool is found to be one of the most violently democratic spots in the whole Kingdom. I think that is an object lesson to us as to what the future is going to be.<lb/>
Labour, whether we like it or not, was put in power in this country with the extension of the franchise twenty-five years ago. Labour generally votes as other people vote, sometimes on one side and sometimes on the other, putting one side in office to-day and the other side in office to-morrow. But if we are going to have organised labour going solid on questions of wages&#x2014;and it looks very much as if we are&#x2014;then I think this Bill is going to be a precedent, and you ought to face the fact that it is going to be a precedent and that we shall be discussing this sort of question in this House over and over again in years to come. Frankly I am sure the noble Marquess is right, even in spite of holding that view, in believing that it is not the duty of this House to throw itself violently against movements of that kind. I think our part ought to be, if we can, to guide them and direct them, but not to try and oppose forces of that kind of almost incalculable magnitude.<lb/>
There was one part of the noble Marquess's speech with which I found myself quite in agreement&#x2014;that was where he pointed out one particular weakness of the Bill. It seems to me that the framers of this Bill must have three objects in view. First and foremost, they have to try and get the men back to work. From information that has reached us to-night from different parts of the country I have very great hope and very considerable confidence that the Bill will succeed in that object, and that work will be resumed. Even in
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0379"/>
<col>707</col>
Wales, I understand, there is a considerable feeling in favour of making a trial of the provisions of the Bill. If so, the Bill will have succeeded in what is its first and foremost object. But there is a secondary object. You may get the men back, but in the case of the poorer mines will they be able to work, or, at any rate, will they be able to work continuously under this Bill? I am not interested in mining myself except for the smallest trifle&#x2014;a few hundred pounds in one mine, I think&#x2014;and I do not speak from the point of view of a man interested in the ownership of mines. But we must all of us consider what effect this is going to have upon the industries of the country and the employment of labour. There are undoubtedly mines that are not being worked at a profit now. I will tell you what I would have liked the Government to do.<lb/>
This Bill is of so revolutionary a character&#x2014;or at any rate of so experimental a character&#x2014;that it seems to me you might have added another experiment or two on to it without endangering political consistency or anything of that kind, and I should have liked something added to this Bill which would have made it possible for the Government to take and work some of the poorer mines, of course bearing the loss if there was a loss, because you could not impose upon an owner the obligation to work a mine and to make a loss in doing it. I should have liked to see the Government take some powers of that kind in this Bill, and I do not feel at all certain that sooner or later they will not have to take some such powers. I will tell you why. It seems to me as an observer of the relations between Capital and Labour that half the trouble between the owners and the workmen comes from an insufficient knowledge of one another's positions. I was very much struck in connection with this Bill by what a coal owner said to me a short time ago. He called on me and told me that he would have to close his mine if this Bill was carried. I think now that the exceptions in the Bill have probably made him safe, and that he will be able to carry on&#x2014;I hope so, at any rate&#x2014;but he was telling me how very bad his position was, and incidentally informed me what his profits had been over a term of years. I know the district where this mine is and the people about it very well. This particular mine is supposed in the locality to be a very rich one. The owner's profits
<col>708</col>
are supposed to be very large indeed, something like eight or ten times larger than they really are, and I believe myself that if the colliers employed in that mine really had a notion of what the position is they would not be clamouring for a minimum wage to-day.<lb/>
It is ignorance of conditions that we have to deal with. If you had the Government working some of these mines&#x2014;not for three years or anything like it, but for three or four months&#x2014;you would have Government auditors called in who would keep the accounts of those mines, and the miners or the trade union secretaries could be invited to come and inspect the accounts themselves, or they could even call in their own accountants to see what was going and what profits were being made. The miners' leaders, even those of them who are supposed to be most extreme, do not want to close mines; they are not so foolish as that. They know if a mine is closed that there will be men thrown out of work, that there will be miners competing in the labour market, and that wages will be going down; but when you have the owners saying, on the one side, that if legislation of this kind is passed 20 or 30 per cent. of the mines may have to close, and when you have the men, on the other side, believing that there is very little truth in that, or that at any rate only a very few mines would have to close, I say what we want in the interests of both parties is to get the facts. I believe the noble Marquess, in calling attention to the absence of any provision of that sort, put his finger on the greatest blot of the Bill, and if the whole scheme is sooner or later a failure, that, I think, is what the Government will have to come to.<lb/>
One thing I would like to impress upon your Lordships in considering the matter is this. It has been stated very widely, and there have been constant comments on it in the newspapers, that the men's organisations are getting short of money, that they will be starved out, and that they will have to return to work directly whether they like the terms or not. Sooner or later, any body of men may be starved out; but I think it very unlikely indeed that the miners will be starved out before the community at large. It is not a mere question of the employers or of the men. It is a question of all of us, the rest of the inhabitants of this country,
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0380"/>
<col>709</col>
and we know what a disaster it will be if this thing goes on for another two or three weeks. But I would not like any member of your Lordships' House to go away with the idea that the miners' plans are likely to break down in anything approaching that time. When there is a strike, when money runs out altogether, these men do not pay for things; they do not pay their rent, they do not buy clothes, and sooner or later they have to give up beer and tobacco. Eventually they come down to the bare necessities of life, but a few shillings a week will keep life in a man and his family. These men are very good customers at the shops in their neighbourhood. They spend almost the whole of their money locally, and a little miners' shop which has been making a great, deal of money out of trading with the miners is not going, if it can avoid it&#x2014;for the question of competition has to be considered&#x2014;to refuse these men a few shillings credit for at any rate the first few weeks of the strike. Therefore, my Lords, I think you would he wise to dismiss that idea from your minds in the consideration of this Bill. If a settlement is to come under this Bill or in any other way in time to save the great industries of this country, it has to be reached by agreement, and, after all, trade can only prosper in the long run if people are working willingly. If every man is trying to see how little work he can do, no industry will prosper. What we want is to come to a settlement by agreement if it can possibly be arrived at.<lb/>
One thing I want also to protest against most strongly is the view put forward by sonic of the extreme leaders of the miners, that they are doing this to show their power. They are stating that they are demonstrating to us that unless we, the rest of their countrymen, fall in with their demands they can ruin the country. That seems to me to be a commonplace statement. Men employed in other great industries besides that of mining can ruin the country if they give their mind to it. After all, the difficult thing is, not to ruin a country, but to save it. I was calling to mind a time many years ago when this country was at war and we had a strike of the sailors in the Navy. The ships could not go to sea because the sailors were on strike. I say there are other classes in this country besides miners who, if they were dissatisfied with their conditions
<col>710</col>
of labour and struck <i>en masse,</i> could undoubtedly ruin the country. Considering the great masses of men who have been about the country with no occupation, some of them because they chose not to work, others because they could not help it, I think w e can all congratulate ourselves on the extraordinary order that on the whole has been maintained and the good fellowship which has reigned among all classes. In the county in which I live there is very little mining. There are only a few hundred miners altogether in some small pits. But I heard the other day that 300 or 400 men who were on strike in the largest of these pits had spent their time without pay in digging out a reservoir in connection with local waterworks in order to save the ratepayers expense. That is the kind of spirit in which one would like to see these affairs conducted.<lb/>
I do think that we ought every one of us, in all conditions of life, to use every kind of argument and pressure to get the former state of things re-established and work resumed. This is what I would like the miners' leaders to put before their friends. Coal has gone to a fabulous price because of the miners' action. The trouble is not greater than many of us thought it would be, and the reason for that is that the reserve supplies of fuel in the country are undoubtedly much larger than anybody would have guessed was the case. I suppose people have been foreseeing this trouble, and have been stocking coal to a considerable extent. I believe in most parts of the country there are still reserves of fuel. The trouble is likely to be greatest in the towns nearer the mining centres, where the people were in the habit before the strike of getting their coal by the truck load at a time, and it never occurred to them to make any reserves at all. But coal has gone up to an enormous price owing to the miners' action. What is the result? The miners on the Continent of Europe who started to strike have tumbled back to work again. They have gone back in a great hurry, no doubt because they and their employers can make very large profits out of the high price of coal owing to the coal of Great Britain being out of the market.<lb/>
I would ask the miners to consider this. Do they want the miners on the Continent to prosper by their trouble and their sorrow? Some of them no doubt think, in places
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0381"/>
<col>711</col>
where there is ill-feeling&#x2014;because, although the strike as a whole is remarkable for the good feeling which has obtained, there are individual spots where there is a certain amount of personal feeling&#x2014;that by continuing the strike they are punishing the owners. I doubt whether they are punishing the owners anything like as much as they are punishing other people. The owners, we know, have considerable stocks of coal and have been selling at fabulous prices, and though they are sorry for the strike I feel sure that they have some pretty substantial consolations in their banking accounts. The working men, if they continue this strike, are punishing themselves and their families, and punishing the men of nearly every other class who depend on their labour. They are punishing their countrymen, but they are benefiting the foreigner. I do hope and believe that they will take advantage of the call for thought which is given them by this Bill, and that even the most determined of them will reconsider their position and go back to work before a still greater disaster is inflicted on the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01411"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I agree with the opening words of the noble Lord opposite, Lord St. Davids, that this great trouble is not an isolated one. You may draw distinctions, as did the noble Earl, Lord Grey, between the conditions of the coal industry, the railway industry, and other industries, but I believe Lord St. Davids is right when he says that the example of this strike, the action of the Government in connection therewith and the legislation which Parliament is asked to pass will affect almost all other industries, and that we are "in" for many years for a consideration of these great labour problems. In this epoch of industrial unrest it seems to me to be very necessary that we should distinguish between the legitimate aspirations of the manual worker and the attempts to exploit those aspirations which are made by organisations of Socialists or Syndicalists. When I talk of Socialism in this connection I mean, of course, that extreme form which seeks to appropriate all property and to manage all our concerns through State agency. That form of Socialism, unjust as we think it in its methods, ruinous as we believe it would be in its effects, at any rate is promoted, has been thought out, largely by idealists&#x2014;men to whom the idea of each man working, not for himself
<col>712</col>
or for his family, but for his country, for the common good, is an inspiration.<lb/>
But when we come to the Syndicalist theory we pass abruptly to the ancient and primitive desire of one set of men to appropriate for their exclusive advantage property at present enjoyed by another set of men. In our natural indignation at such a scheme, and notwithstanding our resolution to combat it by all the means in our power, do not let us do injustice to the legitimate, the wholesome, and the natural aspirations of the manual labourer, be he a miner or some one else. There is not one of us who, if we were in the position of that manual worker, would not seek to better his lot and to better it by means of organisation. Consider how very difficult it is for the miner or the manual labourer really to understand what is possible for him and what is, under all the circumstances of a given industry, a fair wage for him. What Lord St. Davids said struck me as being wholly true. Ignorance is at the bottom of the whole of the difficulty. When a miner&#x2014;we take the miner as our illustration to-night&#x2014;when a miner sees that a colliery owner, with whom he has been bargaining for many years, and from whom, as he thinks, he has extracted small rises in wages with great difficulty, has died, and he sees that he was a very rich man, perhaps a millionaire, the natural conclusion for the miner to come to is that he has not had his fair share in the rewards of the industry. He remembers the millionaire; he forgets the man who failed. And not only does he forget the man who failed, but he never realises how greatly the brains of the management count for the success of the industry; and he cannot know those things unless, as Lord St. Davids said, he is brought closely into contact with the facts. Therefore I do trust that we who are not manual workers will approach this question with a genuine and never failing sympathy, but at the same time I hope we shall never be afraid to tell the manual worker when we think his demand unreasonable or his proposals impracticable or dangerous to the State.<lb/>
And here, my Lords, I would pass to a criticism on the action of the Government all through their years of office in this connection. Have they always been courageous and said what they think of the proposals of Socialists and Syndicalists? Those theories are just as hostile to Liberals
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0382"/>
<col>713</col>
as they are to Unionists. Everything that the Party opposite cares for in the State is at stake, just as much as what we care for. Yet I have never read a single word of condemnation from any Minister even of the most extreme theories or utterances of Socialists and only quite recently a mild rebuke of the Syndicalist theory. On the contrary, their speakers and supporters in the Press and on the platform are always pretending, what is obviously untrue, that Liberalism and Socialism are only two wings of one movement. Again, why did not the Government at the very beginning of this strike take the course that my noble friend Lord Willoughby de Broke said they ought to have taken, and which I contend every Government ought to have taken, and that is to say front the very beginning "We intend to keep the, peace. No man who wishes to work shall want protection from us"? That is the primary duty of any Government in such circumstances. It is not enough now at the eleventh hour to come down to this house and say, "We have never been asked for protection and refused it."<lb/>
And what about these breaches of contract? The noble Marquess who introduced this Bill to-night uttered an eloquent panegyric on the efforts of the Prime Minister. It is true that the Prime Minister has devoted himself with the w hole of his physical and intellectual powers to the solution of this great question, but I contend he has done a great public disservice in glossing over this breach of faith. There has been a gross breach of faith both in Wales and in Scotland, and it is the duty of public men, when such breaches of faith are committed, not to connive at them or pretend that they do not exist, because you cannot found the regeneration of the position of the workingman on broken faith. The very first consideration for the prosperity of this country, for that social regeneration to which we all look forward, is that faith should be respected between man and man. Just as the owner is bound to keep faith to the workman, so the workman should be bound to keep faith to the employer.<lb/>
I will ask your Lordships to consider what the history of this Government has been in bringing us to our present position. They have not created the great social problem. But what has been their contribution to its solution m the sphere of legislation? We have three Acts of Parlia-
<col>714</col>
ment&#x2014;the Eight Hours Act, the Trades Disputes Act, and now this Act. Not one single one of those measures would the Government have passed on its own responsibility and on its own judgment. Not one of those Acts but were extorted from the Government by an influence which they felt unable or unwilling to resist. But to what end are they being surely brought? I am quite certain of this, that they never fort saw the path they were treading or the path they were leading the country to tread. As so often happens in this country, I believe that their unconsidered and reluctant action is bringing us surely towards the only solution of these labour troubles. If your Lordships think of it, there really are only two methods of dealing with them. A Government can hold the ring, be absolutely neutral, between the two parties, announce that any man who wishes to strike may strike, that any man who wishes to work may work, that all disorder will be rigorously repressed. That up to now has been the plan.<lb/>
Speaking only for myself, I believe the time has passed when that policy can any longer hold the field. The ring has become too large; there are too many people, too great a multitude, within the ring who suffer from the fight intense misery and even death, and the interests of the country which are at stake are too vast, too vital, for us any longer to allow this industrial war to go on uncontrolled by the Government any more than private war is now allowed to go on uncontrolled by the Government. The only alternative is some system of industrial courts with compulsory arbitration and a sanction behind the decision of the courts, the power to enforce their decrees and to exact penalties for the evasion of those decisions or for breach of contract. I believe that quite surely the action of the Government has led this country forward towards that as the final solution. I admit it is a colossal revolution. Those were the words used in another place by Mr. Balfour. I admit that it is a colossal revolution, but I believe it is the only path of safety, and that the day is past when a policy of merely holding the ring can be maintained. But we require something else than this code of industrial legislation. The nation requires certain safeguards which it has not yet got. It requires, in the first place, safeguards against the continuation of disputes which threaten the welfare and safety of the
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0383"/>
<col>715</col>
nation. In the second place, it requires safeguards against the whole nation being held up by a section of the nation. It requires safeguards that the government of the country shall only be in the hands of the legitimate Government of the country, and not partly in the hands of a rival and illegitimate government. What the Government of our country is we know. They are the representatives of the majority in the House of Commons, and we know how the House of Commons is elected. But there are men and there are organisations in this country who seek to form a rival government. All we know about them is that they represent, not the whole nation, but a small section of the nation. What their credentials are we do not know, or how they were elected we do not know. We have gut to this point now, that we require this safeguard&#x2014;that the Government of the country should govern and should not admit any rivalry in the field of government. I do not say that that rivalry has yet actually occurred. I do say that there are men who are trying to work forward to a position of power which will enable them to act as rivals. It is quite incompatible with the good government or the prosperity of the country or of its stability that men in this country should wield so vast a power without any responsibility.<lb/>
There is another irony of fate that is awaiting the Government. They have led us forward in this path to a system of industrial law such as I have described, and part of that law doubtless will be the fixation of minimum wages. I shall have a word to say presently about that word "minimum," but still it sufficiently describes the contention of the miners and the contention of other bodies of working men. If you fix a minimum wage by Courts established by law you will have to follow that by a minimum tariff. How can you protect the labour of the working man by a minimum wage if you do not protect the product of his labour by a minimum tariff? The Government themselves have no idea what the effect of this strike is going to be on, we will say, the iron industry of this country. They know the price of coal is going to rise, but the price of coal may rise so much as to take away the whole of the existing margin of profit in some portions of the iron industry. As a permanent system is it conceivably possible that Par-
<col>716</col>
liament should at the same time legislate so as to raise wages and refuse to protect the industry whose whole existence may be jeopardised by that rise of wages?<lb/>
I have one word to say, my Lords, on the subject of the word "minimum," because I think it is open to some misunderstanding. It seems to me to be only properly used in connection with piecework. If men are accustomed to work on piece-work it follows that conceivably they might earn almost nothing in a day's work, and therefore to apply a minimum wage to piece-workers is intelligible, because it means that no matter how little work is got through during the day the man will receive not less than a certain sum. But when you pass from the consideration of the case of the piece-workers I submit that the word "minimum" really does not mean anything more than current or standard wage. What these courts are going to do, for instance, in the case of men who are not piece-workers is this. They are going to fix a rate of wages, the lowest rate of wages which men may get doing a particular class of work. That is exactly what is done in every industrial arbitration to-day, only the word "minimum" is not used. Therefore I think a good deal of unnecessary prejudice would have been avoided if it had been borne clearly in mind that apart from the question of piece-workers the word "minimum" is really the same as current or standard rate of wage.<lb/>
In conclusion, I should like to say a word about the details of the Bill, because I think I owe no apology for discussing those general questions out of which the Bill has arisen. The Bill itself is admittedly a stopgap. The Government have found it very difficult to bring forward any arguments in favour of the Bill, and for a very natural and intelligible reason. When the Bill was first conceived, as anybody who heard the speech of the noble Marquess in this House must have felt sure, the Government really believed that the passage of this Bill would end the coal strike. Now they hope so, but they cannot feel sure. Therefore they have felt considerable difficulty in framing their arguments in support of this Bill. What does this stopgap Bill contain? It contains a good deal that is evil. It contains a condonation of a breach of faith. It contains the suggestion that Parliament can fix wages. I would point out to
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0384"/>
<col>717</col>
those who would like to reject this Bill this fact, that if this Bill were rejected to-day in this House that evil would still remain, because it does not depend for its existence only on this Bill&#x2014;it depends on the line of argument and on the action of the Government and of their supporters during the past four weeks. If we thought that by the rejection of this Bill we should save this country from great evils which would otherwise be avoided we should not hesitate to advise this House to reject it. But I have given my reasons why that is not our view. On the other hand, this Bill does for the first time&#x2014;I believe it is the first time&#x2014;establish the principle of a statutory court to deal with this question of industrial disputes, and for the reasons I have already given I believe that that is a step forward&#x2014;a small step but an irretraceable step&#x2014;towards the only final possible solution of this question.<lb/>
Therefore the only question we have to ask ourselves is this. Is it for the good of the country that this Bill should be rejected or that it should pass? I do not deny that out of the dilemma and difficulty of the Government we could pluck a Party advantage. On the other hand, I would prefer to quote the noble words used in the House of Commons last night by one of the Labour leaders, Air. Stephen Walsh. He said he was a Labour leader but he was "a citizen first." and I think that, my Lords, applies to us. Our duty is to regard this Bill first as citizens. The Executive Government of the day tell us that they believe&#x2014;they hope&#x2014;that the passage of this Bill will enable them to bring about that peace which is the one thing the country needs. Therefore I do not think we need have any hesitation in acknowledging the patriotism of the advice given to us by the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne. The responsibility is not with us. The responsibility is with the Government. But, having the views that I have endeavoured to express about the Bill, it would be unpatriotic, in my judgment, if we took any other course than give the Executive Government of the day the weapon for which they ask.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01412"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (EARL LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl towards the end of his speech, made some observations about the Bill, but the greater part of his speech was directed to what seems to me if I may say so with
<col>718</col>
respect a quite irrelevant and not altogether worthy effort of slowing that the Government of the day were to blame for the strike, the unrest, the industrial trouble, and for all the future horrors which he depicted in the most gloomy colours. I forget how many lie said the delinquencies of the Government were, but they were numerous. But I desire to speak a few words in regard to the Bill itself and to explain why the Bill is necessary. My Lords, the Bill is an experiment and intended to meet a most grave industrial crisis that has arisen from no sin that I know of on the part of the Government at all. It is a very serious crisis, as all acknowledge. The industry is vast, employing 700,000 or perhaps 1,000,000 men, and millions of capital are embarked in it. Every attempt on our part&#x2014;and the best intellects in our ranks devoted attention assiduously to those efforts&#x2014;to arrive at agreement has failed and the consequence is that the work of a million men is discontinued and they and their families are suffering, and the suffering may be extended to vast numbers of others who must be thrown out of employment.<lb/>
We are discussing a most grave and serious situation in the interest of the whole country. In these circumstances, it was the duty of the Government to try if they could in any way to avert the train of calamities to which I have referred. There has been no attempt to constrain the men to resume work; that would have been futile; and there has been no attempt to constrain the owners to open their pits. We have not attempted to do either of those things. We have attempted to induce the parties on both sides and to offer them a bridge over which, if they like, they may retrace their steps and thus avoid all this misery. The men are to have a minimum wage, which the owners are obliged to pay if they employ the men, and that minimum wage is to be fairly settled by the method provided in the Bill. The noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition was perfectly right in saying that there is some measure of constraint in that. It is that you say to the owners, If you employ men in this industry, and you may not employ them unless you like, but if you do you must employ them on terms which are satisfactory, not to the Government, but to a fair tribunal which is set up under the authority of this Bill. I am told that this is interfering with the individual. Of
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0385"/>
<col>719</col>
course it is. If individualism was allowed to go unchecked in this great industrial country we should not last twelve months as a great nation. We are told we have broken contracts. I will assume for the sake of argument that this Bill may involve the breaking of contracts. It seems to be forgotten that contracts were broken in Ireland in 1881 when the Fair Rent Court was set up for one class of tenantry, and that by the extension most properly of that Act in 1887 by a Conservative Administration to leases, all leases were broken. Is it fair, then, to turn round now and to say "because you are breaking contracts that is a conclusive argument against the Bill"?<lb/>
I have heard the speeches in this House and have read the debates in the House of Commons and I have not heard or read of any practical alternative for the present emergency being suggested. Is it not necessary and right for us to take some steps to bring the parties together? If we are to use force, as has been suggested, ought we not to rally public opinion conclusively to our side? Ought we not to get the public to put the pressure of public, opinion&#x2014;the greatest influence which this country can bring to bear&#x2014;upon the two sides? There is not a Member on either side of the House who would deny that it is right that we should make some practical effort of that kind. What is the alternative to what we propose? There is no answer at all. There was no answer in the House of Commons. Pray do not think I am saying this in a challenging spirit. I want to get noble Lords and those whom they influence and those who may read our debates to realise that the crisis is grave. Our proposals may be open to criticism and objection but some action is admittedly necessary, and no alternative has been suggested from any quarter of either House of Parliament.<lb/>
It has been said by more than one noble Lord that the Government were neglecting their duty to provide protection for people who were liable to intimidation or violence. Where is the person whom we have failed to support? There may, of course, be cases in which riots arise before the police can come on the spot, but I have heard no case suggested in which we have refused to give the necessary amount of protection. A noble Lord, Lord Hylton, said that Judges and magistrates were not protected. Can he give me their names?</membercontribution></p>
<col>720</col>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01413"><member>LORD HYLTON</member><membercontribution>: When I was speaking on that particular point I mentioned that certain members holding high office in His Majesty's present Government had during the last few months or the last year or two used language abusing or certainly holding up to ridicule and contempt Judges of the High Court and magistrates. That is what I mean.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01414"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: I am quite prepared to meet that if the noble Lord thinks fit to bring it forward on a proper occasion; but that is not what the noble Lord said. I understood him to say that Judges and magistrates were not protected by law. Perhaps the noble Lord did not mean to say that but I think he cannot substantiate it if he does advance it. We are also told that the miners are prevented from returning to work by the state of the law. I am not aware of that. I know that where requests for protection have been made protection has always been given. It is said that in some mysterious way the Trades Disputes Act prevents people being protected from picketers. There is not a clause in that Act which interferes with the full operation of the law in regard to violence, intimidation, or pressure of any kind. The present statute and common law of the land is sufficient to protect anybody against any form of intimidation or violence. I say, further, that there is not a lawyer in the country who will contradict me; but, if there is, I should like to know in what way he says that that Act interferes in any way with the full operation of the law in regard to such matters. The noble Earl accuses us of not making a declaration that we would protect people who required protection. I do not know why we should be always expected to rehearse the Decalogue at the request of a noble Lord. As a matter of fact it is one of the elementary duties of a Government and protection is the elementary right of every subject against violence or intimidation or abuse of the law; and if we have knowingly or wilfully refrained from giving protection show us that we have done so.<lb/>
What will be the outcome of this Bill?&#x2014;because the Bill itself really is not challenged either in this House or in the other House as being an almost necessary expedient at the present time. It depends on the temper and good sense and moderation of all parties to this dispute. I
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0386"/>
<col>721</col>
listened with great interest to what the most rev. Primate the Archbishop said on this subject, and I agree with every word he said. What we have to rely upon is the national character, that the people of the country will act in the way in which they have always acted even in the most trying times&#x2014;with forbearance, self-restraint, common-sense, and a sense of justice. If we cannot rely on those qualities then as Sir Edward Grey said we shall not last long as a nation. I believe that we shall come through this trial as we have come through others, by the inherent qualities of the race to which we belong.<lb/>
I will only say a few words upon the general aspect of the industrial situation to which reference was made by the noble Marquess and the noble Earl. The noble Marquess thought that there was a colossal conspiracy at the bottom of this strike. I cannot help thinking he is mistaken. I cannot affirm one way or the other; but supposing there is a conspiracy got up by idealists or theorists or agitators with wicked designs. What is the best way to meet a conspiracy of that kind? The noble Marquess admitted, also, as all must admit, that there are grievances among the workmen in many trades, and he admitted the need of better surroundings for workmen in the poorer classes in this country, and he said it in a way which showed that he not only sympathised with it but deeply felt it to be one of the truths of our modern life. He said, further, what was also true, that we had taught them to look for these better surroundings. This is the third educated generation since we established elementary schools, and there have been constant researches into the social condition of the people with appalling results during the last twenty-five years. There are more facilities for reading and learning of the conditions that obtain, and they have been largely taken advantage of by the poorer classes, who have very properly and naturally had the matter brought to their attention for the purpose of creating that reasonable discontent which ought to exist with the surroundings of many of the poorer people in this country. Working men have more experience in combination than before, and combinations are not necessarily bad things. Some of the best work in the country has been done by combination, conducted in a fair and honourable way. And still more now, people in this country
<col>722</col>
are accustomed to the spectacle of wasteful, vulgar, and I would say disgusting luxury paraded before their eyes, while they themselves find it difficult to live in decent comfort. And I say they are not wicked or dishonest men who say that for the interest of others, as well as themselves&#x2014;perhaps others more than themselves&#x2014;we intend to have clean homes; we do not intend to have our children herded in crowded rooms; we will have a degree of comfort and a chance to save something for our later years. I think they are perfectly right, and I am certain that in spirit everyone in this House and in the other House desires to further and assist those causes.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, the way to meet the agitators to whom reference has been made is just this: to provide those things to which I have been adverting, and not to allow fancied vested interests or prepossessions to prevent us from helping on the great works of social reform that are going forward, such, for example, as the great Insurance Act of Mr. Lloyd George, coming from the spirit of a man who is as anxious to do good to the people from whom he sprang as any man ever was in this country. I am not going to enter upon the Party or controversial aspect of this matter, but I do say that, if all of us were to lay aside Party feeling and Party considerations and help to forward social reform of that kind, agitators would have very little to do in this country. I say this simply because the subject has been raised by different noble Lords, and. I should not like not to say what I feel on the subject. I repeat that this Bill is au expedient in a dangerous crisis, and that is the justification for its being brought forward.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01416"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I had hoped that, by the leave of the House, we might have been able to proceed with the next stage of the Bill forthwith, and thence to proceed with all its remaining stages. Your Lordships will remember that, in speaking on the Second Reading, I adverted to a few Amendments which I desired to move, and which I was able to describe as Amendments that had been consented to by both parties&#x2014;namely, by the representatives of the owners and of the miners. I am sorry to say that I find
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0387"/>
<col>723</col>
I was wrong, through a misunderstanding for which I cannot blame myself or anybody else, simply because it was a pure misunderstanding. It relates to the Amendment in Clause 2, subsection (1), line 36. Your Lordships will observe that as the Bill is printed the words are&#x2014;
<quote>"In settling any minimum rate of wages the joint district board shall have regard to the average daily rate of wages paid to the workmen of the class for which the minimum rate is to be settled."</quote>
And the amendment which it was intended to move was to omit the words "average daily rate of wages paid to" and to insert the words "prevailing day wage rate for."<lb/>
I am hound to say that in my judgment and I think also in the judgment of a great many other people more competent to judge than myself, this is a matter of exceedingly small importance. What the chairman and his board are told to have regard to in a Bill of this kind represents a mere sign-post, and no real burden of necessity is thrown upon them on account of the absence or presence of such words. But the House will remember that in moving the Second Reading I spoke of the singular atmosphere of suspicion which has surrounded all these discussions in spite of the excellent humour which has prevailed on both sides. There has been a continual and an acute nervousness on each side&#x2014;I do not know that it applies to one side more than the other&#x2014;that some advantage would be taken of them, and that words might be inserted in the measure which would prove in the event to be perilous to their interest. In this particular case this nervousness exists, although I do not believe it myself to be well founded on either side. If the words "average daily rate of wages paid to" were left in, it is the fear of the coal owners&#x2014;not, as I believe, the well founded fear&#x2014;that the district board would found the minimum rate of wages upon the average earnings or gains of all classes of workers, pieceworkers and others, throughout the whole district, and they are under the impression that something like a direction to that effect would be given to the board. On the other hand, if the words "prevailing day wage rate for" are inserted in their place, the representatives of the men are afraid that the effect will be that the board will be obliged to take as the minimum any low rate of wages which may be paid in the district to any considerable body of
<col>724</col>
workers, and that the board would thereby be prevented from raising the minimum even if they thought it unfair.<lb/>
As I say, neither of those contentions seems to me, I confess, to have any real substance. One is tempted to say, as my right hon friends must have been often tempted to say all through these negotiations, "a plague on both your houses," because I do not believe the matter is one of real importance or substance, but it is regarded by both sides as of real substance. Therefore I do not feel justified, in view of the fact that many noble Lords who may be interested in this particular Amendment are no longer in the House, either in pressing this Amendment on the House at this hour and of attempting to send it down to another place as an Amendment which has been agreed, or of attempting to send the Bill down without the Amendment supposing your Lordships are willing to take that course. The most that we can do, therefore, is, I think, to postpone the Committee stage till to-morrow, and in the interval an attempt will be made, as to the success of which I am not. I confess, exceedingly sanguine, to find some form of words upon which both parties can definitely agree. I greatly regret that this misunderstanding has taken place, but in the circumstances it seems to me to be futile to attempt to proceed with the Committee stage at this moment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01417"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think you will agree with the noble Marquess that the course which he suggests is the only one which this House can adopt with propriety in view of the circumstances. The matter is, perhaps, of greater importance than the noble Marquess supposes. He reviewed the alternative proposals which had been made to him and seemed to think that it did not very much matter which of them found its way into the Bill, but it is quite clear that the parties most interested think otherwise, and think that the matter is one of very considerable moment. The House will recollect that the idea upon which this Bill was founded was that these boards should be given an absolutely free hand to deal, on the one hand with the question of the minimum rate of wage, and, on the other, with the safeguards necessary to protect the mine owners against fraud. When the Bill was in another place an Amendment was inserted
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0388"/>
<col>725</col>
&#x2014;an Amendment connected with the name of Mr. Buxton&#x2014;which did certainly involve a considerable departure from that original idea, because by it His Majesty's Government went out of their way to give a direction&#x2014;and a very clear direction&#x2014;to the boards that in fixing the minimum rate they are to have special regard to certain circumstances. Unquestionably that Amendment created great apprehension in the minds of many of the coal owners, and they were greatly comforted and reassured when the noble Marquess earlier this evening announced to the House that he had, we understood with the consent of all concerned, discovered a formula which deprived the new clause of its objectionable features. Now it turns out that, most unfortunately, those words are objected to by one of the parties interested. I hope that the noble Marquess may be successful in finding a formula which will be not less successful than his original formula in meeting the objections which were felt to the Amendment inserted in the House of Commons, but it is quite clear that we are not in a position this evening to discuss the relative merits of two different forms of drafting dealing with a matter which is, after all, very difficult and very technical, and therefore I am extremely glad that the noble Marquess has given us a little more time in which to consider the question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01418"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition has dealt very gently with the Government, but I must say that, so far as I am concerned, I cannot recall any instance in which a more pitiable exhibition has been witnessed than in the utterances of the noble Marquess who leads the House. This afternoon he told us that it was most essential and important that the Bill should be passed through all its stages to-day. He announced to us that some Amendments were about to be moved, and that there was only one of them
<col>726</col>
to which any importance was attached. It so happens that I was approached with regard to this particular Amendment and invited to move it if necessary. I was subsequently informed that the noble Marquess, after consultation with the owners and with the men, had decided to move the Amendment himself. It is perfectly obvious, although the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition was too polite to mention it, what has happened. The noble Marquess made a bargain with the owners and with the men that this. Amendment should be moved here, and what has obviously happened is that the representatives of the men have been to him and told him that they are not going to take it, and thereupon he comes here and has, I may say, the audacity to tell us that he finds he is not in a position to carry out his promise, having actually intimated the exact words in which he was going to move the Amendment. All I have to say is that a bargain is a bargain. We have had experience before now that bargains are not kept, but unfortunately from what we have heard to-night it is evident that no reliance can be placed on bargains which are made with the official representatives of the Government.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01449"><b>1.</b>&#x2014;(1) It skill be an implied term of every contract for the employment of a workman underground in a coal mine that the employer shall pay to that workman wages at not less than the minimum rate settled under this Act and applicable to that workman, unless it is certified in manner provided by the district rules that the workman is a person excluded under the district rules from the operation of this provision, or that the workman has forfeited the right to wages at the minimum rate by reason of his failure to comply with the conditions with respect to the regularity or efficiency of the work to be performed by the workmen laid down by those rules; and any agreement for the payment of wages in so far as it is in contravention of this provision shall be void.</p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01454"><member>EARL GREY</member><membercontribution>: I move, in subsection (3), after the words "The provisions of this section as to payment of wages at a minimum rate shall." to insert "subject to an agreement between the employer and workmen in any mine modifying, as respects the workmen being parties to such agreement, the provisions of this subsection." My object in moving this Amendment can be stated in a very few words. The Bill as drafted insists that a minimum wage shall take effect us from the date of the passing of this Act in all cases except those of aged and infirm workmen. It was evident from his speech in moving the Second Reading of the Bill yesterday that the noble Marquess realised that there might be other cases in which it would be desirable that the relations between the mine owners and the miners should be placed on the satisfactory basis of friendly relations and not confined in any inelastic strait-waistcoat, and he instanced, as an illustration, that during the time occupied by the necessary work for the reopening of the mines after stoppage, it was desirable that an arrangement should he made between the mine owners and the miners outside the terms of this Bill. The noble Marquess stated that he could not imagine that there would be any difficulty in the employer and the workman coming by agreement to such terms for the short period necessary on reopening. He went on to point out his great satisfaction that the relations had been uniformly friendly between the mine owners and the miners, and therefore in his opinion it was desirable that the miners should have reserved to them natural freedom of contract as to the wage up to the date of settlement in certain cases. The Amendment which I now move is necessary in order to give legislative effect to the views and wishes of the noble Marquess, and if it is agreed to I shall move the consequential Amendment standing in my name.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01456"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: May I say one single word in support of what has just fallen from Earl Grey. The noble Marquess who leads the House told us yesterday, what is perfectly evident, that the real desire of the Government is to get the men back to the mines, but the Government's desire is so strong that it seems to me they have only looked at one side of the question, because if men are to go down into the mines there must be mines for the men to go down into. As this clause stands, it seems to me very probable, indeed more than probable, that a great many owners will decline to open their mines until they know what the minimum wage is going to be, and for quite obvious reasons. There are many persons who have large contracts. Well, this Bill comes into force, the owner opens his mine, and the men go down and are employed, and the minimum wage is not settled for some weeks, for it is certain that in a great many cases you cannot have matters so intricate as this settled in a day or two; then the owner will find himself obliged to pay this minimum rate of wages right back from the date of the passing of the Act. As your Lordships have been told more than once, a great many mines have been working on a very small margin of profit, and it is probable that a great many of the owners may find that the increase in wages is such&#x2014;if it is to be anything like what we have been told in the other House; if it is to be a large amount&#x2014;that they will not be able to pay the wages, and then they will be obliged to close the mines. What will be the effect upon such an owner? He will have opened his mine, he will have employed the men, and he will then have found it impossible to employ them any longer and he will be obliged to close the mine. Therefore he will have had the expense of opening the mine and closing it for nothing. What will any prudent man do in those circumstances? He wall not reopen his mine until he knows what the minimum wage is going to be. I do not see how it can be otherwise. Certainly if I had anything to do with the mining industry I should not reopen my mine until I knew what wages I would be called upon to pay. There is another matter. I have never before heard of an arrangement being made retrospective by an Act of Parliament. The ordinary arrangement is, when wages have been fixed, or whatever the
<col>732</col>
matter is, that the change takes places from that date, and that is a certain date; but this provision introduces a great element of doubt and uncertainty into the matter. It seems to me that the clause as it stands is quite as likely to defeat the objects of the noble Marquess as to forward them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01457"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I am quite sure that the object of the noble Earl on the Cross Benches in bringing this Amendment forward was excellent, and I am also quite certain that neither he nor the noble Earl opposite desires to do anything which in effect would retard the opening of the mines; but the noble Earl on the Cross Benches, if he will forgive my saying so, does not seem to have comprehended quite accurately what I said yesterday. What I said was that there might be certain cases&#x2014;in my belief very few&#x2014;of mines just on the working margin, about which the owners might have some doubt as to whether they would be able to stand the district minimum wage and whether they would be able to open their mines at all; but I laid particular stress, or endeavoured to do so, on the fact that those mines must be exceedingly few in number, and I pointed out that if there were any such it would be possible for an understanding outside the Bill&#x2014;an understanding which, of course, would be bad in law&#x2014;between the owner who was anxious to open the mine and the men who were anxious to go down it, by which the extra cost of opening should be, so to speak, divided between the owner and the men by the latter not claiming the full minimum wage during the most expensive period. But, as I pointed out, those cases could only be exceedingly few, because they would be altogether outside the Act, and would depend upon the observance of an honourable understanding on both sides. The noble Earl on the Cross Benches apparently desires to make it possible in all cases to contract out of this provision. I believe that, as a matter of fact, the wording of the noble Earl's Amendment would take him beyond the mere retrospective period and would allow some different form of contract altogether, but I have no doubt he only intended to confine it to the retrospective period.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01459"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Has it occurred to the noble Earl that in endeavouring to induce owners to open their mines he would by this Amendment put into their hands, or conceivably put into their hands, a weapon of such power that it might have a general effect in preventing the men from going down the mines at all? The noble Earl's Amendment, if it were accepted, would allow owners to say to men who are quite willing to go down, and to go down into a pit of the character to which this particular fear of the minimum wage would not apply&#x2014;"I will not open my pit unless you make an agreement to accept something less than the minimum wage until such time as the joint district board can fix it." The effect of that would unquestionably be that all the men to whom that threat was made would say, "We will not go down until the rates have been fixed." Therefore the effect of the noble Earl's Amendment might be of a most dangerous and far-reaching character in preventing the resumption of work. I trust, therefore, that the noble Earl will agree not to press it. It would be most inconvenient if the miners were now led to believe that an Amendment carried in this House had the effect of making a plausible case for their refusing to go down the pits until the minimum wage had been actually fixed by the district boards, and I am entirely convinced that such might be the effect of the noble Earl's Amendment if it were carried. I therefore plead with him to withdraw it.</membercontribution></p>

Consequently the owners of those collieries in which this margin is so small would doubtless be acting rashly if they opened their pits before they knew what was to be the minimum sum which they would have to pay. There is another point, to which I drew attention last night&#x2014;namely, that the Insurance Act is going to put a heavy burden on collieries, and with the imposition of this minimum wage and the charges under the Insurance Act many of the collieries will have to be closed. Therefore owners will have to consider whether it is wise to reopen before they
<col>734</col>
know what the minimum wage is to be and with the certainty of having to pay a large sum under the Insurance Act when that Act comes into force. I notice that the noble Marquess stated that opportunity might be taken by the owners to refuse to open mines and keep the men out until they had made a satisfactory arrangement with them. As a coal owner myself I can say that we are only too anxious at any time to keep our collieries working. The annual expenses of working a colliery, independent of wages, are very heavy indeed. There are rents, way-leaves, and insurances, and these heavy annual expenses have to be paid whether hundreds of thousands of tons of coal a day are turned out or a considerably smaller amount. Therefore it is not the object of any coal owner to keep his colliery closed if he can get the men to go down. Further than that, coal owners are humane men, and they regret to see the suffering that takes place when there is a strike. The one object of the coal owner is to keep his colliery in full employment. For myself, I do not propose to do anything to retard the passing of this Bill. I do not think it will be the means of solving this problem, but I would be the last person to do anything to prolong the present state of affairs.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01461"><member>LORD ST. DAVIDS</member><membercontribution>: I think the noble Marquess opposite is right in thinking that the noble Marquess the Leader of the House has taken too sanguine a view when he states his belief that there are very few collieries working on a very small margin of profit. People outside the colliery business do not realise that there are quite a considerable number of collieries working, not at a small margin of profit, but at a loss. In conversation with a noble Lord the other day I could not get him to believe that there are many ordinary businesses in this country carried on for many years at a loss. Anybody who has in the course of his private affairs to study balance sheets of industrial concerns, flourishing and non-flourishing alike, must know that there are an immense number of concerns of that kind in this country that are carried on, some years at a big loss, some years at no loss, other years at a small loss or with a very small margin of profit. The coal trade is likely to be an exceptional one in that respect, because it costs an immense amount of money to equip a colliery, and if the
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0393"/>
<col>735</col>
colliery is carried on at a loss the owner does not want to lose all that money permanently; he therefore throws good money after bad, and is always hoping that a boom time will come when the price of coal will be sufficiently high to enable him to get his money back. I think the noble Marquess the Leader of the House has overlooked cases of that kind. It is difficult to know what is going to happen. In legislation of this kind, which I for one support because I think it is absolutely necessary, but for that reason alone, it is almost impossible to prophesy what is going to happen, but I do not think there is much risk that the pits will not be opened under this Bill. What I am afraid of is that a good many of them may not be able to be worked at a profit and will have to be closed. The reason they will be opened is this. The stores of coal in this country have been used up. I think that most concerns which use a large supply of coal will be in the habit in future of keeping larger supplies. It must take all the mines working at great pressure some months to come before they can produce the usual supply of coal that is needed and also make up the wastage that has gone on in the last few weeks. Coal has gone up to famine prices. Directly the mines reopen the price of coal will fall very rapidly, but it must be weeks and months, perhaps longer than months, before the price of coal can be down to anything like it was when the strike began. That being so, for the first few weeks after the pits are reopened the owners will make large sums of money, and therefore I think that even the weakest of the collieries will probably be opened, and opened hurriedly, in the attempt to make hay while the sun is shining. It is not concerning the present that I have any doubt, but as to the future. If some of the pits do close under this Bill, which is very probable, and if miners are out of work under this Bill, as I think is very probable, what will be the result? The result will be that the miners will come clamouring to Parliament for the repeal of this Bill, and that, I think, is a course which none of us will very seriously regret.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01462"><member>LORD NUNBURNHOLME</member><membercontribution>: Arising out of the remarks of the last speaker, I should like to appeal to the noble Marquess who leads the House to look forward to that period when this Bill will cease&#x2014;I refer to the end of the three years. Last night
<col>736</col>
we had a very good offer made to this side of the House by the noble Marquess who sits opposite. That offer was that after this Bill is through and the strike is ended, a step should be taken by all parties to see what can be done to get over the terrible crisis in the matter of strikes with which the country is threatened. I myself look upon this measure as only a temporary one. What many members would like to see done is this. We should like to see some coalition of the clever men of this country formed together, either in a Royal Commission or in some other way, to inquire whether something cannot be done to stop these disastrous strikes in the leading industries of the country. I think that could be confined to the three great industries&#x2014;the railway industry, the coal industry, and the transport workers. If some arrangement could be come to by which the men in those industries would not strike, the general trade of the country would not suffer so much in the future. Last night the noble Marquess opposite offered his co-operation to this side in any effort to bring about such a state of affairs, and I hope that the noble Marquess the Leader of His Majesty's Government in this House will take due note of that offer and accept it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01463"><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: I can understand why the minimum wage is to be made retrospective, and I fully appreciate the force of the noble Marquess's objection to Earl Grey's Amendment, but the fact that he has been able to make an effective criticism on that particular method of meeting the difficulty I venture to think scarcely goes far enough. The noble Marquess said that in his opinion the number of cases of mines that were working on such a narrow margin of profit that they possibly might not be reopened was very small. I would ask him. Can the Government give us any figures? Have the Government no knowledge, after all their inquiries and study of this question, which they can impart to us as to the number of mines that are working almost on a margin of loss? It seems to me rather curious that they should be able to give no information to the House in respect to that important matter. Then I would ask the noble Marquess whether I clearly understood his own suggestion. What I understood him to say was this, "There may be cases. I think very few,
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0394"/>
<col>737</col>
where mines would not pay to open at the minimum wage. In that case I suggest that the owner may make a private arrangement with the miner and pay a rate less than the minimum wage&#x2014;a private honourable understanding which would have no validity in law." Surely that is rather a remarkable suggestion to come from the representative of His Majesty's Government at a moment when we are considering the Minimum Wage Bill in Committee, because the first clause of this Bill enacts that it shall be an implied term of contract that there shall be a minimum wage; and lower down appear the words&#x2014;
<quote>"And any agreement for the payment of wages in so far as it is a contravention of this provision shall be void."</quote>
Therefore what the noble Marquess proposes is that an owner who is in doubt whether he can afford to open his mine at all should deliberately put himself outside the law and make an agreement with his workman which will not be binding in law, and which, for anything I as a layman know, may subject him to penalties. I do not know whether the Lord Chancellor could throw any light upon this and tell us what the position of an owner would be who made such an agreement in contravention of this Bill when it becomes an Act. I venture to think that though the noble Marquess may have made an effective criticism on the cure suggested by Earl Grey, his own is not one clothed in quite impenetrable armour.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01464"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I am anxious to make the position clear, as I understand it. It appears to me that there has been a certain amount of confusion arising out of the fact that two entirely different things have been under discussion. I fear I must have expressed myself badly, because both the noble Marquess opposite and my noble friend behind me (Lord St. Davids) suppose that when I mentioned a small number of mines which might be affected I was alluding to mines where the profit was small. I was not alluding to anything of the kind. I was alluding to the particular kind of mine in respect of which I understand the complaint was made to which I alluded yesterday&#x2014;mines working one or possibly two, very thin seams, very often of low priced coal, mines with a very small capital the owners of which were afraid of the extra expense of reopening that might
<col>738</col>
be incurred, whereas if they only knew what the minimum wage was going to be they would not think of opening their small concern at all. I was not at all speaking, as the noble Marquess and others seem to think, of mines where the margin of profit is small. I have known mines working between fifty and sixty feet of coal which have not paid for years, but those are not the mines the opening of which one way or the other would be affected by the minimum wage. I was speaking of the particular case of a very poor mine working a thin seam which the small owner who owned it might not desire to open, and I mentioned that in such a case I could conceive it possible that a friendly arrangement might be arrived at between the owner and the men that they would not claim arrears of what might be due to them for the minimum wage during the short period while the owner was put to the extra expense of opening. That particular point mentioned by me was an exceedingly small one. It obviously could not have any general application, and from that point the fixing of the minimum wage, whether it was fixed next week or not for a month, would have no effect upon the large concerns of the character of which the noble Marquess was speaking, some of which, no doubt, pay a great deal better than others. It is, of course, quite true, as my noble friend behind me said, that the coal trade is an extremely peculiar one in many respects, and not the least peculiar in the character of the returns it makes to the capitalist. Even the biggest and best managed mines pass through periods when they pay no interest on capital at all. Then come, perhaps, a few years when there is an ordinary and moderate return, and then perhaps every ten or fifteen years comes a great recouping year when, if the owner spreads out his gains, he finds that taking a period of fifteen or twenty years he has earned a reasonable percentage on his capital. I am only anxious to make it clear to the House that I was not at all speaking of the general profits of coal owners in allusion to this particular Amendment, but only to a very small and limited class of mines. I must repeat that the effect of the noble Earl's Amendment would go far beyond dealing with those particular class of mines, because it would offer no small inducement to many owners to attempt to make bargains with their men beforehand, and, what I regard as even more
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0395"/>
<col>739</col>
serious, it would be taken as offering an inducement to the men not to go down the pits until the minimum had been actually fixed. I appeal, therefore, to my noble friend not to press his Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01465"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD FABER</member><membercontribution>: This is a difficult question, and there is a great deal to be said on both sides. I listened with care to what fell from the noble Earl who moved this Amendment, and after he had finished speaking I think I was in favour of his Amendment. But I confess that, having listened to what fell from the lips of the noble Marquess, Lord Londonderry, as a business man I think the noble Marquess was correct. There is no doubt that in this country there is an enormous amount of money laid out in mines which is dead money if the mine is not working. Therefore it is essential that a mine owner, whether he can raise coal at a profit or not, should raise coal, because what he gets lessens the cost that is continually going on. Consequently I think it is unnecessary to proceed with this Amendment, because I feel practically sure that every man who has a coal mine, whether he is going to work the mine at a loss or at a gain, will start the mine as soon as he can.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01466"><member>EARL GREY</member><membercontribution>: The noble Marquess the Leader of the House has appealed to me to withdraw my Amendment. In doing so I would venture to point out that the noble Marquess's speech reminded me very forcibly of that hackneyed story of the housemaid who had an illegitimate child and excused herself because it was such a very little one. The noble Marquess has twice in the last few days counselled the coal owners to do what will be illegitimate under this Bill on the ground that, when it only refers to a small mine with a narrow seam, after all it will be quite excusable to break the law. I am a greater respecter of the law than the noble Marquess. I do not like that position. Where are you going to draw the line? When is the arrangement going to become an improper one which the noble Marquess on three occasions has stated to be a proper one? My object in moving this Amendment has been more or less realised. We are legislating under duress. I do not recognise anything in the nature of a free Assembly when we are discussing this Bill. We are obliged to accept certain provisions even though the noble Marquess the Leader of the House has
<col>740</col>
made a speech in favour of the principle of my Amendment. I only wish the speeches of the noble Marquess had as much legislative influence and force as the proposals for which he is obliged to be responsible as representative of His Majesty's Government in this House. He has pointed out that my Amendment goes too far. I do not pretend to be an experienced draftsman. I have not had so much practice as the noble Marquess. But if the noble Marquess wishes to put the men in the position he has described, not once or twice, but thrice&#x2014;I mean into a position which will enable them to contract themselves out of this Act without breaking the law&#x2014;I think it would be within his power to draft an Amendment of his own which will meet his own requirements.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01479"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I move to omit from subsection (1) of Clause 2 the words "and in settling any minimum rate of wages the joint district board shall have regard to the average daily rate of wages paid to the workmen of the class for which the minimum rate is to be settled." I am afraid that as no words appear on the Paper in the name of the Government I must recall your Lordships' attention to what happened in this House yesterday afternoon. The noble Marquess the Leader of the House, in moving the Second Reading of the Bill, got on to the discussion of the Amendments, and he told us very distinctly
<col>742</col>
of an Amendment which he said had been agreed between the parties, he believed, and was sanctioned by the Government and which he intended to propose to your Lordships when we went into Committee on the Bill. Then later at night the noble Marquess? old us that he had been misinformed, and that the Amendment was objected to by the miners, and he added that he hoped he would be able to find words which would satisfy both parties. I was in hopes that such words would have appeared on the Paper to-day, but, unfortunately, that is not so, and therefore I must call your Lordships' attention to the four lines which I propose to omit, which contain the arrangement that was placed in the Bill at a very late stage in the other House, and which I think under present circumstances it would be advisable altogether to omit.<lb/>
The noble Marquess told us yesterday that he regarded the Amendment inserting the words which I propose to delete as being of very little importance, and the Prime Minister, in accepting the Amendment, said exactly the same thing. These were his words&#x2014;
<quote>"I do not think that any joint district board which understood its functions would fail to take this average rate into account. I think that would be the very first thing they would take into account. How they could proceed to decide without taking that into account passes my comprehension. But if there is any apprehension on that point I can assure my hon. friend that the Government will be very happy to accept an Amendment of that kind."</quote>
That is precisely what the noble Marquess said here, and therefore it is quite clear that neither he nor the Prime Minister regards the words as being of any importance. But unfortunately it appears that both parties in this case regard them as of very great importance. The Amendment which was actually approved by the Government and foreshadowed yesterday was, I am able to say, also approved by the men. When the noble Marquess made his explanation late at night yesterday he said that he had made a mistake. But the noble Marquess had made no mistake at all. The Amendment had been approved by the men, it had been approved by the owners, it had been approved by the Government, and the Government had said that they proposed to introduce it into the Bill. If ever there was a <i>bona fide,</i> clear, unmistakeable Parliamentary undertaking, it was that. Now let us see what is the reason why the noble Marquess proposes to depart from
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0397"/>
<col>743</col>
this. He says that the men object to the Amendment. But the men had approved of it in the first place. Besides that, what <i>locus standi</i> have the men in this matter. Your Lordships will remember that the representatives of the men opposed this Bill in the House of Commons to the very extent of their power. They threatened the Government. They said, first of all, that they insisted on the insertion of the schedule. Then they fell back on the figures. But the Government declined to give way; and then the representatives of the men finally voted against the Third Reading of the Bill. After taking that course, what right have they to then demand further Amendments? Let me point out to your Lordships that this instruction is the only instruction in the Bill. The noble Marquess reminded us that the Government had been most anxious to be thoroughly impartial. He said they had been absolutely impartial between the men and the masters, and had treated both parties exactly in the same way. But these words which I move to strike out are believed by the men, whether rightly or wrongly I do not know, to be a strong point in their favour, and they are also believed by the coal owners to be a point against them. If that be so, and if the noble Marquess is of opinion now and if the Prime Minister remains of opinion that these words really are of no value, then I submit that the right thing to do is to remove them from the Bill. If the Government insist upon retaining them as they are in the Bill, it will be very hard indeed for them to think that the coal owners can possibly believe that they are thoroughly impartial.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01481"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I certainly have no complaint to make either of the substance or of the manner of the noble Earl's speech in putting forward his Amendment. His account of what occurred, so far as it relates to the part of His Majesty's Government in it, was a perfectly accurate one. I regret particularly that I should have misled the House as to the circumstances in which the Amendment was to be brought last night before your Lordships. The particular proviso which I had intended to move was, I believed at the time, accepted by both parties, and it was only in consideration of its being so
<col>744</col>
accepted that I should have moved it, because for reasons which I explained to the House I did not desire either to move or to accept an Amendment of any kind to this Bill, in the circumstances, which could be regarded as of a controversial character. There was a misunderstanding of the most genuine kind&#x2014;I say deliberately it was a misunderstanding of the most genuine character&#x2014;as to the agreement upon these words. The representatives of the men were under the impression, and we, I take it, gave them to understand, that the alteration of the words had no real effect in altering their meaning. They understood that the Amendment was, it is not too much to say, of a drafting character. But it afterwards appeared that there are on both sides among the owners and the men a certain number&#x2014;it is by no means, I think, a universal sentiment on either side&#x2014;who believed that the presence or absence of these words or the alternative form of words make a serious difference to what may happen when the district boards meet and have to fix the minimum.<lb/>
I must refer, by your leave, for a moment to what happened in another place with regard to these words, and how they came to appear in the Bill at all. What happened was that on March 22 Sir Arthur Markham, who is a Midland coal owner, asked, in the course of a speech, whether the Government would not give favourable consideration to the suggestion that the average rate paid to men in any county or district should be the minimum wage. He believed that if the average rate was paid, it would in a large measure accomplish what was desired by the men in moving the famous Amendment relating to the 5<i>s.</i> and the 2<i>s.</i> which was then under discussion. In the course of the same debate the Prime Minister said he would not in the least object to a provision being inserted in the Bill in appropriate terms that in settling the minimum regard should be had by the boards to the average daily rate paid for work of that class in the district. It is quite evident that in using those words&#x2014;I have no claim to speak for Sir Arthur Markham, but I assume his meaning was the same; I can certainly speak for the Prime Minister&#x2014;the Prime Minister was alluding to what is known as the day rate; that is, the rate paid to day men, and to getters or hewers on the occasions when they are not working at the face of the coal but are employed on some special work
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0398"/>
<col>745</col>
elsewhere; and it certainly never occurred to any of us that there was any colour whatever for the belief that, in speaking of the average wage, the daily earnings of the coal getters or hewers who work at piece-work would in any case be taken into consideration. That was entirely foreign to any idea of ours, and this, I think, is quite clear from what was said by the Attorney-General at a later stage. On the Report Stage in another place, if I may quote by the indulgence of the House, the Attorney-General said&#x2014;
<quote>"When dealing with minimum wages the joint district board must have regard to the average daily rate paid in that district to workmen of that class. That is what is intended, and that is what we thought the House had agreed to. It is certainly what the Prime Minister proposed, and I do think it is the fullest extent to which the Government can go. It will cover the case of the day men, and it will cover the case of the hewer. It will mean&#x2014;</quote>
and this is also important&#x2014;
<quote>"that when the joint district board has to consider this question of fixing a minimum rate it will not be bound rigidly by the average daily rate, but must take into account what is the average daily rate in the district."</quote>
Therefore it is quite clear that when this phrase was used the allusion was to what is known as the day wage and not to the average daily earnings, if you like so to describe them, of those who work at the face of the coal. And if further evidence is required it is supplied by this fact, that in another place an Amendment was actually proposed saying that the average rate should be the rate for the minimum and that the Government altogether refused to accept it; and I am able to say&#x2014;it comes to my private knowledge, and I will explain later why it is not public knowledge&#x2014;that at any rate some of the men (I am anxious to be perfectly candid in this matter and I do not know that they all agreed upon this) take precisely the view which I have indicated.<lb/>
The noble Earl drew attention to the fact that we do not consider this question as intrinsically an important one. What he said was perfectly true. If I were chairman of a district board&#x2014;and I do not speak without some knowledge both of the coal industry and of the coal trade&#x2014;I am quite certain that the ultimate minimum wage for a particular class which it might fall to me to fix in default of agreement between the two parties represented on the board would not be affected whether the words were in the Bill as
<col>746</col>
they stand or whether the words "prevailing day wage," which were the terms of the Amendment I had intended to propose, formed part of the Bill, or whether, as the noble Earl desired, the whole of these words came out altogether. From my saying this it certainly would appear as though I might accept the Amendment of the noble Earl. I do not believe myself, I repeat, that it is of really great moment whether either form of words is in or neither, but, as the noble Earl most accurately pointed out, that is not the opinion of some at any rate on both sides either among the owners or among the men. As I pointed out yesterday, there exists a singular attitude of suspicion, also on both sides, as to the making of any change or amendment in the Bill. It cannot be disputed that there are some of the men, though it is impossible, of course, to say how many, who believe that if the words "prevailing day wage rate" be used, it would prevent in some districts the raising of the lower scales of minimum for day workers which presumably might be raised under this Bill. It is also true that there are a certain number among the owners&#x2014;again I do not know how many&#x2014;who believe, if the words are left as they are printed in the Bill, that in fixing the minimum rate a number of considerations will be brought into play which I have explained it is not the opinion of His Majesty's Government can be brought into play&#x2014;and that is a deliberate opinion of ours which I desire strongly to impress upon the House in the most serious manner in my power.<lb/>
I had hoped that it might have been possible, if we could have met the representatives of both parties, that that atmosphere of suspicion would to some extent be cleared away, and that a formula would be found to which both parties might have deliberately agreed. That was impossible owing to the fact that the men's representatives have dispersed all over the country, and it was obviously vain to attempt to arrive at a conclusion unless it were possible to see both sides. I think it is possible that had the men's representatives been available we might have found at any rate some representatives of the coal owners who would have been able to speak on behalf of the trade as a whole. Consequently there is nothing for us to
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0399"/>

do but to leave the Bill in the form in which it came to us from another place. As your Lordships have been made aware from the Press, a ballot is being immediately taken asking the plain question whether the men will resume work or not. I do not think that anybody will say that the terms of that question are otherwise than perfectly fair, and I hope we may be sanguine enough to believe that there will be a good majority in the affirmative. But I am bound to say&#x2014;and in this I place myself entirely in the hands of the House&#x2014;that if the Bill were seriously amended here, or if it was believed to be seriously amended here, in the interests of the coal owners, I should look forward with some alarm to the possible effect upon that ballot. There may be&#x2014;I do not know that there are, but there may be&#x2014;a certain number among the men who desire to continue the strike and to postpone, perhaps for an indefinite time, the resumption of work. I believe those to be a very small minority, and it is because it is so important, I think, to keep them a small minority that I make the strongest possible appeal to your Lordships not to strengthen their hands in any way by giving colour to the belief that this Bill has been amended in this House adversely to their interests.<lb/>
If we believed that the Bill as it stands contained anything unfair, if we believed even that the joint district boards would, reading the words naturally, be bound to act in a manner which would be unfair to the coal owners, we might have to throw all these considerations to the winds, and I trust that in that case we should have the courage of our opinions. But, my Lords, holding the opinion we do, that the insertion of particular words or the omission of all the words are not in themselves and cannot prove to be a matter of substantial importance, we feel that it would be taking a terrible responsibility to make it possible for the men to believe that the Bill was being tampered with in a manner contrary to their interests. I cannot say how sorry I am that this misadventure should have occurred. As I said yesterday, I do not blame anybody for it, because I believe that it was a most genuine misunderstanding by those who took an actual part in it, and so far as I am concerned it was a simple piece of misinformation. But even in such circumstances it is very
<col>748</col>
painful to me to mislead the House, and I can only throw myself on the kindness and good humour of your Lordships and desire you to give all the weight that you will to the most serious appeal which I venture to make that you will not amend this Bill in this way and send it back to another place in a form which some believe, although I think wrongly, involves a serious alteration.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01482"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Many of your Lordships must, I think, have listened to the statement just addressed to us by the noble Marquess who leads the House with feelings of the greatest surprise, I would almost add with other feelings which nothing but our personal esteem for the noble Marquess prevents us from expressing. We have reason, I think, to complain, not only of the manner in which the coal owners have been treated with regard to this question, but of the manner in which this House has been treated. Let me, in half a dozen sentences, remind your Lordships of the history of this question. I am not going into the House of Commons history of the question. The noble Marquess gave us citations from debates which took place in the other House. What I am concerned with is the history of this matter in your Lordships' House. It was explained to us throughout that it was the intention of the Bill that these district boards were not to be hampered and limited by specific instructions. The Prime Minister's actual words were&#x2014;
<quote>"They were not to be fettered by directions."</quote>
As the Bill proceeded instructions were inserted in it. The noble Marquess referred to them last night very airily. He said they were merely sign-posts, and not of any great importance. I rather protest against the metaphor, because to my mind a sign-post is one of the few remaining institutions in this country to which I look with any amount of confidence and respect. But, my Lords, the obvious objection to putting sign-posts in a Bill of this kind is that if you insert sign-posts leading in a direction favourable to one of the parties, the other party will immediately ask to have another sign-post equally favourable to himself, and this process of setting up sign-posts is obviously likely to engender that feeling of suspicion with regard to the administration of this
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0400"/>
<col>749</col>
Bill which the noble Marquess has told us again and again he wishes to avoid.<lb/>
In this case I must say I think the coal owners were justified in regarding with a certain amount of suspicion the particular sign-post which was set up by His Majesty's Government. Avoiding technicalities, I will tell your Lordships in a word why I think that feeling was natural on their part. In the minds of most people the establishment of a minimum wage necessarily implies that there shall be an appreciable interval between that minimum wage and the amount which a skilled workman can earn by the full use of his vigour and knowledge of his work. That is a matter of the utmost importance, because it is in the existence of that interval, and in the existence of that interval alone, that you have an incentive to the general body of the workpeople to render an honest day's work for a full day's wages. What was believed, and to my mind not without reason, by the coal owners was that if you base your minimum wage upon the average daily rate of wages you tend inevitably to approximate your minimum wage much too closely to the full wage which an able bodied workman would find it possible to earn, and that you thereby wipe out, or nearly wipe out, that incentive to conscientious work to which most of us attach so much importance. His Majesty's Government were evidently at first fully convinced of the reasonableness of these misgivings, and the noble Marquess last night produced with considerable solemnity words which were intended to allay these suspicions, and they did allay them to a considerable extent. It is within ray knowledge that several noble Lords interested in the matter were reassured by the speech of the noble Marquess and left the House greatly relieved in their minds. Upon that the Bill was read a second time.<lb/>
Then very late in the evening we suddenly became aware that a complete change of front had taken place. The noble Marquess, at somewhere about eleven o'clock last night, announced to us that a misunderstanding had taken place, not, he thought, a very serious misunderstanding, but still a misunderstanding, and he suggested, I think very properly, that the debate might stand adjourned in order that in the interval His Majesty's
<col>750</col>
Government might have an opportunity of devising a formula of words to which both parties might agree, and it was upon that understanding that we separated last night. Well, my Lords, we come down to the House this evening and the noble Marquess gets up in his place to announce the failure of His Majesty's Government to make good their words, and the Bill, we now learn, is to remain as it stands with all its admitted faults still uncorrected. That places this House in a very serious position. I think we are hardly treated, and I think we are all the more hardly treated because we have made it clear on this side of the House that we had every intention of facilitating the passage of the Bill, and that we were unwilling to take any course which might obstruct its passage or prevent its becoming law immediately. The noble Marquess has made a very strong appeal to us. He has told us that there is to be a ballot of the men, and that in his view the immediate passage of this measure will make a great difference in regard to the results of that ballot. I am not prepared, and I think my friends who sit by me are not prepared, in the face of the appeal of the noble Marquess, to take upon ourselves action which might have the effect of delaying the Bill or even of risking the fate of the Bill, because I gather from the noble Marquess that there is no prospect whatever of my noble friend's Amendment being accepted and supported by His Majesty's Government in another place.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01484"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: That being so, we are face to face with this position, and we had better look it in the face. We may adopt my noble friend's Amendment, for which I think there is a great deal to be said on the merits, but, if we do, we must take the chance either of risking the Bill or of having the Amendment brought back to us tomorrow with a fresh appeal from the noble Marquess opposite, an appeal which the House probably would not be willing in the circumstances to resist. It seems to me, therefore, that, deeply as we regret the course which His Majesty's Government have taken in regard to this Amendment, we must accept, with all reluctance, the course which they propose to us. The
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0401"/>
<col>751</col>
only grain of comfort which I can find in the whole episode is this, that the noble Marquess has apparently satisfied himself that the clause as it stands does not carry with it the dangers which so many of the coal owners apprehend, and he tells us that in his opinion we may accept it without any misgivings. I confess that I take that only for what it is worth. I bear in mind that no Ministerial explanations really count for anything in the interpretation of an Act of Parliament, and that what we have to look to is the words of the Bill itself? and not the manner in which it is interpreted by the noble Marquess and his friends. At the same time I think the noble Marquess's assurance is, perhaps, worth something, because should it happen that this clause is found to operate in a manner which the noble Marquess and his friends do not anticipate, he will certainly be reminded of the explanations which he has given to the House to-night. I greatly regret, and so, I am glad to think, does the noble Marquess himself, that this episode should have taken place, and I repeat that I think the House has every reason to complain of the manner in which it has been treated by His Majesty's Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01485"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: I think every person, at all events every right feeling person, in this House must feel profound sympathy for the noble Marquess the Leader of the House in view of the singularly unpleasant position which he occupies at the present moment, an unpleasant position which I am sure he acutely feels himself. The noble Marquess in his speech said a good deal about there having been a misunderstanding. I venture to assert that there has been no misunderstanding whatsoever, and that the circumstances are perfectly plain. There has been no misunderstanding of any kind at all, but there has been a certain amount of gross intimidation. What happened was as follows. Yesterday morning the owners went to the Government's representative and put their Amendment before him for the consideration of the Government. The force of the Amendment was seen, it was accepted by the Government, and the representatives of the employers were informed that the men had no objection to it. So far, at all events, there was no misunderstanding whatsoever. In the afternoon the noble Marquess came down to this
<col>752</col>
House, and in the course of a long speech informed us that he intended to move the particular Amendment, and he gave his reasons at length for so doing. It is perfectly clear that up to that point there was no misunderstanding at all between anybody. But at eleven o'clock last night, after the Second Reading had been taken, the noble Marquess recounted his tale of a misunderstanding. Now I put it to anybody, Cannot any fool, anybody however stupid he is, see exactly what happened? After the noble Marquess had made his speech, after he had given his reasons for putting down his Amendment, and after having, unfortunately, explained it from his own point of view at too great length, the extreme people representing the Labour Party put in an appearance and said they would not have it, and thereupon the noble Marquess did what his colleagues so often do&#x2014;he "toed the line" and made a graceful concession to these gentlemen. When a bargain of this kind is broken&#x2014;and I assert deliberately that it was most emphatically broken&#x2014;what can you expect in the future? If you cannot get a definite undertaking from the Leader of this House, how can you expect any contract to be kept? This is one of those questions which deeply agitate Parliamentary circles but not the world outside. At all events, let us drop all this talk about a misunderstanding; and, bearing in mind what has been said by the noble Marquess, let us drop the contention that the Government have been, as they say, endeavouring to hold the scales evenly between the two parties, because it is obviously clear that they have been doing nothing of the kind and do not intend to.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01486"><member>THE EARL OF DUDLEY</member><membercontribution>: After the counsel that has been given to the House by the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition it is, I suppose, of little practical utility to continue the discussion upon the Amendment of my noble friend behind me, but as one who is considerably interested in this matter I should like to say that I have listened with very great regret indeed to the statement made by the noble Marquess, Lord Crewe. I for one certainly hoped that he would be able to redeem at any rate in some measure the pledge which the Government gave us yesterday that they would meet us on this matter. The noble Marquess has told us that opinion is strongly divided upon the words of this
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0402"/>
<col>753</col>
particular subsection&#x2014;that the miners on their side regard the retention of these words as an advantage to them, whereas the mine owners think that they may get disadvantage from their inclusion. That seems to me the very reason why the Amendment moved by my noble "friend behind me should be accepted.<lb/>
This clause adds or instils an element of partiality into this Bill, and in that way runs contrary both to the declaration and to the spirit of the declaration of His Majesty's Government. During the progress of this Bill in another place the Government told us again and again that they wished to be impartial in this matter, and that they recognised that Parliament was not a proper body to attempt to fix the rate of wages or to settle differences in these matters between masters and men. I believe honestly that they have attempted to adhere to that position. But this clause, by the sign-post to which the noble Marquess alluded, is to my mind a step contrary to the impartial attitude taken up by His Majesty's Government and for that reason I think that we as mine owners have every reason to protest against the inclusion of these words.<lb/>
But there are other reasons as well which make me think that these words should be omitted. I believe that they will add an element of great confusion to the work of the district boards. The noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition has very clearly pointed out the necessity of keeping what he called an interval between the minimum rate fixed for hewers and the maximum wage that they can earn by skilful and intelligent work. We believe that by the words of this clause the day rate of wages paid to hewers on day work will be confused with the rate fixed for piece work. The words of this clause say that in fixing the minimum wage cognisance should be taken of the daily wage rate paid to workers in that particular class. The fixation of any minimum rate would most certainly include the fixation of the rate for piece work, and if in fixing the rate for piece work the arbitrator has to take cognisance of the average daily wage earned by those men when doing day work an element of confusion is brought into this matter, and the interval which Lord Lansdowne says is so important will be reduced to almost vanishing point.<lb/>
<col>754</col>
The noble Marquess who leads the House assured us that this is not the intention of the framers of these words, and it may be that the arbitrator in whose hands our fortunes are placed may take that view of the case, but I should like to point out that we have no guarantee or safeguard that that will be so. We have no sort of security that the arbitrator will agree with the noble Marquess or even with the Prime Minister, and, if he does not, very serious consequences to us may ensue. I suppose that we shall have to accept this state of things, and that in view of the appeal which has been made to us by the noble Marquess who leads the House we shall have to hope for the best and rely upon the commonsense and justice of these arbitrators. But in view of the fact that the ballot of the miners is presumably not to be taken until next week, I fail to see why this matter, which is so important to us and on which so much discussion has taken place, should not have been settled during the two days that still remain of this week, and why the Government even by postponing the Bill twenty-four or forty-eight hours should not have attempted to redeem the pledge which they made. I must say I think the absence of the miners' representatives from London is by no means a convincing reason why this matter should be left in the present unsatisfactory state, and I for one deeply regret that we are not in a position to follow my noble friend into the Division Lobby on this Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01487"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: I should like to be quite certain that the House understands what exactly it is asked to do. Let us leave out for the moment the question of misunderstanding, or of whether this Amendment would or would not tell on one side or the other in future discussions. The grave matter, as it seems to me, which we are being asked to do as a legislative body is that, a possible misunderstanding being admitted, we arc; deliberately asked to take no steps one way or the other for the purpose of avoiding it. That is, that for a merely temporary peace we are asked to adhere to a form of words as to which it is admitted there is a difference of opinion as to their meaning, and whichever way that difference of opinion is decided it will lead almost certainly to friction and perhaps to litigation. Surely it is the absolute duty of those who are in a position to advise this House to endeavour to get us out of that, as I regard it, discreditable position.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0403"/>
<col>755</col>
It is commonly said that by the acceptance of Amendments here and there as a Bill passes through the Houses of Parliament the original intention of the draftsman is obscured, and when decisions are given, as they sometimes are, and probably absolutely rightly given, by legal authorities in a sense and in a way which it is obvious was not intended, the fault is laid on the Houses of Parliament and not upon those who at first promoted the measure. But here those who are responsible for the measure know of the difference of opinion, and yet deliberately abstain from taking any steps to make the matter clear. The position seems to me to be this. The arbitrator is directed to have regard to a certain state of things. I believe I am right in saying that the words which the noble Earl on the Cross Benches (Lord Grey) is going to move to insert into the clause later were originally in the clause and were omitted at a late stage in another place, and it is largely owing to that omission that the difficulty in which we are now placed has arisen. I hope the opinion expressed by the noble Marquess who leads the House is the right one, and that the arbitrator of the future will not be tied up by the inferences which may be drawn from this circumstance or from that, but I think it would be desirable that we should have, in addition to the expression of opinion on the part of the noble Marquess, some guidance from some one who has even better legal knowledge than he has himself. I think it would probably be wrong to ask that the Lord Chancellor should express an opinion on a matter which he may have to decide judicially, and I do not suggest it; but I am inclined to make an appeal to the noble and learned Viscount the Secretary of State for War as to whether he will take the responsibility of expressing the opinion that it does not much matter whether we accept this Amendment or not.<lb/>
I am not oblivious of the force of the appeal made to us by the noble Marquess at the conclusion of his speech, to take care lest we prejudice discussions and possible settlements which may take place in the country in the next few days. The noble Marquess who leads the Opposition powerfully supported that view. But supposing a decision is come to on the faith of an expression of opinion by their leaders that this clause as it stands does give the verdict in their case and the men find out that they have been misled, will that tend
<col>756</col>
to peace and to that settlement which we are appealed to not to do anything to prevent? I share in the desire of doing nothing which will prolong the unhappy misunderstandings and prejudices which now exist, but I fear that for the sake of temporary ease we are asked to take a course which will lead to greater difficulties in the future, when by a few days delay now and by facing our difficulties and doing our best like men we might come to a real decision which would have abiding force in the future. For these reasons I profoundly regret that this Amendment and the one which will be moved by the noble Earl on the Cross Benches are not in one form or other to be accepted by the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01488"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: As apparently no answer is going to be made to the suggestion from this side of the House, perhaps your Lordships will allow me to say a word or two with reference to the discussion. I deeply sympathise myself, and I am sure all the House deeply sympathises, with the noble Marquess the Leader of the House because we know that he is incapable of desiring in any way to mislead your Lordships or to give any information which is not fully accurate. I do not find fault with the noble Marquess. I do not impute blame to him in any sort of way. He did not intentionally mislead the House. He was misled, and then carried that information to the House which he was afterwards obliged to withdraw.<lb/>
But I confess that when we adjourned last night I was under the impression that there was going to be an attempt made to invent other words, but it appears that no such attempt has been made. That seems to me very strange. We are told that the miners' representatives had left London. I think the Government, after what they have done and after the assurances which they have given to the House that an attempt would be made to find words, should have made some attempt for themselves. The miners were not absolutely necessary to them. The Government surely might have endeavoured to alter the words in some such way as to make them less inconsistent than the words are as they now stand in the Bill. With regard to the answer which was made to me by the noble Marquess, I must confess I was very much surprised by it. His
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0404"/>
<col>757</col>
whole attitude in the earlier part of his speech was that he quite agreed with me. He stated that he did not attach much importance to these words, and he said the Prime Minister did not, and in the circumstances the natural inference was that he would agree to withdraw the words from the Bill. But what did he do in the later part of his speech? He said that although ho attached no importance to the words, the miners attached importance to them on the one side and the coal owners attached importance to them on the other, and he, being perfectly impartial, in consequence retained the words which pleased the miners and which displeased the coal owners. That was the entire substance of his argument as I understood it.<lb/>
I do not propose to detain your Lordships any longer. After the appeal made to me by the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition, I shall, of course, withdraw the Amendment, but I confess I think it would have been much better if the Leader of the House had acceded to my request. There is a story told of Sydney Smith to the effect that a man went to him and produced the draft of a book and asked him what he thought of it, and Sydney Smith said, "It is quite excellent, and there is only one suggestion I should like to make, which is that you should cut out every second word. You have no conception how that improves the style." That is exactly true of this Bill. If these words which I propose to cut out were excised and a great deal of the remaining part of the Bill as well, I am sure it would be a much better Bill than it is now. I beg to withdraw the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

I am grateful to him for recognising the very special circumstances in which I made the appeal. I have only to add, as regards the construction to be placed upon the words both in relation to the fears which I said were expressed by some coal owners that all the earnings of a particular class would be taken into consideration in fixing the day wage and also in reference to the particular point raised by the noble Earl below the gangway as to the operation of the words in affecting the minimum paid to hewers, that the opinion I expressed

The noble Earl said: My Lords, after the lengthened discussion on the Amendment moved by the noble Earl, Lord Camperdown, it will be quite unnecessary for me to take up much of the time of the House. I must confess I find it very difficult to swallow with patience the draught of humiliation which is being forced down our throats. We ask for justice, and we are told that because one of the two parties may be nervous as to the possible interpretation of instructions to the court of arbitration we are not to consider justice but what effect our action may have upon their feelings.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01492">Let me, in two or three short sentences, give you the history of the words which I am going to invite you to insert, and which I hope the noble Marquess will accept on behalf of His Majesty's Government, and, if not, I trust that the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition will not ask me to withdraw the Amendment. When the Bill was introduced it was a Bill to deal with the difficulty of "abnormal places." There was no instruction to the court fettering their discretion in fixing other rules or rates. After discussion in the House of Commons the sign-post which we have heard so much of was erected, but that sign-post carried the words which I ask your Lordships to put back upon it, and those words were put in by His Majesty's Government, I believe by the President of the Board of Trade, after full consultation, we may assume, between both parties. On the Report stage the words on the sign-post put on to please one party were retained, but the words "amongst other matters," which are the subject of my Amendment, were dropped out. I ask you to put back the words which were originally inserted by His Majesty's Government before their love of fairness was obscured by a desire to meet
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0405"/>
<col>759</col>
the prejudices of one of the parties to this dispute.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01493">Remember that the Prime Minister himself said that the chairman of the arbitration court is to be an independent and impartial person, and it is not desirable that he should be fettered with instructions. I regret very much that the noble Marquess was not able to accept the Amendment of the noble Earl, so that the court should be absolutely free from any instructions; but as that has not been the wish of His Majesty's Government we are now reduced to this Amendment which I have the honour to move. I maintain that as the House has decided that we cannot leave the court of arbitration without instructions, it is only right and proper that the court should be instructed to have regard, not only to the average daily wage&#x2014;which may be regarded as a positive instruction by some arbitrators to have regard to that and to that only&#x2014;but to have regard to other matters as well, and it is because I believe that this is only a common act of justice agreed upon by the House of Commons during one stage of the progress of this Bill through that House that I cannot help pressing the Amendment with all the earnestness in my power.<lb/>
I sincerely hope that the noble Marquess will accept the Amendment, which only restores to his sign-post the instructions which were at one time upon it. I would point out that in his speech last night about the sign-post the noble Marquess stated that the words upon it did not matter; it was not necessary to follow them. I do not like to say what passed through my mind upon that statement. When it fell from the lips of the noble Marquess I shared the profound pity to which the noble Earl and the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition have already given expression. I shared the profound pity which they felt for the noble Marquess, whom we all hold in great esteem and regard, when we realised what intense difficulties he was put to in endeavouring to play the <i>r&#x00F4;le</i> of loyalty to the Government of which he is so distinguished a member.</p>

The noble Earl knows what my view is as to the importance of any of these words in this particular connection, and therefore I cannot pretend that I consider the presence or absence of these words to be of any serious import.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01497"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I will explain. The position is somewhat different with regard to this Amendment from what it was with regard to the last, because the words "average daily rate of wages" were not formally objected to at all in another place. The Bill passed through the other House with those words in it. But these words" amongst other matters," proposed to be inserted by the noble Earl, formed the subject of a discussion, and I think I am right in saying of a Division, in another place. It is evident, therefore, that the effect of sending back to the House of Commons words upon which they had divided and by deliberation rejected would be, if anything, more of a challenge and provocation than the omission suggested by the noble Earl opposite of words which they had simply accepted without a Division. I have never been one of those who have complained, although as a member of the minority here I have often thought them somewhat unreasonable, of demonstrations which it was known would not have ultimate legislative effect when made by this House. I have often sympathised with the desire of noble Lords opposite to assert their existence in the face of another place, and to register votes and offer opinions although they knew that in a particular circumstance the ultimate legislative result would not be effective. As I say, I have never complained of that. But I do ask your Lordships to consider if this is precisely the appropriate moment for a demonstration of that kind. The
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0406"/>
<col>761</col>
noble Earl on the Cross Benches spoke, it seemed to me, somewhat airily of the possible effect of the insertion of an Amendment of this kind, and he seemed to consider that his demonstration was called for by the sense of the <i>amour propre</i> of the House. I can only say that I wish the House would take some less critical and some less&#x2014;I am not afraid to use the word&#x2014;dangerous occasion than this to assert its existence in such a manner. I can only, therefore, repeat the appeal which I made in connection with the former Amendment, that your Lordships will not send the Bill back to the other House with an alteration which it is known the other House will decline to accept.<lb/>
The noble Earl asked me why it was that we do not consider these words important. He will hardly maintain that an arbitrator, particularly one who is not acting judicially, is in at all the same position by being told that he is to have regard to certain figures or facts as he would be in if he were told he was to follow those figures or imitate those facts. All that the joint board will have to do will be to direct their attention, and clearly, whether you say it or not, they will direct their attention to this matter "amongst other matters.'' I confess that I shall be very much surprised if anybody would say that in effect, having regard to the character of the arbitration, those words are anything else but otiose. Regard will have to be paid to the particular day rate which is current in the district where the district board sits. That is my reason for saying, with all due deference to the great experience of my noble friend opposite, that the words are not of substantial importance, and His Majesty's Government do not believe that they will have practical effect on the figure of the actual minima which the boards when they sit will settle. It is our firm belief that the practical results will not be affected either by the absence or the presence of these particular words.</membercontribution></p>

We are,
<col>762</col>
however, in this position, that it is really of no use, in discussing these matters, to consider the question of merits at all. An argument based upon merits makes no impression whatever upon the noble Marquess and his colleagues. The position is simply this, and the noble Marquess has faced it, I think, with great frankness and courage. His Majesty's Government do not dare to ask their supporters in another place to accept any Amendment of this kind whatever case may be made in its favour. We are warned off any suggestions of this kind upon the ground that they imply what the noble Marquess called a moment ago a challenge and provocation to the other House of Parliament. It seems to me quite evident, from what we have been told by the noble Marquess, that we stand no chance whatever of getting this Amendment. All that will happen if we put it into the Bill will be that the Bill will come back to us with an intimation that the Amendment cannot be accepted. Your Lordships will then have to consider whether you will face a prolonged controversy between the two Houses on a comparatively minor point of this kind. My own opinion, I must say: in the face of the announcements which have been made to us twice this evening by the noble Marquess, is that there really is no use in pressing this point on His Majesty's Government, but that we had better accept the position, painful and humiliating as it is to your Lordships.</membercontribution></p>

I do not make any complaint about it but I should be very much surprised if those who are concerned in this matter pay great attention to the details of what is said in the course of discussion in this House. Committee discussions in this House are not always reported to the same voluminous extent as those in the other House of Parliament, which may or may not be an advantage.

At any rate I sincerely hope that the noble Earl on the Cross Benches will not withdraw his Amendment, but that at most we shall i negative it without a Division.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01505">The right rev. Prelate said: Coming from Wales, where the present trouble is so great and intense, I feel no apology is needed for my boldness in moving the Amendment which stands in my name. Indeed, the importance and necessity of such a proposal has been brought home very vividly to my mind during the present trouble. I believe that if such a proposal as this Amendment involves had already been part of the law of this country it would have been warmly welcomed by the colliers in my own neighbourhood, and I am not at all sure that if it had been in existence the trouble which has now taken place would have arisen in North Wales. I have lived among the Welsh colliers, and have followed closely for the last forty years every colliery strike in Wales. The North Wales collieries are all in my own diocese. The Welsh collier sometimes suffers at the hands of those who undertake to describe him. His occupation is portrayed sometimes in terms of romance and his character sometimes in terms of reproach. No doubt the risks and hardships of his occupation are exceptional, but his work is not unhealthy, his wages are
<col>764</col>
higher than those of most other workmen in the country, and his hours of leisure are larger and more at his command. The last forty years have seen steady and solid progress for the collier, alike in the conditions of his work and in his general surroundings. Much of that progress the collier has achieved for himself through combination. The awakening which education brings happily made him chafe at the discomforts and limitations which he bore contentedly in the days of his ignorance. No doubt some of the colliers are narrow and class conscious&#x2014;the same may be said of other sections of society&#x2014;but taken as a whole I venture to say they are brave, generous, and intelligent men, and respond as quickly as any other class in this country to appeals based upon reason and justice.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01506">The noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War said yesterday that in the ultimate resort we must rely upon the character and commonsense of our people. I believe that is our only and most substantial protection; and I am sure I shall command universal agreement when I say that in these complicated mining controversies, where the complexities are as numerous as the collieries themselves, it is of paramount importance that the free and unbiassed voice of the colliers themselves should be heard. If a demonstration in proof of that statement were needed, we have only to look around us to-day. The question of the settlement or continuance of this tremendous disturbance will largely be decided by the votes of the workmen which are to be taken in a few days. I suggest that there are three obvious conditions in the taking of such a vote to which no reasonable citizen can or ought to offer any objection. It ought to be a vote of all the workmen concerned in the mining industry. The absolute secrecy of the vote given must be assured, as well as the freedom of the voter himself. I think that every workman employed in and about the colliery, the fact of whose employment would be attested by the pay-sheet, should have the right to record his vote before such questions as those of cessation from work or resumption of work during a strike are decided. I have made inquiries, but have found it impossible to get accurate information on the point as to whether when a ballot is taken all the non&#x2014;unionists vote as well as the unionists. But if you take the votes recorded last January
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0408"/>
<col>765</col>
and compare the number with the number of people engaged in the collieries, you will find that only half that number really recorded their vote on the question whether or not there should be a strike.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01507">I come to the second condition. Reference was made last night by Lord Willoughby de Broke to the insufficient guarantee for the secrecy of the ballot as hitherto taken. So far from being secret the reverse is the case in Wales. The ballot paper employed renders it too easily possible for it to be known how the collier has voted, even if the collier after voting does not display in his buttonhole or in his hat the remaining half of the counterfoil, which proclaims how he voted. I do not desire to attach blame to any one, but I think it is obvious that these voluntary and unofficial ballots are open to many slips. The third point is almost too obvious to need any detailed statement. If the ballot is not secret the voter is open to many influences which may change his vote, if not his judgment, upon the question at issue. I have seen those influences at work; they are extremely powerful, and occasionally violent and unjust. I hope I have established firmly and beyond all controversy the necessity for securing that the ballot should be secret and free.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01508">The suggestion in the Amendment standing in my name has strong and recent precedents in its favour. Your Lordships will remember a ballot was taken after the railway strike for the selection of members on the Board of Conciliation, and that those ballot papers were returned to the Board of Trade to be by them, I understand, scrutinised and enumerated. But I will remind your Lordships of an even stronger precedent supplied by the Coal Mines Act of last year. That Act, in Section 118, provided that the Secretary of State might make rules for the procedure to be prescribed for ascertaining and certifying the views of the workmen in any mine on any subject upon which the views of any workmen were required. My proposal is only an extension of the principle already recognised in that Act. The adoption of the Amendment would give to the workmen the security of secrecy in recording their vote, to which they are entitled, and would afford to the whole community the assurance that in these great industrial controversies there was an opportunity of obtaining the free and unbiassed opinion of those
<col>766</col>
whose interests are most vitally concerned in these industrial problems. I cannot think that any reasonable person can take exception to the proposal which I have now the honour to submit to your Lordships. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01509">Amendment moved&#x2014;</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01510">Insert the following new clause:</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01511"><b>4.</b> If any question relating to the cessation of work or the proposed cessation of work in or about a coal mine for the purpose of altering or modifying the terms or conditions of employment is referred by any persons or association of persons interested to the vote of workmen concerned a ballot of all the workmen concerned shall be taken in accordance with regulations made by the Board of Trade and the Board in making such regulations shall apply, with such adaptations and modifications as may be necessary for the purpose of securing the secrecy of the voting, the provisions of the Ballot Act, 1872.&#x2014;(<i>The Lord Bishop of St. Asaph</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01512"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I am sure the House has listened with interest to the speech of the right rev. Prelate, who speaks from his experience of one particular part of the country. But I must remind the House that in relation to this particular Bill the right rev. Prelate's suggestion does not seem to be of a very practical kind, and for this reason. This ballot is beginning at once. It is quite clear that it would not be possible for the Board of Trade to make and issue, still less enforce, regulations with regard to this ballot, some of the papers for which, so far as I know, may be already in the hands of those who are going to vote, and obviously the Board of Trade could not circulate its regulations by tomorrow morning. I am not quite clear whether the right rev. Prelate's intention is that this provision of his should apply to all ballots connected with the coal trade, because if it is intended to do so it is surely outside the scope of the particular Bill which we are considering, and if it is only to apply to ballots relating to the minimum wage, it may, of course, be long, if ever, before such another ballot is taken again.<lb/>
But the fact is, the right rev. Prelate's suggestion opens up a very large question of general policy because it involves direct interference with the methods taken by a labour or trade association for its own purposes. Of course, if the State is going to issue regulations in respect of a ballot to be held by a trade, so that the ballot if held in the wrong way will be illegal&#x2014;and
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0409"/>
<col>767</col>
assuming the result of the ballot to be a strike, the strike presumably also would be illegal&#x2014;we then find ourselves in very close connection with the suggestion made by the noble Lord opposite, Lord Willoughby de Broke, that we are to have recourse to the proposals adopted in some of the Dominions by which strikes under certain circumstances may be declared illegal and penalties enforced in respect of them. Apart from that general question, if a strike is to be declared illegal on what is merely a technical ground in relation to the ballot, it would have to be most carefully considered who are the authorities connected with the union who are to be made personally responsible for the cost of the ballot and other similar liabilities. This seems, therefore, to raise the whole question of the ballots of trade unions, because this does not only apply in reference to miners, but to all other trades. The whole question as to whether the State ought to interfere by regulation with the methods under which trade unions take their ballots is one demanding close and separate consideration, and it is not possible, quite apart from the other considerations I mentioned in relation to the former Amendments, to incorporate in a measure like this a large and drastic change of that character.<lb/>
I do not wish to enter into the particular question as to whether miners' ballots are or are not more or less secret. As we know, even at a general election frequent complaints are made that the ballot is in some cases not secret, and, even more, that a large number of people believe it not to be secret, and their votes are thereby affected. As to what extent the secrecy of ballots in the case of the coal trade has been at different times violated, it is not, I think, useful to discuss at this moment. But in relation to the particular instance mentioned, I think among others by the right rev. Prelate, it is a somewhat remarkable circumstance that when the ballot was taken the other day on the very wide issue, "Are you in favour of the principle of the minimum wage, with the possibility of a strike following?" no fewer than 115,000 votes were cast "No," whereas in view of the general character of the question, had there been any extensive tampering with the votes of the kind which the right rev. Prelate indicated as occurring in some cases it is hardly to be supposed that the minority would have been, as it
<col>768</col>
proved to be, surprisingly large. But the right rev. Prelate will, I am sure, understand that we cannot accept his Amendment simply because we consider the subject is far too large a one for us to attempt to include in this comparatively small and special Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01513"><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I desire to say a word in support of the Amendment moved by the right rev. Prelate. Under the new Constitution the deliberations of this House are comparatively futile, but to-night we have reached the absolute limit of humiliation. If it is any satisfaction to the Radical Party to know it, their triumph over the Second Chamber of this country is complete. We know perfectly well what the fate of this Amendment, raising a most import ant question in connection with possible industrial legislation, is going to be. But there will be some slight consolation if the reporters think it worth while to record in the newspapers to-morrow the public service which the right rev. Prelate has performed in this crisis by calling attention to this exceedingly important matter of the ballot. I am not going at length into what I am credibly informed on the highest authority takes place in this matter. Noble Lords must have appreciated the restraint with which the right rev. Prelate expressed his views on this matter. But it may be interesting to state that I have in my hand a <i>facsimile</i> of a voting paper used for the purpose of determining a ballot, and I am informed&#x2014;I shall be very glad indeed to be contradicted by any noble Lord who has taken pains to inform himself differently&#x2014;that every single word which the right rev. Prelate has said with regard to these ballots is absolutely borne out by what actually takes place. The upper portion of the ballot paper which I hold in my hand is "For" any particular proposal, and the lower part "Against." The paper is perforated in the middle, and the miner who takes part in the ballot is supposed to destroy the half which he does not use. That, however, is not done. The custom is that the unused portion of the ballot paper is placed either in the miner's hat or in some prominent place, so that the miners' agent may know which way the man has voted. If any noble Lord is going to contradict this, and if I am satisfied that his information is better than my own, I shall most certainly with draw the charge that I am making&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01514"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: May I interrupt the noble Lord for one moment? I certainly should not be prepared to deny that the particular operation described by the noble Lord has taken place, but I should be surprised if I heard him assert that it was a universal practice in the taking of a miners' ballot.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01515"><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member><membercontribution>: My information is that this has taken place in more than one mine. This practice vitally affects the vote. But that is not the only thing with regard to the taking of these ballots. The papers are sent down from the headquarters of the Miners' Federation to the miners' agents at the mines. The miners' agent is placed in a position which I should be very sorry to be placed in myself, and in which I should be very sorry to see any of my friends placed in either. I should desire some safeguard. My information is that there is no check whatever upon the miners' agent. He is supplied with, or can manufacture for himself, an unlimited number pf these voting papers, and the number need not necessarily correspond with the number of miners voting at the ballot. There is no check whatever upon his proceedings, and I submit that that is placing the agent in a position in which no man ought to be placed. I feel quite sure that it is not a position which any man would really wish to be placed in. I bring no charge in this matter against the miners' agents or anybody taking part in conducting these ballots; though if the ballots are conducted from the same source that has treated the noble Marquess the Leader of the House in the abominable way in which he has been treated this afternoon, then I should not be at all surprised if we had proceedings of the same kind with regard to the taking of ballots.<lb/>
Some interesting figures appeared in the newspapers this morning with regard to the strike ballot which was taken in January. It appears from a Parliamentary Paper that the number of underground workers is 863,000. The membership of the Miners' Federation is between 600,000 and 700,000. But of the 863,000 underground workers in the country only 561,000 recorded their votes in January last. The noble Marquess on the Front Bench produced an argument which in a certain sense&#x2014;I say this without any
<col>770</col>
desire to be impertinent&#x2014;is rather ingenious. He said that supposing the practice to which I called attention had obtained in certain cases, the fact that there was the very liberal allowance of 115,000 "No's" showed that the ballot was on the whole above suspicion. I cannot help thinking that if the noble Marquess had given us his own view or perhaps the view of the Government on the general ethics of a secret ballot, he would have satisfied a great many people. I know we shall be told that it is impossible to dissociate a ballot taken with regard to a strike from any other <i>quasi</i> private ballot like that which is taken for the membership of a club. But these ballots will have to be taken in the future among the <i>employ&#x00E9;s</i> of the country on matters exceedingly vital to the State, quite as vital as a General Election, and it is not extravagant to ask His Majesty's Government to let us have their views as to whether it is not at least as important to secure and safeguard the secrecy of the ballot with regard to great industrial questions as it is to safeguard the secrecy of the ballot as far as we are able to with regard to Parliamentary elections&#x2014;not only in the interests of those who take part in the ballots, but in the interests of the miners' agents themselves, who are bound, owing to the freedom which is now placed in their hands, to lay themselves open to some kind of suspicion in this matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01516"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I think the House is indebted to the right rev. Prelate for having called attention to this most important subject. It is one with which I feel convinced Parliament will sooner or later have to deal. The abuses which arise in connection with these miners' ballots are notorious. I have seen properly authenticated statements which leave no room for doubt that in many cases the ballot takes place with insufficient precautions for secrecy, and that the men who vote are not sufficiently protected from pressure and intimidation. There is another point upon which I think the right rev. Prelate did not touch, but which I venture to think requires some attention. I believe it is the case that at these ballots not only the men but also boys of sixteen years of age vote. It does seem to me extremely doubtful, considering the enormous gravity of the issues which depend on the votes taken
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0411"/>
<col>771</col>
on these occasions, whether it is right that 200 or 300 young lads should be placed in a position to determine the issue of the vote. It must be pretty obvious that to lads of that age a strike means, in the first instance, a few days' holiday with all its attractions, and for that reason alone it seems to me doubtful whether they should be allowed an equal voice with their seniors.<lb/>
I am, however, bound to say, after listening to the speech of the noble Marquess opposite, that it would not be easy for His Majesty's Government to deal with this question within the compass of the present Bill. I know that some of the noble Marquess's colleagues think that there is nothing in this matter at all. The Prime Minister said the other day, in reply to a Question, that these ballots were the concern of his fellow-countrymen and that his fellow-countrymen might very well be left to manage their own affairs. It seems to me that in transactions of this kind it is very desirable that those who take part in this voting should receive the kind of guidance which the right rev. Prelate desires they should receive from rules and regulations issued with the authority of a Public Department. However, the noble Marquess, I think with truth, says that the question is somewhat outside the scope of this Bill, and he added, I think with irresistible force, that whatever view be held upon that point it is quite impossible that anything can be done that would affect the ballot which is probably in progress at this moment in certain mines. I therefore counsel the right rev. Prelate to be content with this discussion and not to press his Amendment, but I confess I should have been glad if he had been able to extract from His Majesty's Government some kind of assurance that they would look into this question with a view possibly of dealing with it at some future time. I also venture to express my concurrence with what the right rev. Prelate told us when he said that in many cases the miners themselves would be the first to welcome the kind of protection which would be given to them if a procedure of this kind were adopted.</membercontribution></p>

Some of us on this side of the House have criticised His Majesty's Government and have criticised the Prime Minister because they completely passed over without comment a matter which we think gives a very serious aspect to this controversy, in that contracts deliberately entered into for a specific purpose and for a definite time have been torn up by one of the parties concerned, and treated as if they did not exist at all. It has, however, been left for the noble and learned Earl on the Woolsack, not only to pass this over in silence but actually to use words condoning and excusing and, I venture to think, almost defending this new morality which I regret seems to find favour with some persons in dealing with

<col>775</col>
our public affairs. The Lord Chancellor will forgive me if I quote from his remarks yesterday. I can only quote from <i>The Times</i> report, and if it is incorrect the noble and learned Earl will, of course, correct me. But the noble and learned Earl is reported in <i>The Times</i>&#x2014;and as far as my recollection goes it is fairly correct&#x2014;to have said last night&#x2014;
<quote>"We are told we have broken contracts. We may assume that this Bill may involve the breaking of contracts. It seems to be forgotten that contracts were broken in Ireland in 1887 when the fair rent court was set up for one class of tenantry, and that by the extension of that Act in 1887&#x2014;</quote>
there must be some mistake in the report in regard to the years&#x2014;
<quote>"by a Conservative Administration to leases, all leases were broken. Is it fair then to turn round now and say 'because you are breaking contracts that is a conclusive argument against the Bill'?"</quote>
I venture to say that the Lord Chancellor is inaccurate first of all in what he says is our charge. We do not say that it is a conclusive argument against this Bill that it may involve the breaking of contracts. That is not the point at all. What our charge has been, and is, is that after contracts have been entered into deliberately, after long discussion and grave differences of opinion upon certain specific points and after having been solemnly ratified by both parties concerned, negotiations have been entered into by His Majesty's Government with the intention of relieving to a certain extent one of the parties concerned in those contracts who imagine they have a grievance, and that they entered into those negotiations without any protest whatever or rebuking those who, when more than half the time of these contracts has to run, deliberately tore them up and threw them on one side. I cannot imagine why the Lord Chancellor thinks that the instance of the Irish Land Acts is analogous to this in the slightest degree. We know perfectly well that Bills have to be brought in and passed which interfere with contracts when it is in the interests of the State and of the country that certain legislation should take place even though it may involve this. In the case of Irish land the Acts referred to interfered with contracts that were of long continuance or were constantly renewed, based upon the custom of the country, and in those cases we had arrived at a point when, in the view of the Government of the day, for the sake of justice it was
<col>776</col>
necessary to pass legislation which involved the breaking of these contracts.<lb/>
But this is an entirely different thing. It is not the Bill which is breaking contracts or allowing persons to break contracts. The contracts were broken before the Bill was produced, and we now arrive at this position&#x2014;that, as I say, a code of morality is condoned and excused which could not possibly be excused if the action related to affairs which had taken place between individuals in their private life. It is idle to say that confidence can exist between Capital and Labour, between masters and those who are employed, if on one side or the other contracts deliberately entered into&#x2014;and in this case in a trade which depends on making contracts which have to run for a considerable time ahead&#x2014;and solemnly ratified can be torn up and treated as if they had been non-existent; and I venture to say it is a very serious matter for the country if the Government, whatever Government it may be, takes action such as has been taken at present, with an excuse upon their lips for breaches of agreements such as have taken place in this case.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01545"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF PLYMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: I regret of course, that I did not give any notice-to the noble and learned Earl.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01546"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: There is no occasion, however, for any deliberation. As far as I can recollect, the quotation which the noble Earl has made is an abbreviated report of what I said and puts shortly the substance of longer remarks, not very long, which I did make in the House and to which I entirely adhere. I have not had an opportunity of seeing any copy of what I said, and, of course, when speaking in debate late in the evening and trying to condense it may be that I did not express myself clearly. But I will tell the House what
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0414"/>
<col>777</col>
I then said, and explain exactly what I mean. There were two subjects which I thought at the time that I spoke had been somewhat mixed up in the discussion. One was the complaint that the Bill interfered with freedom of contract by imposing a minimum wage. The other was a statement that the Bill condoned in some way breaches of contract that had already been made&#x2014;that is to say, gave sanction to the tearing up of contracts made by parties who were entitled to make them. As to interference with freedom of contract and with the liberty of people to make contracts, I said, and I repeat, that the industrial law of this country was full of such prohibitions. I could give instance after instance in which the Statute says that in the public interest parties shall not be allowed to make contracts of a particular kind because they are against the public interest and ought not to be allowed by the law as far as they conflict with the public interest. I do not know that any member of the House will be disposed to differ from that or to say that the liberty of the individual to make any contract he thinks proper, however deleterious it may be to the community at large, ought to be maintained without qualification.<lb/>
The second proposition was whether this Bill condoned or led to a violation of existing contracts, which is a perfectly different thing. It is that latter part to which I understand the noble Earl intended to refer in the observations he has made. Upon that I believe I stated to the House that it is disputed as to whether or not there has been any breach of contract. I do not pretend to say whether it was the case or not. I said it is disputed. Thereupon I made, according to <i>The Times</i>, this statement&#x2014;
<quote>"We are told we have broken contracts. We may assume that this Bill may involve the breaking of contracts&#x2014;</quote>
That was not my language. I stated that it was a disputed point, but that I would assume that it was so for the sake of discussion. According to <i>The Times</i> report I then proceeded&#x2014;
<quote>"It seems to be forgotten that contracts were broken in Ireland in 1887&#x2014;</quote>
the year I stated was 1881&#x2014;
<quote>"when the fair rent court was set up for one class of tenantry, and that by the extension of that Act in 1887 by a Conservative Administration to leases, all leases were broken."</quote>
<col>778</col>
I did use language to that effect, and the noble Earl has not; denied that it is true. Every one knows that the fair rent court was imposed in lieu of existing contracts, and the noble Earl will not dispute that the fair rent proposals were applied to leases in the year 1887. That meant, not that all leases in Ireland were broken, but the leases of long duration, and there were great numbers of them, which had been made between the parties were broken. Do not let us enter into a discussion of the merits of the Irish land legislation. I was not speaking of the merits of the Irish land legislation, but gave that as an instance of what had been done. And then I added&#x2014;
<quote>"Is it fair, then, to turn round now and say 'because you are breaking contracts that is a conclusive argument against the Bill'?"</quote>
Those are the impugned words. I repeat that it may be necessary at times, though I admit it is a step which should be taken rarely and only in great difficulties; but it is not fair to say that because you are breaking contract? it is a conclusive argument against the Bill. Though it is most undesirable to impair in any way individual freedom, it is sometimes done, though reluctantly. It is still more difficult and objectionable to make a law which has the effect of breaking contracts that have been made, but even that may under the stress of necessity be necessary. There is no analogy at all between Irish land and Welsh or English coal, but the principle is identical. In both cases the severance of a bond existing by contract between different people is most undesirable, but in either case it may be imposed by necessity, and, as I have said, it has been done by Liberal and Conservative Governments in cases of special necessity. That is all I have to say. I should like to have been able to say it clearer and better, and certainly shorter, as I should have been had the noble Earl thought proper to give me notice that he was going to call attention to the matter.</membercontribution></p>

<col>779</col>
hear any more of further measures. I hope that will not be the ease. In the course of this debate allusion has been made to several measures which require consideration. There is the picketing question, the operation of the Trades Disputes Act, and the important question to which the right rev. Prelate alluded a short time ago, and which I was glad to hear the noble Marquess say the Government would consider. All these are matters which the country thinks the Government should take up in a broad and statesmanlike spirit, with a view, if possible, of devising some remedy for the present state of things and preventing a recurrence of the events of the last few weeks. No one wishes to act in a hurry. We have suffered from hurried legislation. The trouble we have been in during the last few weeks is largely due to that unfortunate Eight Hours Act which was passed, though many of your Lordships opposed it, in much too hurried a way. I should have been glad if in the course of this debate the noble Marquess the Leader of the House or some other representative of His Majesty's Government had stated that they fully realised the importance of doing something more than this Bill, and would take the matter up either by themselves or by Royal Commission. That is what the country wishes, and if His Majesty's Government will take the whole matter into consideration in that spirit they will receive the assistance of sensible men both inside and outside this House, no matter to what Party they belong.</membercontribution></p>

The Irish Land Act of 1887, as the noble and learned Earl well knows, was not passed because the leaseholders had repudiated their engagements and come to Parliament to ratify that repudiation, but it was passed because, in the opinion of Parliament, an interference made with contracts years before had placed those leaseholders in a position which entitled them to be relieved. That came under the first of the noble and learned Earl's propositions, which was that there were cases in which Parliament did interfere with contracts in the public interest. But what is most unfortunate is that the idea should go out that in this House the noble and learned Earl who is at the head of the law quoted as a reason for absolving these men the fact that Parliament had interfered with contracts under other conditions&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

There is no limitation in those words. Those words apply, and have been taken to apply, and have been felt outside to apply, not merely to the fact that Parliament does at times interfere with contracts, but that they did interfere with a contract specially made under Government arrange-

ment a year or two ago, which contract has been broken and repudiated, and the repudiation of which is brought before this House for ratification. I venture to say, in regard to the history of land legislation in Ireland, that although there were many cases in which Parliament interfered because trouble had arisen, the question of the leases in 1887 was not one of them. It was, if you like, an act of grace by Parliament. It was not a reward by a Conservative Government to those who had broken the law. I am sorry that the noble and learned Earl resents what has been said from this Bench, but I think we are indebted to my noble friend Lord Plymouth for having made this matter rather more clear and having pointed out the laxity of the language of the noble and learned Earl which has led to misunderstanding.</membercontribution></p>

I think there must be some misapprehension, because the Prime Minister distinctly said that an opportunity would be given to Parliament to discuss the matter before the Government was finally committed to the new Convention. It is extremely desirable, if there is such a misapprehension, that it should be removed in order that a false impression may not go forth to the world.

The statement which appeared in <i>The Times</i> probably referred to the fact that a Protocol was signed by the various Powers giving leave to Russia to increase her export of sugar up to the year 1915. This Protocol was not signed by the British representative on the ground that

we had in no way been parties to the limitation of Russian exports, and therefore we had no objection to offer to the Protocol referring to exports either in this year or in subsequent years. But the position really is that His Majesty's Government is in no way committed to remain a party to the Sugar Union after September 1, 1913, and I may further say that the Prime Minister has distinctly stated that before this question is settled one way or the other a full opportunity shall be given to Parliament for a discussion upon it.</membercontribution></p>

But if it refers to charges imposed by law upon the land of Wales to be administered by the officials of a State religion, not merely for their own maintenance, but for purely secular purposes, such as the maintenance of the poor, the healing of the sick, and the education of the community, then the legislative power that imposed the charge, created the trust, chose the trustees, and declared the objects of the trust has a right either to restore its original purposes or to vary them, to change, if it will, the trustees, and even, if it so think fit, to abolish the charge altogether"</quote>

Wilson on Welsh Disestablishment, used words which implied that the charges upon land for the use of the Church had been imposed by the Legislature, and the Home Secretary, in a speech, spoke of tithes being created by law. I venture to ask that we may be given particulars with regard to those Acts of the Legislature which are alleged to have imposed those burdens. I submit, my Lords, that tithes have been for ages past an obligation on the part of Churchmen which it was their custom to fulfil, that they received the sanction of the Ecclesiastical Law, but that they were never in any sense part of the public revenue. It is true that the sanction of the Legislature was added to that of the Ecclesiastical Law, and it may be said that the Legislature regularised the form of the collection of tithes; but, even if this is said, that cannot be in any way translated into a statement that tithes were created by law or that charges were imposed on the land for Church purposes by the Legislature. Tithes were really the voluntary gift of Church people, and come under the first hypothesis in the statement contained in the preface written by Mr. Lloyd George. I do not desire, in asking these Questions, to take your Lordships back into ancient history with regard to the controversy which ranges round the question of the administration of tithes for the use of the poor. I simply content myself by asking that we may be given the reference to those Acts in which Mr. Lloyd George alleges that tithes were directed to be administered for the use and benefit of the poor. Of course, the poor have benefited by the tithes in the sense that the clergy who have enjoyed
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0419"/>
<col>787</col>
the tithes have of their voluntary generosity and out of their means assisted the poor always to the best of their ability. But I am anxious that we may be given the Act by which the Legislature is said to direct that tithes should be administered in this manner.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01592">There is only one other point to which I wish to refer to-day, and that is to the statement of the Home Secretary, who, in speaking of disendowment, said that the income of the Church in Wales "sprang from ancient endowments and Parliamentary grants." I ask that we may be given particulars of those grants. The Legislature has given grants in times past the total amount of which is not large, but those grants were given to assist in the erection of churches for the use of the Church of England, and I believe also of the Church of Scotland. It surely cannot be said that such grants in any way form part of the income of the Church in Wales. I hope that to-day we may receive further information with regard to the statements which have been made. This controversy with regard to the Church in Wales is undoubtedly at the present moment exciting the deepest interest throughout the country, and it is, I submit, in the public interest that the arguments upon which such statements are based should be set out clearly and in detail; and I venture to think that this is even more important when the statements are made, not only in speeches, in which perhaps words are sometimes rather more lightly used, but in a written preface, which must therefore be considered to contain the carefully-thought-out opinion of the writer&#x2014;a preface which has been widely read throughout the country, and to which attaches the weight which is naturally given to the opinions of a Cabinet Minister. I beg to ask the Questions which stand in my name.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01593"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (THE MARQUESS OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: The noble Viscount has, I think, taken a somewhat unusual course, though a course of which I do not complain, in placing this Question on the Paper in this form. I understand that he objects to certain statements made by my right hon. friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the preface to a book written by Mr. Wilson. If the noble Viscount objected to those statements,
<col>788</col>
there were two natural and ordinary courses open to him. The first was himself to write a book or a preface to a book in reply to those statements, disposing, if he could, of the statements of fact which he considers inaccurate. The other course, also a natural course, would have been to wait until the Bill in due course reaches your Lordships' House, when all these controversial questions will no doubt receive very close examination. The Question which the noble Viscount has asked does not in its various parts relate so much to questions of fact as to questions of opinion and the reading to be given to particular historical facts&#x2014;facts, again, as to the very existence of which different parties are not precisely agreed. I think we may assume, therefore, that in taking the course he has the noble Viscount had in view rather the obtaining of some controversial advantage in this matter than the mere obtaining of information, because I am quite sure that he would be the last man in this House to invite His Majesty's Government to supply him or the House generally with historical or other facts which it is open to anybody to obtain for himself by reading well-known works on the subject.<lb/>
In effect, the noble Viscount asks four different Questions, and the fourth relates to the same subject as the first. He asks, first, for a reference to the legislative Act which imposed as charges upon the land of Wales those endowments of which His Majesty's Government propose to deprive the Church in Wales; and in the last paragraph, referring to a statement by the Home Secretary, the noble Viscount asks for a reference to the law which created tithes in Wales and in what circumstances and in what year it was passed. The noble Viscount is quite accurate in his facts when he states that during a long period tithes in Wales, as in England, were exacted under the Ecclesiastical and not under the Civil Law. They were exacted under the Canon Law in Wales after the absorption of the Welsh dioceses by the Province of Canterbury in the early part of the twelfth century. Up to that time there is, I believe, no evidence that tithe was paid at all except as an occasional offering to parochial incumbents, or indeed to any ecclesiastical authorities in Wales. In the old ecclesiastical records of Wales there is no mention to be found at all of the payment of tithe, except on special occa-
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0420"/>
<col>789</col>
sions, before the twelfth century. Then the payment of tithes was enjoined by Ecclesiastical Law. But it is important to remember that from a very early time Ecclesiastical Law was enforcible in fact by the Civic authority, and that consequently, although the law was ecclesiastical the sanction was to a great extent a Civil one. It was a fact that from the beginning of the Norman Conquest payment of tithe would be enforced, if necessary, by the Civil power. The noble Viscount is also quite right in stating that the final legal sanction for the payment of tithe did not come till very much later&#x2014;did not come, in fact, until the years of the tremendous enforcement by Cromwell of the Royal supremacy as against the supremacy of Rome&#x2014;the years 1530 to 1540. It was in one of those years, I think in 1535, that the payment of tithes became a civil obligation in England, and two years later it became an enforcible civil obligation in Wales. Therefore the noble Viscount is technically quite accurate in stating that before those years of the enforcement of the Royal or Civil supremacy over the Church the payment of tithe was not an obligation by Act of Parliament.<lb/>
Next, the noble Viscount asks for a reference to the Legislative Act or Acts in which directions are to be found that the charges so imposed were to be administered for the maintenance of the poor, the healing of the sick, and the education of the community, as well as for the maintenance of the clergy. It is important to point out that the Chancellor of the Exchequer does not say that there was a legislative direction. The effect of his observations is that there was, by this legislation, an endowment of the persons whose practice for ages past and whose duty it had been to do the particular things which the Chancellor of the Exchequer mentioned. It is accurate, I think, to state that tithe in Wales was not actually charged&#x2014;for instance, to take one case, with payments for the exercise of educational functions; but, as a matter of fact, those who received tithe, in Wales in particular&#x2014;to a great extent the monastic foundations&#x2014;did expend a substantial part of their revenues in education, they being at the time practically the only people who carried out any education at all. That is to say, tithes formed an appreciable part of the income from which educational duties were carried out by
<col>790</col>
those who received them. The case of the relief of the poor is a stronger one, for it is, I think, believed by many of those who are the best authorities on the subject that the payment of tithe was in fact distinctly charged with poor relief, because except for the quite casual donations which were made by individuals for the relief of the poor, and particularly of the sick poor, there was no provision at all other than that from ecclesiastical sources for their relief.<lb/>
The third and last Question, because I have already dealt with the fourth in speaking of the first, relates to the statement made by the Home Secretary, in a speech at the Queen's Hall, that the income of the Church in Wales "sprang from ancient endowments and Parliamentary grants." There I might refer the noble Viscount to the Return of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners and of the Governors of Queen Anne's Bounty made by them to the Royal Commission on the Church of England and other religious bodies in Wales, which gives a list of the various endowments. But the Home Secretary informs me that in using the term "Parliamentary grants" he was referring to the Welsh share of the eleven grants of&#x00A3;100,000 each made in the early part of the last. Century&#x2014;between 1809 and 1820&#x2014;to the Governors of Queen Anne's Bounty under the authority of the annual Appropriation Acts. The Church in Wales, as the noble Viscount will be aware, still receives a sum which, though not a large one, is a perceptible sum&#x2014;nearly&#x00A3;6,000, I think&#x2014;from this source. The noble Viscount will find those figures in the appendix to the Report to which I have referred.</membercontribution></p>

I hope that, so far as the limited character of the present discussion permits, I have now answered the four Questions put to me. I think the noble Viscount, and the House also, will probably agree that it will be better to defer any attempt at a general discussion of these difficult and complicated questions, some of them historical, some almost archeological, upon which a marked difference of opinion no doubt exists. But I shall be glad if the information which have been able to give is of any service to the noble Viscount in pursuing his researches.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0421"/>
<col>791</col>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01596"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I quite agree with the noble Marquess that the present is not a convenient time to discuss the merits or demerits of proposals which have not yet been laid before Parliament, or even to go at length into the historical questions which will necessarily be raised when those proposals are before your Lordships' House. I also admit that the course which my noble friend has taken in asking these Questions is perhaps a little unusual, but I submit that he was abundantly justified, because the course taken by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and by the Home Secretary was also unusual. For what did they do, and what is their position in this matter? The Chancellor of the Exchequer is not only in virtue of his office one of the most important members of the Cabinet, but it would not be, I think, inaccurate to say that in this particular matter of the relations between the State and the Church in Wales he is the protagonist in the Cabinet of the views which the Cabinet will put before the country when they bring in their Bill; and the Home Secretary is the Minister who, as I understand, is actually to be in charge of the Bill when it is introduced into the House of Commons. These two important Cabinet Ministers, one in a preface to a book and the other in a speech, laid down what I may call an historical basis for the proposals that they were later on going to make, and the service which my noble friend has done has been in drawing the attention of this House and through this House the attention of the country to the nature of that historical basis.<lb/>
I would not for a moment suggest that either of these two right hon. gentlemen said or wrote anything which he did not believe to be literally accurate, but I do say, and I say it without hesitation, that they were careless in not assuring themselves of the validity of the authorities on which they based their historical statements. What were those historical statements? They were statements so strong and so distinct as to form, if valid, an adequate foundation for any Bill. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that some of the charges resting on the land in Wales for the benefit of the Church in Wales had been imposed by a legislative Act, and he went on to say that the same authority which had imposed those charges by a legislative Act was obviously competent,
<col>792</col>
if it thought proper, to vary or annul those charges or direct them to a different object. No statement clearer than the Chancellor of the Exchequer's could possibly have been made. Look at the contrast, my Lords. Referring to Disendowment, he said&#x2014;
<quote>"If it refers to endowments given to the present Church as a separate spiritual organisation, and not as a national institution, and given without any legislative Act, then I admit that such a measure of disendowment would be unfair and unjust to the Anglican Church in wales."</quote>
He went very far. He said that if the historical basis of the proposals he was going to make was other than he thought it was, those proposals would be unjust and unfair. He went on to say in anti-thesis&#x2014;
<quote>"But if it refers to charges imposed by law upon the land of Wales to be administered by the officials of a State religion, not merely for their own maintenance, but for purely secular purposes, such as the maintenance of the poor, the healing of the sick, and the education of the community, then the legislative power that imposed the charge, created the trust, chose the trustees, and declared the objects of the trust has a right either to restore its original purposes or to vary them, to change, if it will, the trustees, and even, if it so think fit, to abolish the charge altogether."</quote>
You could not have a stronger antithesis or a clearer statement of an historical foundation for a policy. The Home Secretary followed suit, because he said that&#x2014;
<quote>"Tithes in Wales were not the offspring of piety; they were the creation of law."</quote>
What my noble friend did was to ask the noble Marquess who leads the House to tell us what was the legislative Act referred to by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and what was the law referred to by the Home Secretary. And what is the noble Marquess's reply? His reply is to tell us that tithes were enforced by Civil authority after the Norman Conquest. But nobody doubted that. They are so enforced now. That was not what the Chancellor of the Exchequer or the Home Secretary said. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that they were imposed by a legislative Act, and the Home Secretary said they were created by law. My noble friend asked the Leader of the House to give us the reference to that law, and he has not done so. Why he has not done so I hope presently to show your Lordships.<lb/>
Then the second point emphasised by the Chancellor of the Exchequer was that
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0422"/>
<col>793</col>
tithes, whatever their origin, had been instituted not merely for the maintenance of the officials of a State religion but for purely secular purposes, and he went on to define those secular purposes as the maintenance of the poor, the healing of the sick, and the education of the community. And the Chancellor of the Exchequer said quite distinctly that a legislative authority bad defined these secular purposes as part of the purposes of tithe. My noble friend asked the Leader of the House to give him the reference to the law under which tithe was to be used for these purely secular purposes as well as for the maintenance of ministers of religion. What is the noble Marquess's reply? Instead of giving us a reference to any Act of Parliament or to any legislative Act whatever, he tells us that the tithes endowed persons who had been accustomed to use the money at their disposal for charitable works&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01597"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I think I gave the reference to the two Acts of 1535 and 1537 which made the payment of tithe a legal obligation, in the first case in England and in the second case in Wales.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01598"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: Tithe had been a legal obligation long before those Acts. Those Acts did not create tithe or define the purposes for which tithe was to be used&#x2014;the statement made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I think the noble Marquess will find that what I say is quite true&#x2014;namely, that those Acts neither created tithe nor defined the purposes for which tithe was to be used. Then the noble Marquess stated that it was a matter of opinion whether the payment of tithe was not distinctly charged with poor relief. That is a very important statement, and we have a right to ask for the authority on which that statement is based. The use of this brief discussion, I submit, will be this, that it will enable the supporters of these measures when the proper time comes to give us a real historical foundation for the statements which they make, because, as I will show your Lordships briefly, that historical foundation has not yet been found.<lb/>
The last statement to which my noble friend behind me referred was the statement of the Home Secretary that the income of the Church in Wales sprang partly from Parliamentary grants. I ask, Would not any one reading those words
<col>794</col>
think that "Parliamentary grant" meant a vote in the Appropriation Act of the taxpayers' money for the use of the Church in Wales? But from what the noble Marquess the Leader of the House tells us it appears that the right hon. gentleman had in his mind Queen Anne's Bounty, the origin of which, as every member of your Lordships' House and every one outside this House knows, had nothing whatever to do with the taxpayers' money or with grants from Parliament. I wish to summarise the matter thus. Two members of the Cabinet have made definite statements giving an historical basis for the proposals they are going to make. My noble friend behind me has asked the Leader of the House for the chapter and verse of those Acts of Parliament or Parliamentary grants, and the noble Marquess is quite unable to give us any authority whatever for the statements made by his two colleagues. I do not wonder at his inability to do so. There is no such authority.<lb/>
This question has been investigated by great authorities. I will only quote two of them. The first authority I will quote is Professor Freeman, the great historian, not, so far as I know, a particularly strong or convinced Churchman, who approached this question exclusively from the point of view of historical accuracy. What Professor Freeman said was this&#x2014;
<quote>"We must put out of sight the popular notion that at some time or other the State determined to make a general national endowment of religion&#x2026;The process began in the earliest times and it has gone on ever since, and nothing was done systematically at any time. This King or that Earl founded and endowed this or that church in which he felt a special interest."</quote>
And again&#x2014;
<quote>"There was no moment when the State took the Church property from one religious body and gave it to another."</quote>
Lastly, Professor Freeman says&#x2014;
<quote>"Church property is not national property except in the same sense in which all property is national property."</quote>
That was Professor Freeman's view, and whether it is right or wrong I think every one will admit that on such a subject he was a perfectly unbiassed authority.<lb/>
The second authority I am going to quote, and I make no apology for doing so, is the authority of my father. I admit that on such a subject as the relations of
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0423"/>
<col>795</col>
Church and State the noble Marquess opposite may not consider him equally unbiassed with Professor Freeman. But he was a great lawyer; he had all the training which a legal mind brings with it; and no man was ever more careful in his investigations or less prone to exaggeration in the statements to which he committed himself. The quotation which I am now going to give was written nearly thirty years ago. My father's views have stood the test of nearly thirty years historical examination and nobody has yet refuted them, and until they are refuted I think I am entitled to quote them and to say that his judgment on history holds the field. If the noble Marquess, in the middle of his great labours, could find time to look at the works of my father on this subject, which are not long, he would at any rate approach this question when it comes to the House of Lords with a complete knowledge of the case of his opponents. What my father wrote was this&#x2014;
<quote>"As to tithes, whatever else may be doubtful, this is quite certain, that they were never the property of or payable to the State before or after their appropriation&#x2026;and that they were never so appropriated by any general public Act of the State."</quote>
And again&#x2014;
<quote>"No law was ever made in England in which it was laid down that the poor were to have any share in tithes."</quote>
He went on absolutely to disprove, after having personally examined every record, charter, document, or chronicle bearing on this case&#x2014;and his disproof has never been refuted&#x2014;that tithes were imposed by any Act of the Legislature for purely secular purposes. Every single definite historical statement on which the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Home Secretary base the justice of the proposals they are going to make in respect of the endowments of the Church in Wales has been disproved in advance by Professor Freeman and by my father.<lb/>
In conclusion, I will adduce one illustration. After all, this question of the origin of tithes is not purely a matter of opinion or of historical investigation. Some of the original acts of donation are still in existence, and I will quote from one of them. This is the endowment by tithe of the parish church of Hay, in Brecknock-
<col>796</col>
shire, about the year 1120. Bernard Bishop of St. Davids went to consecrate the church on its erection, and his charter on the consecration of the church is still extant and is to be found in the archives of the Bodleian Library at Oxford. In this charter is recited the gift of tithe by William Revel, the then landowner of the parish. These are the words&#x2014;
<quote>"Also he gave to the said church all the tithe of all his land of Hay in all things and of all his tenants of the fee of Hay."</quote>
There is the act of an individual churchman from a sense of religious obligation, giving as a perpetual endowment to his parish church the tithe of all his land. There is no Act of the Legislature, there is no creation by the State, and there is not one single suggestion of any use of that tithe or any part of it for secular purposes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01599"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Perhaps I may be allowed to correct one point on which I think the noble Earl misapprehended what I said. In speaking of a Parliamentary grant I was not referring to any grant made from Queen Anne's Bounty, but to the sums of&#x00A3;100,000 apiece which were appropriated by Vote of the House of Commons to Queen Anne's Bounty for the purposes of the Church each year from 1809 to 1820 inclusive. Of those grants the Welsh Church, of course, received its share, and that was the sum to which my right hon. friend was alluding when he spoke of a Parliamentary grant. Then the noble Earl asked me for the references to the two Acts of Henry VIII. The first was 25 Henry VIII, Chap. 19, and the second 27 Henry VIII, Chap. 26.</membercontribution></p>

There is no blockade of the Dardanelles, and we know of no further firing than that which has been reported in the Press. In a communication to the Turkish Government we have expressed the hope, while recognising the right of Turkey to adopt measures of self-defence, that the Turkish Government will find it possible to open a passage through the straits to foreign commerce as soon as possible, on account of the great and obvious injury which is being caused to commercial and shipping interests by the temporary closure of the straits. We have reason to believe that the Turkish Government are fully alive to the importance of the question, but they are unable to give any assurance in existing circumstances. Information has been asked for as to what has occurred with regard to floating mines, and whether any measures have been taken to prevent them from being carried into the open sea. We are informed that no mines have been set free, and that no floating unattached mines have been used. One mine escaped, but was recaptured at Dedeagatch. The mines that have been laid in the straits are, we are informed on good authority, of such a character as to become innocuous if they break loose. As to the position in the&#x00C6;gean, the Consul at Samos has reported that two Italian war vessels bombarded Turkish barracks there and destroyed a <i>stationnaire</i>. The Turkish troops retired into the interior. The Tenedos-Lemnos and Chio-Syra-Tenedos cables are reported to have been cut.

<title>THE NATIONAL RESERVE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01620"><member>LORD SAYE AND SELE</member> rose to ask the Secretary of State for War how he proposed to deal with the National Reserve in the case of a national emergency. The noble Lord said: My Lords, I hope that the noble Viscount will tell us here, where he will be accurately reported, his intentions regarding the National Reserve in a time of national emergency. The National Reserve has been in existence now for about two years. The County Associations, for the most part, have done extremely good work in connection with it, and those County Associations which have held back have done so, I am quite sure, from a feeling that they were working in the dark. The Secretary of State for War has now plenty of information to go upon. He knows that he has, or can have, 150,000 men under forty years of age, containing a blend of Regular and Auxiliary forces&#x2014;somewhere about half and half.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01621">The National Reserve Regulations are excessively meagre at present, and can be boiled down into the few following words: "The County Associations may do exactly what they please with the National Reserve provided they do not expend more than a shilling per man per annum. That shilling may be expended on an annual parade; a certain number of rifles may be obtained on loan; and ammunition may be obtained on payment." I put it to your Lordships and to the noble Viscount that
<col>800</col>
a shilling per man per annum is not only inadequate, but is a ridiculous sum in connection with a National Reserve if that force is wanted at all. The Regulations mention an annual parade&#x2014;well, a shilling per man per annum will not provide that. They also mention shooting as useful&#x2014;the shilling will not provide that. Indeed, the shilling barely pays for efficient registration.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01622">The noble Viscount is reported to have said&#x2014;I do not pretend to vouch for the accuracy of the report&#x2014;last month at the Guildhall&#x2014;
<quote>"The Territorial Force is not in a position which need lead any one to despair. All its units are there; it is equipped for war; it is commanded admirably by trained officers; it has attained five-sixths of the numbers necessary to complete it."</quote>
I pause to ask why we should not despair if the establishment of the Territorial Force is only five-sixths of that which has been fixed as the necessary establishment. I conclude that the further words of the noble Viscount are the answer. For the noble Viscount went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"Behind it there is now the National Reserve, which at any time of national emergency we can mobilise in order to strengthen and stiffen the Territorial Force with veterans."</quote>
And then only yesterday the noble Viscount is reported as having stated, in addressing a Territorial demonstration at Barnstaple, that all military and naval organisation in this country depended on foreign policy. He added&#x2014;
<quote>"We did not need to make home defence our first concern. We were girt round by the sea, and so long as we had the Navy commanding that we could rely on the spirit of the citizens of the country."</quote>
The noble Viscount is also reported to have said, regarding the Territorial Force&#x2014;
<quote>"They had a percentage which made him feel very comfortable, particularly now that they had organised at the back a body of trained men who had completed their service to the State and were able to give a hand when there was a pinch."</quote>
I do not know whether a "pinch" and a "national emergency" are the same thing. The noble Viscount added&#x2014;
<quote>"The bulk of the Associations are well off in funds, and the organisation is working smoothly throughout the country."</quote>
I cannot understand how the County Associations can be well off and possess plenty of funds when they are only allowed a shilling a man per annum in regard to the National Reserve. That shilling, as I have
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0426"/>
<col>801</col>
said, will not provide either of the two things which are essential if the National Reserve is needed at all. Having been an adjutant of both Line and Militia I can confidently say that registering these men is absolutely useless unless you can keep in touch with them, and the shilling will not enable you to do that. That is the first essential. The second essential is that facilities should be given for shooting, and the shilling a man will not enable you to give those facilities. It will, as I have said, barely pay for efficient registration. I beg to ask the noble Viscount the Question which stands in my name.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01623"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend has taken a commendable interest in the National Reserve, but there is one thing which I observe he has not done. He has not studied the Regulations relating to the National Reserve. If he had done so he would have found, first of all, that the shilling per head given to the County Associations is intended purely for the secretarial work of registration and minor purposes of that kind. In the second place, he would have found that the National Reserve is not intended to be a body organised in military <i>cadres</i> and to be mobilised. He quoted from a speech of mine in which the reporter made me speak as if the National Reserve was a body which would be mobilised like other forces. I need not say that that is not so, and that I did not say so. The National Reserve is a register of men in this country who have had military training; it is a very comprehensive register, and comprises old and young&#x2014;that is to say, as young as they can be after having gone through their time with the Colours. The way in which it is proposed to use that register is this. In the first place, to classify it&#x2014;that the Associations do in a general way&#x2014;and then, in time of necessity, to call for volunteers from it. In addition to that, the younger men have an opportunity, if they wish, to do something more definite, to take a definite engagement. They have the opportunity either of joining the Territorial Reserve, and in that case, of course, they receive uniform and pay when they are out, or, if they prefer it, of joining the Special Reserve, for which special arrangements have been made for them. Beyond that there is a class of men to whom, not in time of peace but on mobilisation, other opportunities of taking engagement will be offered. But
<col>802</col>
the bulk, or at least a large proportion, of the National Reserve must always consist of men who are old enough to be able to do little more than contribute by their military spirit and encouragement to the interest of their fellow-citizens in military subjects.<lb/>
As regards parades, which my noble friend wishes to see they are most laudable things, but except upon rare occasions they ought to be local. If he would go to Austria or to Germany and look at the parades there of the men who correspond to the National Reserve here, he would see that every village and every place has its own arrangements under which these men come out, and a splendid thing it is in the way of example to their fellow-citizens. There are occasions on which, on another footing, bigger parades of the National Reserve may be held, but these are matters for voluntary arrangement. A great one is going to take place on June 8 in Hyde Park, at which the King has graciously signified his pleasure to be present to review the National Reserve; and there was a parade held recently at the Horse Guards, also made by private arrangement, and no doubt from time to time when convenient these parades will take place. But the average parade of the National Reserve ought to be a local matter, and does not require the machinery of which my noble friend has spoken.<lb/>
I should add that, while people are getting very much better informed about the true functions of the National Reserve than they were, and while we think we have made them quite clear in documents, we still find obscurity of thought on the matter in certain quarters. We have therefore appointed an officer of great experience whose whole time is now being devoted to going round and explaining to the Associations and those connected with the National Reserve what its true functions are, the nature of the classification, the opportunities that exist for members of the National Reserve who are willing to take a definite engagement, and generally clearing up points of obscurity; and I think that my noble friend, when be has come in contact with this officer and has seen more of the working of the registration system which we have inaugurated, will find that it is not so obscure as he seems to think.</membercontribution></p>

For, unless I mistook him, he seemed to think that the National Reserve itself, or the great bulk of that force, could not be looked upon as of any use in time of emergency, but were there simply as an encouragement to younger men to join the various forces which serve His Majesty.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01627"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: It is impossible yet to say what the numbers will be, but there is a substantial number of men who are too old to give more than moral assistance. I agree with the noble Marquess, however, that there is a very large body&#x2014;some say they amount to 50 per cent., but I should have thought not more than 30 per cent.&#x2014;who would be of immense war service.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01628"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: I am glad to have obtained that statement from the noble Viscount, because if his previous observation had gone out as he gave it, it would probably have had a damping effect upon the National Reserve. I know a good deal about the subsidiary forces of the Crown, and in my humble judgment a very large number of the men in the National Reserve&#x2014;I should have thought a majority of them&#x2014;would be of substantial use in time of emergency. They are trained men; they know how to fire; and if a moment of invasion came we should be very glad that we had these veterans to fall back upon. I only rose to prevent any misconception which might have arisen from the original words of the noble Viscount, and I am glad he has corrected them.</membercontribution></p>

They are little more than routine. The first deals with stoppages out of the pay of officers in India in penal cases. It is provided, at the wish of the Indian Government, that all such cases should be reported to the Indian Government, so that the authorities there may take action upon them. The next Amendment enables the stoppage out of the pay of a soldier, when a bastardy order has been made against him, to be increased in the case of a noncommissioned officer from 6<i>d</i>. to 7<i>d</i>., and in the case of a soldier below that rank from 3<i>d</i>. to 4<i>d.,</i> and there is also an Amendment making this provision apply to existing bastardy orders. There is also an Amendment extending the provisions of the Geneva Convention to voluntary aid
<col>808</col>
societies in this country as well as abroad. Then there is an Amendment which is required for the purpose of the South African Government in accordance with their new Defence Act. It is a purely technical matter, simply effecting an alteration in the Army Act so as to make it work I in South Africa. There is also a provision I increasing the schedule of allowances for billeting in inns, in places where there is a legal liability, making a slight addition for the future to what the Army has to pay.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01699">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01700"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I ask your Lordships to give this Bill a Second Reading to-day. I am fortified and encouraged in this request by the fact that a very influential deputation laid the points of this Bill before the Home Office and were given to understand that, for reasons with which I need not trouble your Lordships, the House of Commons was otherwise engaged, and it was suggested to the promoters of the Bill that the measure should be introduced in your Lordships' House. The object of this Bill is to ameliorate as far as possible the conditions of life of those who earn their bread in circumstances to which existing legislation does not effectively apply. Those conditions are already contemplated by certain Acts, but for reasons
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0432"/>
<col>813</col>
which I shall state to your Lordships those Acts do not effectively apply. The persons whom it is proposed to benefit by this Bill are those who carry on their employment in underground workshops workrooms or workplaces. At present there is no statutory definition of a "workplace," but in Committee I shall move to insert one.<lb/>
The well-dressed portion of society walk about the London streets, especially in the West-End and look at the well-appointed shops where they buy their clothes and other things but a great many of those persons are not in the least aware that underneath the shops there is a vast mass of employment going on under conditions of light and ventilation which are not consistent with health. Owing to the high rents and the high value of land in the more crowded portions of London and of other towns there has been a temptation to let off the upper parts of shops as flats for dwelling purposes and to put workpeople into the basements. I am not going this afternoon to make a frontal attack on employers of labour, because those who are most anxious to see this Bill pass admit that there has been during the last ten or fifteen years a very large increase in the benefits which employers have given to their workpeople in underground basements. Many employers have done their best to alleviate the conditions, and a great many employers are in a sense unfairly treated in the matter, because they have taken premises which have already been passed as suitable for warehouses and that sort of thing in the full belief that they would be able to use the basements as workrooms later on. The same amount of cubic space per workman is contemplated in a basement by existing Acts as in an upper room yet it is obviously desirable that there should be fewer people employed underground than upstairs, where there is full access to air and light. Therefore the employer who does submit to some sacrifice in order that his workpeople may have a suitable workroom upstairs with full access to air and light is in no better position than the employer who compels his workpeople to work in the basement.<lb/>
What I am putting before your Lordships this afternoon is not only what I have been told. I have taken a certain amount of trouble, dressed in the costume of a sanitary
<col>814</col>
inspector, to go round and see several of these places on my own account. I am informed that I have been shown only those which present the most favourable conditions, and that there are many places, into which I should probably not have been allowed to penetrate, where worse conditions prevail. But having seen underground workrooms where the conditions have been represented to me as being the most favourable, I am absolutely convinced from ocular demonstration that some strengthening of the law is necessary. This Bill has nothing to do with wages, and does not contemplate the sweated industries of the country; but I should like to tell your Lordships that I know of an authentic case of a coat made in the East-End of London for which the workman employed on it only received 8<i>s</i>., but which was afterwards sold, perhaps to a member of your Lordships' House for&#x00A3;8 8<i>s</i>.<lb/>
It is not, of course, suggested that all work underground is necessarily injurious. There are degrees of injury. Where work is carried on by men and women who are constantly moving about the circulation is kept going, and the work is not so injurious to the general <i>morale</i> and health of the workers as in the case of sedentary occupations. It is particularly at sedentary occupations that this legislation is aimed in this respect certain trades are scheduled at the end of this Bill. It is a schedule upon which I do not insist, and which is inserted more in the nature of examples of the trades particularly affected than anything else; and it will be seen that they are trades which involve sedentary occupation and also a strain upon the eyes. Not only that but the whole <i>morale</i> of a person working all day long in artificial light and without proper ventilation must be very seriously affected. Sedentary work all day long affects, among other things the lungs, and it cannot be denied that working underground where there is no really fresh air is bound to produce in women an an&#x00E6;mic condition which is particularly bad from the eugenic point of view for the future of the race. I need not labour this point, because I am sure your Lordships all agree that on account of the absence of light and fresh air and on account of the dampness and the difficulty of excluding what is called ground air in these places. the general health of those who work in basements is bound sooner or later to suffer.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0433"/>
<col>815</col>
It is quite true that if you go into the underground places below some of our large stores in the West-End of London you will see a life going on which has apparently very little the matter with it, and you will find people there who are cheerful and contented and who have worked there for a considerable time. But the answer to that is that those whom you find there and who have worked there for a considerable time represent in reality the survival of the fittest. The general rule with regard to occupation of this kind is that it does not last very long, and nobody will undertake it unless he or she is obliged to do so. This is particularly noticeable with regard to the domestic servant class, who are, perhaps, more able to pick and choose the houses in which they will work than others of the working classes. There is a growing tendency among the domestic servant class not to take situations in houses where a great deal of the work has to be carried on in basements. In this connection it is interesting to notice that since regulations with regard to domestic servants sleeping in basements have been stringent in the last few years, the Legislature is in this rather peculiar position. It contemplates the undesirability of a domestic servant sleeping in a basement unless certain conditions are complied with, yet at the same time it apparently has no objection to a large number of workpeople working all day long in a place the nature of which has already been condemned for the purposes of sleeping. I make no specific charge in this respect, for it is only hearsay evidence; but I am told that even Government offices are not entirely exempt from some of the bad conditions contemplated by this Bill.<lb/>
The existing legislation with regard to underground workshops and workplaces is not in a satisfactory state. In the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. is set out Section 91 of the Public Health Act, 1875, and with your Lordships' permission I will read the section. It runs&#x2014;
<quote>"Any factory, workshop, or workplace which is not a factory subject to the provisions of the Factory and Workshop Act relating to cleanliness, ventilation, and over-crowding, and&#x2026;is not ventilated in such a manner as to render harmless as far as practicable any gases, vapours, dust, or other impurities generated in the course of the work carried on therein that are a nuisance or injurious or dangerous to health&#x2026;shall he nuisances liable to be dealt with summarily under this Act."</quote>
<col>816</col>
This section makes it easy to deal with nuisances arising from special circumstances such as the use of an unventilated gas-stove, but it is not so satisfactory when dealing with insufficient means of Ventilation due to structural conditions. The crux of this matter lies in the fact that, even if all the intentions of the Factory Acts and the Public Health Acts could be mobilised with regard to these places, the structural conditions which prevail are not of a character which would allow proper lighting and Ventilation to be carried out.<lb/>
There is another matter with regard to existing legislation which I think ought to be cleared up in this Bill. It is not in the Bill at the present moment, but I am going to ask your Lordships' permission at the Committee stage to introduce into the Bill a definition of a "workplace," the absence of which definition at the present moment causes a considerable amount of confusion and renders the Legislature unable to deal with places of this kind. I shall move to add to the Bill this definition&#x2014;
<quote>"A 'workplace' is any place, not being a factory or a workshop, where work is done permanently and where people assemble together to do work permanently of some kind or other."</quote>
There is no doubt whatever that the whole system of sedentary occupations in basements, where there is no ventilation possible except the air that comes immediately from the surface of the street, which is very often charged with noxious matter, and where on most days in the year it is impossible to work except by electric light, or, what is still worse for the eyes, a light which is half natural and half artificial, is very undesirable in the public interest and in the interest of the health of the nation. It is therefore in spite of the fact that a great many employers have shown a most laudable desire to improve the condition of their workers in underground workplaces that this Bill is introduced, and I hope that it will mark a tendency to fortify legislation in this matter and make it easier for those persons who are charged with the duty of seeing to the public health to carry out their duties.<lb/>
I will not go through the Bill at any length now. Clause 1 makes a general
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0434"/>
<col>817</col>
provision with regard to existing places and Clause 2 aims at a still further strengthening of these provisions in a few years' time. I know that it is exceedingly difficult to propose legislation which shall have the effect of doing away altogether with work in underground work places. In the City of London, for instance, owing to the way in which all available space is built over, it would be exceedingly difficult and would create great hardship and a great deal of opposition; but there is much that can be done by giving power to district councils to pass places to be used for the purpose of underground workshops, and also by&#x2014;as is proposed in Clause 7 of the Bill&#x2014;enabling the Secretary of State by a special Order, which I imagine he would be able to alter from time to time, to draw up a general set of provisions which should be applicable by the district council in all districts.<lb/>
The second paragraph of Clause 6 reads&#x2014;
<quote>"As respects every underground factory, workshop, or workplace, the provisions of this Act shall be enforced by the district council of the district in which the premises may be situated, and not by an inspector under the principal Acts, and for the purposes of this Act the medical officer of health and the inspector of nuisances of the district council shall have and may exercise all the powers of entry, inspection, taking legal proceedings, and otherwise of an inspector under the principal Acts."</quote>
It is proposed at a later stage to omit the words "and not by a sanitary inspector under the principal Acts." This legislation is in its essence really tentative in this regard, and it will be quite possible in the future, even in places where land is already very much built over, to make underground places more habitable by insisting on what is called the open area, or, in other places where the open area has, as is sometimes the case, been deliberately built over, by requiring the front portion of the shop in which the goods are exhibited to be raised in such a manner that there shall be a window above the street level which shall admit a certain amount of light and air into the underground workplace. I feel sure that your Lordships will see the desirability of dealing with the condition of these people by means of legislation, and I have great confidence in asking you to give this Bill a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>

<col>818</col>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01702"><sup>*</sup><member>THE PAYMASTER-GENERAL (LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord has given a lucid exposition of the objects which his Bill contemplates, and has pointed out its main provisions. I may say at once that the Government sympathise with the objects that the noble Lord has in view. He referred to a deputation which was received by my hon, friend the Under-Secretary for the Home Department, and to the advice which my hon. friend gave to the members of that deputation to promote a Bill in this House with the view of having the subject discussed and inviting criticism and consideration of it. The noble Lord told your Lordships that many of the objects he has in view are already covered, though only, perhaps, partially covered, by existing legislation. The first nine clauses of the Factory and Workshop Act of 1901 deal with the subjects of ventilation and sanitation, and they are applicable to underground workshops just as much as to any other. But I admit that in the case of underground workshops such as those to which the noble Lord refers in this Bill there is a necessity for rather more stringent regulations than are possible under existing legislation; and it is, of course, quite a different thing to oblige an employer to obtain a certificate of the suitability of his premises for the work from merely making him amenable to the general provisions of factory legislation.<lb/>
The Government agree that the noble Lord has made out a case, and that with regard to underground workshops more stringent provisions are necessary with regard to light, ventilation, sanitation, and so forth. The question arises, What should those provisions be? The Bill which the noble Lord has introduced contemplates two main provisions. One is that all existing underground workshops which come within the scheduled trades must have a local authority's certificate. Presumably the certificate is to be based on regulations to be issued by the Secretary of State, but that is not clear. That is the first provision. But the Bill goes further and lays down, as far as I understand, that no new underground workshop shall be started. The drafting of the Bill is not very clear. It either prohibits them altogether in future, OR prohibits them unless they comply&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01703"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member><membercontribution>: Unless they comply with subsection (2) of Clause 2 of this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0435"/>
<col>819</col>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01704"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: The prohibition is limited to the case of their not complying with subsection (2) of Clause 2. The position of the Government on these two points is this. The Government agree to the first proposition&#x2014;namely, that underground premises should only be carried on if they have a certificate from the local authority&#x2014;but with regard to the prohibition, although it is a limited prohibition, the Government think that it would be going rather too far. The noble Lord alluded to the fact that the great and growing pressure on space in big towns was largely responsible for the state of things which we now deplore That is no doubt true. But if it is responsible for the present state of affairs it also, I think, indicates that we should not take any unnecessary step to further limit the accommodation which is now so limited in the case of large towns. To prohibit all underground workshops subject to this Very stringent provision seems to me to condemn premises which are as yet unbuilt. It may be perfectly true that few existing premises can be considered satisfactory. There may be structural difficulties which render proper ventilation almost impossible. But the difficulties of light and ventilation have as a matter of fact, I believe, been overcome in some of the most modern buildings, and there is no reason to suppose that there is any structural impossibility to give proper light and ventilation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01705"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member><membercontribution>: Not if there is the open area.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01706"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: The Government, at any rate are not prepared to go so far as complete prohibition. And we do not think it is necessary, because if underground workshops are to be subject to regulations framed by the Secretary of State and applied by the local authority, those regulations of themselves, we think, should be sufficient to obtain the objects which the noble Lord has in view. We think it would be undesirable to make this prohibition, limited though it is, in view of the fact that the results should be obtainable by the regulations which the Bill contemplates. On general lines that is the position of the Government with regard to the measure.<lb/>
I do not propose to take the House at this stage into any details, but I should like to be allowed, in passing, to refer to
<col>820</col>
the Schedule. It is not very easy to see upon what principle the selection has been made. The noble Lord referred to sedentary occupation and strain on the sight-as being the objects which guided him mainly in selecting these particular trades, but I think they want looking into very carefully. We should not like to commit ourselves at this stage to agreeing to this particular Schedule; and I think the noble Lord stated that he put the list forward rather as examples than as a complete or exhaustive list of the trades to which he would like the Bill to apply. I do not know, for instance, what the hair trade is. I understand, however, that the noble Lord is prepared to accept suggestions from the Government on the subject of the Schedule. Then the noble Lord has included in the Schedule the preparation of food for sale in restaurants and coffee houses, and also typewriting. I would point out to him in regard to both of those trades that there is likely to be considerable controversy and. farther, that neither of them is at present included under the Factory Acts and they do not come within the purview of the Home Office. These are matters which will have to be discussed in Committee. I say, in conclusion, that the Government will be prepared to render the noble Lord any assistance they can with a view to improving this Bill, and if he will accept their assistance and submit to certain Amendments in Committee the Government hope to be able to give the Bill their support through its remaining stages.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01707"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords. I think your Lordships always view with a certain amount of caution any advance in the direction of restrictive legislation upon trade. That is a proper frame of mind in which to approach any legislation of this kind. At the same time it must be admitted that Parliament is already committed to a large extent on the subject of underground premises. Underground premises are already not permitted to be used for certain purposes, sleeping and so forth and for bakehouses, I think, under a recent Factory Act. Parliament having committed itself in that direction, we may consider that the door is open to a further advance. I think, speaking for myself alone, that Parliament was well advised in making this distinction, because it is clear that the conditions of underground premises in regard to light and air
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0436"/>
<col>821</col>
do render them much less fit for human habitation and work than ordinary premises. Having therefore, as it were, established the principle, the only question for us is whether my noble friend is wise in trying to extend the principle, and I think he has made his case out so far as the main outline of this Bill is concerned.<lb/>
The noble Lord who spoke on behalf of His Majesty's Government seemed to think that no distinction ought to be drawn between existing premises used for this purpose and similar premises to be hereafter erected. I cannot quite agree with him there. After all, so far as existing premises are concerned, the persons who are using them have a certain position in which they can ask Parliament for gentle treatment. They have already embarked their capital and enterprise in the business, and have premises of this kind in which to carry it on. They did not know that restrictive legislation was going to be imposed, and they naturally would be reluctant to be put to any great expense in consequence. That is the case with regard to existing workplaces under the conditions contemplated by the Bill, but it is not the case with future ones. It seems to me that we might be well advised in imposing greater restrictions on buildings hereafter to be erected than on existing buildings. I do not mean to say that it is right that any existing underground workshop should be permitted whatever its conditions. I think my noble friend is probably right that it should be made necessary that a certificate should be obtained from the proper authority that the premises are in a fit condition for such work, but I cannot go the full length of the doctrine of the noble Lord who spoke on behalf of His Majesty's Government that no distinction us to be made between their case and the case of workplaces hereafter to be established. Therefore I rather welcome the distinction between the two which is drawn in the Bill.<lb/>
Whether my noble friend has been judicious in the exact limitation which he has made in the two cases I do not go into at the moment; but broadly speaking, it appears to me to be a good distinction. As to underground premises hereafter to be used as workplaces, what you in fact will provide is that no such premises will be erected except under the well-known conditions imposed by the local or central authority, which it is necessary to comply
<col>822</col>
with in order to obtain the certificate. People will be subject to no hardship whatever. They will know in the future what the conditions are; they will comply with them, and no difficulty will arise. But when you are dealing with existing buildings, of course the difficulties are much greater. Therefore I think the distinction is of value. To some extent you must put up with existing buildings even if they are not ideal, but you need not put up with similar buildings in the future. In their case prevention is better than cure. It is far better to see that the buildings are put up properly than to go with an inspector hereafter and insist upon structural alterations which may be very difficult to carry out. Therefore I hope that the Government will not absolutely make up their mind that there should be no distinction between the two cases, although I do not wish at this moment to prescribe in any way what the conditions should be in either category. I think the Government are well advised in subjecting this; Bill to very careful scrutiny. It is a Bill which could only be passed after proper consideration by the Government Department concerned with their expert knowledge. I cannot help hoping that after that process has been gone through, my noble friend will be able to congratulate himself upon having added to the Statute Book a useful piece of legislation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01708"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: I should like to explain one point. I am advised that as the Bill now stands all future underground workshops would be prohibited. That is the point I tried to make. We do not think we ought to go as far as that. We think, as the noble Marquess said, that future premises should be so constructed as to comply with the regulations made, but that there should not be complete prohibition.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01731"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF WAKEFIELD</member> rose to call attention to the failure of the West Riding County Council to carry out its undertaking to build chapels (to be used by all denominations) in connection with two lunatic asylums in their district, which in one case at least was admitted by the chairman of the West Riding Asylums Committee to be "a breach of faith"; and to ask His Majesty's Government whether any steps are proposed to be taken to compel the council to fulfil its obligation; and to move for Papers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01732">The right rev. Prelate said: My Lords, the Question which I have put on the Notice Paper for this afternoon need not, I think, detain your Lordships at any great length of time, but it raises some issues of very wide and grave importance, first of all with regard to the fidelity of public bodies in keeping their pledged obligations, and, secondly, the traditions of treatment regarding the mentally afflicted in pauper asylums, and incidentally, also, it raises the question of decent provision for the public presentation of religion in the way of public worship. I will put the facts as shortly as I can before your Lordships and then give my reasons for bringing this matter before the House. There are two large pauper asylums in the West Riding County Council district of Yorkshire which have no chapels attached to them, no special provision in the way of any building for the conduct of public worship. In an answer given in the House of Commons last week the Home Secretary said&#x2014;
<quote>"Out of the ninety-four lunatic asylums in England and Wales all except seven have chapels. The Commissioners in Lunacy have always considered a chapel to be an essential part of every properly-equipped asylum. Of the seven asylums not provided with chapels two are at present incomplete and two are old and small asylums. The remaining three are the Menston, Storthes Hall, and Scalebor Park Asylums, all in the West Riding of Yorkshire. The erection of these asylums was sanctioned on the understanding that chapels would be provided."</quote>
I think there is a slight mistake in that answer, as Scalebor Park Asylum is not a pauper asylum.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01733">The first of the two asylums to which I am asking your Lordships' attention is the Menston Asylum, a large asylum built in 1888 and containing about 1,700 or more pauper patients, with a large staff of
<col>826</col>
attendants&#x2014;close upon 2,000 souls altogether. When the plans for Menston Asylum were submitted to the Home Secretary a chapel was shown, and it was on the understanding that such a chapel would be built that the plans were sanctioned. This is now, as your Lordships will observe, many years since, but there is no chapel there to-day. The Lunacy Commissioners have frequently in their reports expostulated with the Visiting Committee of the West Riding County Council, but all their efforts have been met with a denial; and I understand, though I have no absolute proof, that a definite refusal has been given by the West Riding County Council to carry out any part of that obligation. The chairman of the West Riding County Council was one of the witnesses examined before the Commission on the Feeble-Minded, and in his examination he admitted that in the case of Menston Asylum this was a breach of faith. Therefore the case presents features which I feel sure your Lordships will not consider to be those which ought to be passed over in silence in regard to any public body.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01734">The second case&#x2014;that of the Storthes Hall Asylum&#x2014;is a still stronger case. This is a new asylum, also a large pauper asylum, built in 1904, and it is going to be a larger asylum even than Menston, as it is ultimately contemplated, I believe, to have something like 2,250 patients there. At present they have 1,634, with 210 attendants-a total of 1,844 persons in these large buildings. In the case of Storthes Hall, when the plans were presented in 1900 the Lunacy Commission insisted upon a chapel being shown, as is the invariable custom. The County Council demurred to this, but were told distinctly that as there had been a breach of faith in regard to the Menston Asylum the Lunacy Commission could not undertake to recommend the plans to the Home Office unless they received a definite undertaking that such a chapel would be built. That definite undertaking was given by an explicit resolution of the West Riding County Council on January 11, 1900. The plans were therefore sanctioned, not on the implied but on the express condition that a chapel would certainly be built; and not only was that resolution passed, but in 1904 plans were sanctioned for a chapel. These were ultimately modified and reduced in cost by about&#x00A3;3,000, and a contract was actually sanctioned by the
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0439"/>
<col>827</col>
Home Office for the building. Yet from that day to this nothing has been done to provide this chapel for the Storthes Hall Asylum. The ground was actually staked out before the greater part of the main buildings, and it was always understood that it was the intention of the Council to keep its word.<lb/>
The attention of the County Council has been frequently drawn to the matter, as in the former case, by the Lunacy Commission, but their representations have been just as steadily ignored. In spite of these remonstrances and the fact that it is twelve years since the plans were first submitted, there is no sign of a chapel at Storthes Hall Asylum. And not only have the County Council failed to provide this chapel, but in January of this year the matter was brought forward by one of the councillors, who moved to instruct the Asylums Committee to proceed forthwith to build a chapel in accordance with their pledged word and in accordance with the condition on which the plans had been sanctioned. This motion was practically refused by the majority of the County Council and was closured and defeated. Those are the facts, my Lords, which I believe no one will venture to question. I have not exaggerated them, but have simply stated them as a plain and not a very creditable tale. I am not lawyer enough to know whether under the Lunacy Act of 1890, which I believe is the authority for the administration of asylums, it is an absolute legal obligation to build a chapel as a necessary part of a large asylum, but the practice has been universal from the beginning, with the few exceptions named by the Home Secretary.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01735">Your Lordships will notice that of the seven exceptions given by the Home Secretary in his answer in the House of Commons which I have quoted, two are incomplete asylums and two are old and small asylums. All the remaining three, including the one private asylum I have mentioned, are in the district of the West Riding County Council. So this looks as if it were the decided and definite policy of the West Riding County Council not to provide proper and decent accommodation by way of a separate building for public worship in connection with their pauper asylums. And here, my Lords, I might remind you that it has never been the custom to
<col>828</col>
consecrate these chapels, nor are they in any sense Church of England buildings. They are open to all denominations, and as a matter of fact are so used. Therefore I am not here to-day to plead for any particular favour to my own denomination. I am here, so to speak, in the general interest of religion and of reverent worship, to ask that steps may be taken, if possible, to make proper provision for the poor unfortunate people in these pauper asylums who are labouring under mental incapacity. The practice apparently has, as I say, been almost universal. Not only have the West Riding County Council ignored this general practice, but they have so far failed to carry out their own undertaking&#x2014;and this is a very serious aspect of the matter-an undertaking, remember, by which they actually obtained the consent of the Home Secretary to their plans for this second asylum. They knew the plans would not be sanctioned unless such an undertaking were given. Therefore they passed a resolution promising to do their duty, but, having got their plans, they allow twelve years to pass without taking any step whatever, and now apparently intend, so far as I can gather, to evade these responsibilities altogether. It is only right to say that I have no absolute evidence that a definite refusal has been given, as was apparently given in the case of Menston, but it is, so to speak, an open secret that they have no intention of proceeding with the chapel at Storthes Hall.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01736">What has made this question immediately urgent is the fact that the West Riding County Council is at this moment promoting a Bill for a Joint Asylums Board by which the administration of these large asylums should be shared by the county boroughs and the expenses apportioned, I believe, in accordance with the number of pauper lunatics sent from each district. I am told that there is reason to think that if this Bill passes its Third Reading&#x2014;and it will shortly, I believe, be reported to this House for Third Reading&#x2014;they will finally wash their hands of all responsibility with regard to these chapels; and therefore it might even be a question for your Lordships' House to decide whether the Bill should be read a third time unless some satisfactory and definite assurance is given that the West Riding authority will carry out its undertaking. On this ground alone&#x2014;on the ground of what I might call the purity of public bodies&#x2014;I hope the House
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0440"/>
<col>829</col>
will think that I am justified in calling attention to the Failure of the West Riding County Council to keep, so to speak, its Parliamentary faith. In the public interest and, I think, on the broadest ground it is not right that such action should be passed over without full and satisfactory explanation, and I am hoping that His Majesty's Government may be able to give us some explanation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01737">But it may be urged, in reply, that the provision made for public worship and for the religious care of the inmates is adequate and satisfactory in these two asylums. I believe that is the attitude taken up by the Committee of the West Riding County Council. But unfortunately, as I shall show directly, the overwhelming experience of all experts in the treatment of the insane is exactly contrary. Services are, as a matter of fact, held in these asylums every Sunday, some of them Church of England services, some of them services conducted by Nonconformist bodies, but these services are held, in the case of the Storthes Hall Asylum, in a recreation room. A movable desk is put out into this large recreation room and placed just in front of the stage, upon which concerts and plays and variety entertainments have been frequently held immediately beforehand during the week. The same room is used for dancing, which, as your Lordships are aware, is a very pleasant and necessary part of the cure of the insane by way of brightening their lives and giving them some change. The whole surroundings, therefore, of this room are quite alien to the calm and dignified and solemn associations which ought to cling to public worship. I might urge these points upon your Lordships on the highest ground of all&#x2014;namely, the reverence and respect due to the corporate presentation of religion in public worship.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01738">These gentlemen who guide the policy of the Asylums Committee presumably have their own place of worship. They do not use theatres and music-halls and chance rooms to meet in for their regular worship on a Sunday, nor would they consider such buildings as these to be a "convenient place" even within the terms of the Act. For I believe the Act says that Divine Service must be held either in a chapel or in some other convenient place, and it is rather difficult to understand how
<col>830</col>
they, who value a reverent and decent public worship in churches or chapels of their own, after assembling these large numbers of patients in a place where they have no opportunity of attending either a consecrated or unconsecrated place of worship, should deprive them, I will not say of all the means of religion&#x2014;for individual religion is, after all, not so fully dependent upon its surroundings&#x2014;but should deprive them of those solemn exercises and hallowed associations by which religion is very powerfully supported in all of us; and if that is so in the case of persons in full control of their mental faculties, how much more is such a boon as this due to those who for a time at least are suffering from a weak mental condition. As Bishop who is responsible for the parish in which the great Storthes Hall Asylum is situated, I am bound to confess that I consider the arrangements for public worship in the recreation room of that asylum lamentably deficient.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01739">I pass on for a moment to another aspect of the case which I think will meet with your Lordships' appreciation. Quite apart from the interests of religion, it is, I think, universally admitted that reverent public worship is of quite marked importance and value in the curative treatment of the insane, to say nothing of their consolation and comfort. There is no doubt that the effect of the ministrations of religion, decently conducted in a dignified way, has a great deal to do with, and is an important factor in contributing to, the cure of these unfortunate people. The opinion of the Lunacy Commission is well known on this point. I could quote if there were time, but I shall not weary your Lordships with them, extracts from the visiting reports of the Lunacy Commission in which again and again they express the opinion that the absence of a separate place of worship deprives a large pauper lunatic asylum of what is almost essential to its complete equipment, and every medical superintendent to whom I have spoken or written assures me that there can be only one opinion on the subject.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01740">With your Lordships' permission I would like to quote the opinion of two gentlemen whose names will at once carry conviction. The first is Sir James Crichton Browne, who, I suppose, is one of our foremost authorities upon the whole subject. He
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0441"/>
<col>831</col>
writes to me from Crindau, Dumfries, under date April 19 last, as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"MY DEAR LORD BISHOP,&#x2014;I have just received your letter of the 16th instant, and have no hesitation in saying, in reply, that a suitable and separate place of worship is front the medical point of view an invaluable adjunct to an asylum for the insane. A building exclusively set apart for religious purposes keeps alive in the patients, in a way that no room or ball occasionally reserved for them but commonly appropriated to secular uses can do, a sense of sanctity and solemnity that is wholesome and contributory to the restoration of mental equilibrium. While Medical Director of the West Riding Asylum I regarded the beautiful chapel there, built from plans kindly gifted by the late Sir Gilbert Scott, as part of my pharmacop&#x0153;ia, and found that attendance at the services held in it was soothing, consolatory, and a premium on self-control alike in Church people and Dissenters. An asylum chapel should, in my opinion, be placed in the grounds at a little distance front the main building, so that the homely associations of church-going may be maintained, and should be not only decent but beautiful so that pleasing and harmonious impressions may be borne in upon the mind. Among the means employed in that moral treatment of the insane which has now in large measure superseded mere drugging I know of none more potent and salutary than those that appeal soberly and chastely to man's spiritual nature. Many recovered lunatics have told me that the dawn of returning reason came to them when kneeling in the asylum chapel. The directors of the great asylum here, the Crichton Royal Institution&#x2014;an institution for the insane of the upper and middle as well as for the poorer class&#x2014;acting under medical advice, built a number of years ago an asylum chapel of an exquisite architectural design which cost &#x00A3;30,000. They have never regretted the expenditure."</quote>
I will also read to your Lordships a letter from Sir Thomas Clouston, the well-known Edinburgh physician for the mentally afflicted. He writes, under date April 18 last&#x2014;
<quote>"I have the strongest views as to the advantages of a place of worship for the patients in mental hospitals from a medical point of view. Those patients are there not of their own free will; therefore there is a strong moral obligation resting on the committees of such hospitals to do everything that will be likely to cure them and make their lives happy. Such hospitals would be distinctly wanting in one means of cure and successful treatment were places of worship not available in them. A separate church is far better for the purpose than a room inside a hospital. 'Going to church' is to many patients a soothing thing to their mental state. Sacred music is well known to be helpful for the cure of some forms of mental disease, and the full effect of this is best obtained in church. The association of patients in church helps to revive dormant social instincts which is a common and painful symptom of their mental malady. I can speak on this subject as the result of forty-eight years' experience in the treatment of the insane in two mental hospitals in England and Scotland, in both
<col>832</col>
of which I got my committee to erect churches in the grounds, where before the religious services had been conducted in special rooms within the building. The results were marked and good."</quote>
I will not trouble your Lordships with them, but I have two or three more letters of a similar kind. The almost universal opinion of those who have to deal with the insane is that a separate chapel is almost a necessary part of the equipment of every asylum.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01741">I am not actuated in this matter by any hostility to the West Riding County Council, still less to the Asylums Committee of that body, and I gladly pay my tribute to the zeal, the energy, the business capacity, and the very real and genuine interest which they bring to bear on every other part of their work. But this fact only brings into stronger relief the position in which they choose to place the public ministration of religion. It is a pity that they should give the impression to so many people that they deliberately ignore the need for suitable provision for public worship. It is still more deplorable that they should set aside the deliberate judgment of those who have had most to do with the treatment of the insane. Most of all it is disastrous that they should even appear to wish, if they do wish, to evade a moral obligation which their chairman acknowledged to be an actual breach of faith. On these grounds, therefore, I venture to ask His Majesty's Government whether they can give us any information with regard to this matter. I hope they may be able to tell us that it is the intention of the County Council to remedy this defect, and, I think I really must say, to vindicate their honour. But, if not, I think the House has a right to ask whether His Majesty's Government intend to take any- steps in the matter with regard to putting pressure upon the West Riding County Council, and whether they will lay on the Table any correspondence between the County Council and the Home Office or the Lunacy Commissioners which would throw light upon this question. I have detained your Lordships at greater length than I intended, but I am quite sure you will feel with me that this is not a mere local question, and that if it becomes the practice, either from material considerations of economy or from any other motive which I cannot myself understand or analyse, to deprive these poor unfortunate paupers of what is acknowledged to be an almost necessary part of their treatment
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0442"/>
<col>833</col>
and of something which ought to be to them among the happiest associations of their unfortunate detention, it would be a disaster, and, more than a disaster, it would be a disgrace to the humanity of English people in connection with perhaps the most helpless class with whom we have to deal.</p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01743"><member>LORD FABER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have listened with great interest to the remarks which have fallen from the right rev. Prelate. I do not desire to traverse his statements in any way; I believe they are correct. In regard to the Menston Asylum, a very large asylum that was built in 1888, no doubt a pledge was given that a chapel should be built; and again with regard to the Storthes Hall Asylum, which was built in 1904, there was also a pledge that a chapel should be built. The gentleman who was chairman of the West Riding County Council for many years and who gave up the chairmanship last year is a man of well-known position and very well liked and respected in the West Riding of Yorkshire. This gentleman is now chairman of the committee which deals with these asylums, and that is a point to be remembered. I do not presume for a moment to say whether or not chapels are a valuable addition to an asylum. Probably they are. Still, there is something to be said as regards that on the other side; and I do say without fear of contradiction that especially in the West Riding of Yorkshire asylums are very necessary indeed, whether chapels are necessary or not. More than that, an Asylum Board such as is proposed in the Bill shortly to be brought before your Lordships' House and to which the right rev. Prelate referred is also very necessary, as it will lead to great economies in the conduct of those asylums. The West Riding of Yorkshire has to deal with a great amount of lunacy, and it is, therefore, an important matter to see that the finance in regard to these asylums is sufficiently looked after. But there remains above everything the promises given on both occasions that chapels should be built. I
<col>834</col>
do not desire to argue against the fulfilment of those promises, and I think I may say that if the Lord Bishop will be good enough to have a little conversation with the chairman of the Asylums Board it is possible, nay I think it is probable, he will arrive at a solution of this vexed question. I hope that will be so, because I feel that there is a very big question behind this, and that nothing should be allowed to interfere with the proper development of asylums such as these great institutions in the West Riding of Yorkshire.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01744"><sup>*</sup><member>THE PAYMASTER-GENERAL (LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I confess that the attitude of the West Riding lunacy authorities, which has been so clearly and so forcibly described by the right rev. Prelate, is inexplicable, more especially as o it stands practically alone and there is no reason for supposing that it represents the general public opinion in the West Riding. I may say, my Lords, that the Lunacy Commissioners and the Secretary of State are as much impressed as the right rev. Prelate with the desirability of asylums being provided with proper chapels. That has always been their attitude and they have always held it. For some time the Lunacy Commissioners and the Secretary of State have been aware of the attitude taken up by the West Riding County Council on this question, and they have from time to time, as the right rev. Prelate said, urged upon the Visiting Committees and the General Asylums Committee the desirability of providing these chapels.<lb/>
In 1910 the Home Office, at the instigation of the Lunacy Commissioners, wrote to the Storthes Hall Visiting Committee and drew their attention to the fact that they had neither provided the chapel, the plan for which was included in the plans approved by the Secretary of State, nor appointed a paid chaplain, which they are obliged to do by the Lunacy Act of 1890. A chaplain has since been appointed but so far no steps have been taken towards providing a chapel. In November, 1910, the Secretary of State wrote a letter to the West Riding General Asylums Committee urging again that these chapels should be provided at Menston, Scalebor Park, and. Storthes Hall. The only definite reply received was a letter of March 27, 1911, to the effect that adequate arrangements had been made for holding services for all denominations at the three asylums,
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0443"/>
<col>835</col>
and that the committees of the three asylums did not see their way to erect chapels. On receiving that reply, which practically amounts to a refusal to comply with the request, the Secretary of State consulted the Law Officers of the Crown as to what his powers were. The Law Officers advised that it is a requirement of the Lunacy Act of 1890 that the local authority shall provide asylum accommodation of the kind approved by the Secretary of State, and therefore if the Secretary of State requires a chapel to be erected as part of the asylum accommodation the local authority must build a chapel. That being the view of the Law Officers of the Crown as to the powers of the Secretary of State, my right hon. friend has now taken the step of issuing a requisition to the General Asylums Committee of the County Council calling upon them to fulfil this obligation. It may interest your Lordships to hear the terms of the requisition. It is as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"To the County Council of the West Riding of Yorkshire: Whereas you, the Council of the administrative county of the West Riding of Yorkshire, are a local authority within the meaning of the Lunacy Act, 1890. And whereas the Commissioners in Lunacy have, pursuant to Section 247 of the said Act, reported to me as Secretary of State that you the said Council have failed to satisfy the requirements of the said Act as regards asylum accommodation in that you have not provided suitable chapels for the celebration of Divine service at Menston, Storthes Hall, and Scalebor Park asylums being asylums maintained by you under the said Act. Now I, the said Secretary of State, do hereby, pursuant to the section, require you the said Council as such local authority to provide such chapels, in the case of the said Storthes Hall Asylum in accordance with the plans and contracts approved by the Secretary of State in the month of May, 1905, pursuant to the said Act, and in the case of the said Menston and Scalebor Park Asylums in accordance with plans and contracts to be submitted by you to the said Commissioners and to a Secretary of State and to be approved by the said Secretary of State pursuant to the said Act. And I do further hereby require you pursuant to the said section in the case of the said last two mentioned asylums to submit plans and contracts accordingly."</quote></membercontribution></p>

Prelate upon the complete success which has attended his effort to bring this matter before your Lordships' House. There has been virtually no defence for the conduct of the West Riding County Council in this matter. Their conduct was admitted just now by the noble Lord who spoke for the Home Office to be inexplicable, and he did not deny that they had evaded what evidently in his opinion and in the opinion of the Department was a legal obligation which rested with them. The right rev. Prelate established his case so thoroughly that I am certainly not going to follow him over the history of the matter, but it is perfectly clear that the general practice has been to provide chapels at these great asylums, and that the only failure to do so has taken place in regard to these two asylums in which the local authority was plainly and deliberately recalcitrant. The pledges given that the chapel accommodation should be provided were distinct. They were embodied in resolutions which are on record, and it seems to me that the refusal of the County Council amounted to a very cynical disregard of their obligations. May I be permitted to say how entirely I agree with what was said by the right rev. Prelate as to the impropriety of using recreation rooms for this purpose. I am no lawyer, but I will take upon myself confidently to say that when an Act of Parliament says that a chapel "or some other convenient place" is to be provided for Divine worship, that does not mean merely a place in which there is a certain amount of standing or sitting room. It means a place appropriate for Divine worship&#x2014;a place, if I may use the right rev. Prelate's own expression, proper and decent for use
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0444"/>
<col>837</col>
as a place of worship; and nobody, I venture to say, will be found to contend that a room which is ordinarily used for the purpose of dances or variety entertainments can by any stretch of language be described as a convenient place in which to celebrate public worship. There is another matter upon which I do not think the right rev. Prelate touched, but obviously in a large institution of this kind you would have to take into account, not only the unfortunate inmates, but also the very large staff who have to attend upon them, and these people also seem to me entitled to proper recognition. We heard with great satisfaction that the Secretary of State has determined, rather late in the day, to put pressure upon the County Council.

On that occasion I placed the names of four magistrates on the Paper, and in respect of two of them the noble Lord (Lord Ashby St. Ledgers) who spoke on behalf of the Irish Office said that sufficient notice of the Question had not been given, and therefore he could not make any statement then in regard to those two magistrates. I think there has now been sufficient notice given, and therefore I will proceed to deal with the two cases mentioned in my Notice to-day.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01756">The first case is that of Mr. Eugene O'Sullivan. He was returned as Member of Parliament for East Kerry, but this election was followed by an election petition, there being charges of corrupt and illegal practices said to have been committed at that election. The Judges who tried the case found that corrupt practices were proved to have been committed with the knowledge and consent of the said Eugene O'Sullivan, and that the nature of such corrupt practices was &#x2014;
<quote>"undue influence and intimidation exercised in order to induce voters to vote for the said Eugene O'Sullivan or to refrain from voting for the petitioner, John Murphy."</quote>
The election was declared void, and, curiously enough, shortly after that Mr. Eugene O'Sullivan was made a Justice of the Peace for the county of Kerry. But there was something further. Mr. Justice Kenny, who with Mr. Justice Madden tried the East Kerry election petition case, said in delivering judgment&#x2014;
<quote>"The Firies district a quarter of a century ago was the scene of a terrible crime. It is hard to credit any decent law-abiding person identifying
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0445"/>
<col>839</col>
himself with that terrible outrage, yet we find the respondent (Eugene O'Sullivan) delivering a speech of a very shocking character in connection with moonlighting in the Firies district."</quote>
And Mr. Justice Madden said that of the speech of Mr. Eugene O'Sullivan and the sentiments that prompted it there could be only one opinion amongst those who had any respect for the law or any regard for the good fame of the county of Kerry. I believe that Mr. Eugene O'Sullivan is still a Justice of the Peace.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01757">The Statute with regard to this question seems to be quite clear. It was quoted in the debate on March 14 by the noble Earl, Lord Desart. What it says is this&#x2014;
<quote>"if a candidate is reported for treating or undue influence he is subject to the same incapacities as if at the date of the report he had been convicted on indictment of corrupt practice."</quote>
And another section runs&#x2014;
<quote>"A person convicted on indictment of corrupt practice shall for seven years not be capable of holding any public or judicial office, and if he holds any such office the office shall be vacated."</quote>
In the interpretation clause a judicial office includes a Justice of the Peace. I think it is little short of a scandal, first of all that this man should have been made a Justice of the Peace after having been found guilty of corrupt practices, and then that the authorities, with that Statute before them, should have allowed him to continue on the Commission of the Peace.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01758">I will now take the case of Mr. John Sweeny, of Burton Port, County Donegal. Mr. Sweeny is a public-house keeper. In 1899 he was convicted of selling methylated spirits without a licence, and in 1905 he was convicted of keeping his public-house open during prohibited hours. And then he was made a Justice of the Peace&#x0021;But even after that he was fined&#x00A3;50for the illegal sale of intoxicating liquors at his unlicensed hotel in Burton Port, but the fine was reduced by the magistrates to&#x00A3;12 10<i>s</i>., with a recommendation by the Bench&#x2014;this is a little habit they have in Ireland&#x2014;that the amount be further reduced to 10<i>s</i>. He did this again in the same year and was fined in the same way; and last August he was again fined for selling watered rum. Now when you buy rum you like to get it neat and to add water yourself, but this gentleman charged the full price for rum having watered it first of all. That is Mr. John Sweeny's record,
<col>840</col>
and I ask any respectable person. Is it right that a man should remain a magistrate who had been convicted of two offences before he was made a Justice of the Peace and then goes on in this way, finishing up with selling watered rum? In my opinion it is perfectly disgraceful and scandalous and I hope I shall have some sort of satisfactory answer from the Government on the subject.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01759">To show your Lordships how very slack the authorities are in this matter I may mention that Mr. Gilhooly, M.P., was removed from the Commission of the Peace for a speech which he delivered on the occasion of the trial and conviction of a number of persons for participating in the riots of Bantry on August 14, 1910; but he was subsequently chosen as chairman of the local district council, and thereupon became an <i>ex officio</i> Justice of the Peace. A great many people have speculated very much as to what would be the action of the Lord Chancellor of Ireland on that matter. Here was a man who was removed from the Commission of the Peace for making a speech with regard to riots but who afterwards became an <i>ex officio</i> magistrate, and no notice whatever was taken. I put that case in by way of parenthesis to show how very slack, to say the least of it, the authorities in Ireland are with regard to Justices of the Peace.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01760">The noble Lord, Lord Ashby St. Ledgers, in replying to me on the previous occasion when I called attention to this matter, said, referring to the debate the previous day on the subject of the Congested Districts Board and Mr. Fitzgibbon, M.P.&#x2014;
<quote>"The Motion of the noble Earl is another instance, of which we had an example yesterday, of the drastic and disciplinary action which noble Lords opposite are always urging the Government of Ireland to adopt towards people who happen to be their political opponents."</quote>
I really do not care a pin whether these men are Nationalists or Unionists. It is a perfect disgrace to the country that they should be retained as Justices of the Peace. These men are placed in responsible positions, in many cases in out-of-the-way districts, and it is the greatest possible evil to a country when there is not respect for the magistracy. There was no political motive whatever in my mind in raising this question. But is it any palliation of the non-action of His Majesty's Government to say that I am making
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0446"/>
<col>841</col>
political capital out of it? I venture to say that if Justices of the Peace were to do this sort of thing in England the noble and learned Earl now on the Woolsack would have them off the Commission of the Peace at once and without any hesitation. There is no political question involved at all. It is a question of maintaining decent benches of magistrates and carrying out the law in a proper and respectable manner. I await with the greatest interest the answer which the noble Lord opposite will give. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01761"><i>Moved</i>, That there be laid before the House the findings of the Court in the East Kerry Election Petition and the Judges' statement relating thereto, and the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown with reference to the retention by Mr. Eugene O'Sullivan of the office of Justice of the Peace.&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Mayo.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01762"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl has to-day brought forward the two names which I asked him to defer when he raised this question on March 14 because he had not given me sufficient notice to enable me to go into the merits of those cases, and I am obliged to hint for having deferred them until to-day. The noble Earl has told your Lordships what he knows about these two gentlemen. Some of the things he has told you are accurate; others, perhaps are not quite so accurate. But before going into the individual cases I would like to make a protest against the attempt he has made to-day and made before to set up something of what I may call a cumulative case against these and other individuals. I submit, and I hope the House will agree with me, that there is a broad distinction between offences committed prior to an individual being elevated to the Bench and those committed after his appointment. Noble Lords laugh, but I think they are laughing a little too soon.<lb/>
I would remind the House that there are in Ireland, apart from the official and resident magistrates who do not come within the scope of this discussion, two classes of magistrates. There are the ordinary magistrates, appointed by the Lord Chancellor either as the result of his own selection or, more frequently, I believe, on the recommendation of some responsible person like the Lieutenant of a county, and there is also another
<col>842</col>
class of magistrates&#x2014;namely, <i>ex officio</i> magistrates who owe their position on the Bench to the Local Government Act of 1898 which was passed by noble Lords opposite. As far as this second class is concerned, it was held by Lord Ashbourne, when he was Lord Chancellor, and it has been held by his successors, that the Lord Chancellor was precluded from taking into consideration any act of commission or omission on the part of any gentleman previously to the attainment of that position. When we discussed this subject before the Easter recess Lord Ashbourne was in his place, and I asked him whether he remembered the case of Mr. Kelly, an Irish magistrate. I do not know what Mr. Kelly had done, but he was the subject of a Question in another place in the year 1905, when Mr. Walter Long was Chief Secretary for Ireland. In reply, Mr, Long said&#x2014;
<quote>"I have referred this Question to the Lord Chancellor, whose observations are as follows: Mr. Kelly became a magistrate under the provisions of the Local Government Act without the need of any previous sanction or approval from the Lord Chancellor, and he only thereon became amenable to the jurisdiction of the word Chancellor under the enactment which places him in the same position as other Irish magistrates with regard to conduct after he became a magistrate. But this power does not authorise the Lord Chancellor to inquire into speeches made several months before his election."</quote>
That was the attitude taken up by Lord Ashbourne when he was Lord Chancellor. It is, if I may venture to say so with great respect, an absolutely unanswerable position, and it is one which has been followed by successive Lord Chancellors. Therefore when noble Lords opposite laughed when I said there was a broad and important distinction to be drawn between acts committed before and acts committed after gentlemen came upon the Bench in Ireland I think they had forgotten that this <i>ex officio</i> class of magistrates existed. Certainly the noble Earl, Lord Mayo, seems to have forgotten it, for he said, alluding to the case of Mr. O'Sullivan, that after that gentleman had made certain inflammatory speeches he was made a magistrate. He was not made a magistrate. He became a magistrate by virtue of the Act of 1898. And I go further and say that, even as regards ordinary magistrates, charges and convictions previously to their becoming magistrates ought not to weigh unduly with the Lord Chancellor when he is called upon to consider the gravity of any particular
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0447"/>
<col>843</col>
offence or charge that may be brought against an individual since his appointment. If that is so, and I believe it is, a great part, if not the major part, of the noble Earl's indictment against these people falls to the ground. In the case of Mr. O'Sullivan the violent speeches to which the noble Earl alluded were made years before this gentleman ever came upon the Bench.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01763"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: He made another speech.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01764"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: I am coming to that. Let me emphasise again that Mr. O'Sullivan was not appointed by the Lord Chancellor. The noble Earl spoke as if the Lord Chancellor had elected him and put him on the Bench. He became a Justice of the Peace by reason of his election as chairman of the Killarney Urban District Council. I am pretty sure, if it had been a question of appointing him, that the speeches to which reference has been made would have been taken into consideration and he would not have been appointed. Then there is the question of the election petition. The noble Earl has quoted the Statute, and he feels quite certain in his own mind that under the terms of the Statute Mr. Eugene O'Sullivan ought to be removed from the Bench. But here he comes into conflict with the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown. When Mr. O'Sullivan became a magistrate as I have described by <i>ex officio</i> process, the attention of the Lord Chancellor was called to the matter of the election petition, and he had to decide whether the conviction was such as would deprive this gentleman of his position.<lb/>
It is a very long technical story. I do not know whether the House would like me to give it to them in full, or whether your Lordships would be content if I summarise it by saying that the Law Officers of the Crown advised that as Mr. O'Sullivan had not been reported to have been personally guilty of corrupt practices under Section 4 of the Act of 1883 he had not become subject to the incapacities imposed by Section 6, one of which is incapacity to hold a judicial office, which includes the office of Justice of the Peace. That being so, the Lord Chancellor of Ireland did not consider that it was his duty to remove Mr. O'Sullivan, and I doubt very much whether, in view of this
<col>844</col>
opinion of the Law Officers, he would have been right in doing so. That is the case of Mr. O'Sullivan.<lb/>
I pass to the case of Mr. John Sweeny. Mr. Sweeny is not an <i>ex officio</i> magistrate. He was appointed by the Lord Chancellor in 1908 upon the recommendation of the Duke of Abercorn, who apparently did not make sufficiently careful and exhaustive inquiries into Mr. Sweeny's previous career before he took upon himself the step of recommending his name to the Lord Chancellor. Anyhow, Mr. Sweeny was appointed on the recommendation of the Duke of Abercorn. I may say that the Lord Chancellor was not aware that Mr. Sweeny was the owner of licensed premises. He was recommended to him as a hotel keeper, and he was not aware, as a matter of fact, that he was the owner of licensed premises, not that that would necessarily have been an insuperable bar to his appointment. Since then it is true that Mr. Sweeny has been convicted of two offences in connection with his unlicensed hotel. It appears that one of the Revenue officers stopped at Mr. Sweeny's hotel, and, being a zealous gentleman and wishing to probe into the practice which obtained in this unlicensed house, called for whisky and beer, but, contrary to the practice adopted in unlicensed hotels, he was not called upon at the time for the money with which to procure the drink from outside and the cost was included in his bill. For that Mr. Sweeny was fined the nominal sum of 10<i>s</i>. The Lord Chancellor, however, regarded this as only a technical breach of the law, because if the revenue officer had been called upon to put down his shilling at the time he called for the drink there would have been no breach of the law; and after considering the circumstances and having regard to the decision of the magistrates the late Lord Chancellor came to the conclusion that no action on his part was necessary. The second case was one of selling spirits below proof. Here, again, it was held that although Mr. Sweeny was legally responsible he was not personally connected with this offence, and there was no proof that he had any cognisance of it. That was the police report on the subject. It occurred at a public house of his at a place where he did not reside, and there was no evidence that Mr. Sweeny was the offender. He might have been, indeed, the person sinned against. The wholesale dealer might have supplied him with the
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0448"/>
<col>845</col>
rum watered, There was certainly no evidence that Mr. Sweeny was aware that he was selling spirit below proof. Again in view of that fact the Lord Chancellor did not think it necessary to interfere.<lb/>
These two cases form part of a batch of five which were originally submitted to this House by the noble Earl. I think we may feel that we have reached the limit of delinquencies which the zeal and industry of the noble Earl has been able to unearth. These five cases represent the sum total of the alleged unsatisfactory condition of the Irish Benches which deprives them of that respect to which the noble Earl rightly attaches importance. What are they? In two cases the gentlemen had already been removed before the noble Earl drew attention to them. Then there is the case of Mr. O'Sullivan, who was not liable under the Act to be deprived of his office. Only two cases remain&#x2014;that of Mr. Scott, who was fined 1<i>s</i>. for being intoxicated, and Mr. Sweeny, who has been guilty of two offences of a technical character. On the last occasion on which we discussed this subject the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition took the opportunity to base upon it, as far as I could gather, a general charge against the reliability and respectability of the Irish Benches. I have not the noble Marquess's words, but I think the substance of his observations was that many of the local Benches are at the present moment recruited in such a manner that nothing but a denial of justice can be expected from them in a certain class of eases.<lb/>
If the Irish Benches are unsatisfactory, the most unsatisfactory elements are the <i>ex officio</i> magistrates who come upon the Bench by virtue of the Act of 1898 passed by a Conservative Government. However good your recruiting for the rest of the Bench may be, it is always liable to be very largely diluted by the <i>ex officio</i> magistrates who come upon it in the way I have described. For instance, there is the case of. Mr. Gilhooly, M.P., who was rightly deprived of his position on the Bench, but who reappears as an <i>ex officio</i> magistrate. But who is responsible for that? Not His Majesty's Government, not the Irish Administration, but noble Lords opposite and their colleagues in another place who passed the Act of 1898. In so far as the honour and the reputation of the Irish
<col>846</col>
Benches are compromised by these gentlemen, if any one is responsible for it it is the Party opposite. I do not know whether the noble Marquess will go further into that question to-day, but if he does I am sure he will bear in mind the distinction which does exist and should be emphasised between magistrates appointed by the Lord Chancellor and magistrates who come to the Bench in an <i>ex officio</i> capacity hope that we have now got to the bottom of the serious and disquieting charges which the noble Earl makes against the Irish Benches.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01765"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords the noble Lord who has just addressed the House was good enough to refer to some observations which I made in this place on the 14th of last month, and he seemed to be under the impression that the complaint which I then undoubtedly did make was founded upon somewhat imperfect knowledge limited to some half-a-dozen cases in which acts more or less improper had been committed by individual magistrates sitting on the Irish local Benches. But if the noble Lord had been good enough to refer to the report of what I then said he would have observed that, far from resting myself merely upon half-a-dozen individual cases of that kind, I really based my argument upon quotations from language used by two learned Judges and one right rev. Prelate in Ireland. The two learned Judges&#x2014;Judge Todd and Judge Craig&#x2014;both spoke in the strongest language, and in general language not limited to any particular cases, of the conduct of some of these Irish Benches. Judge Todd said&#x2014;
<quote>"It made him ashamed that some gentlemen, after the evidence which had been sworn before them, should act contrary to it."</quote>
That is a pretty severe and sweeping condemnation of a Bench. Judge Craig said&#x2014;
<quote>"It was a disgrace to the administration of justice, and if the people who appointed such magistrates could only see them, they would be ashamed of themselves."</quote>
Similar remarks were made by the right rev. Prelate whom I quoted.<lb/>
The noble Lord begged me to keep in mind the distinction between offences committed by these persons before and after their appointment as magistrates. I do not want in the least to rake up the old records of every gentleman who succeeds in finding his place on an Irish Bench of
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0449"/>
<col>847</col>
magistrates, but I do say this, that when the record of a particular individual before his appointment is anything but a clean record, it becomes necessary to look with somewhat critical eye on his conduct after he has obtained a seat on the Bench, and in the case of certainly two of the persons referred to by Lord Mayo he was able to say that their conduct both before and after their appointment to the Bench had been of a kind which in the judgment of most people would render them very unfit indeed to administer justice. In particular there is the case of Mr. Sweeny, who was twice convicted before and twice after his appointment to the Bench. The noble Lord seemed to be under the impression that this gentleman was an <i>ex officio</i> magistrate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01766"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: No; he was appointed on the recommendation of the Duke of Abercorn.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01767"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: In his case the story is a perfectly clear and simple one. There were two convictions before his appointment, of which I suppose the Lord Lieutenant was not aware, and there have been two convictions since. The fact that these two earlier convictions preceded the two which took place subsequently to his appointment seems to me to show the later offences should not have been condoned, and that the retention of Mr. Sweeny as an administrator of justice is not for the public interest. But I do not want to pass again in review these different cases. What I do wish to impress upon the House is that enough has been established to show that some inquiry into this question of the conduct of the Irish local magistrates is really necessary. We have had an inquiry dealing with the question of the magistracy in this country, and, as the noble and learned Earl on the Woolsack knows, the question arose whether that inquiry should be extended to Ireland or not. The Prime Minister was interrogated on this point in the House of Commons, and when asked whether he would include Ireland in the inquiry, he said&#x2014;
<quote>"No, sir, I think not. The Royal Commission announced by the Lord Chancellor is intended to deal with the question of the appointment of magistrates in England, Scotland, and Wales &#x2026;When the inquiry has been concluded the Government will be glad to consider whether a similar inquiry should be held in the case of Ireland, where, I may add, the conditions differ somewhat from those in Great Britain."</quote>
<col>848</col>
Our point is that the time has come when that inquiry, of which a prospect was held out by the Prime Minister, might very well be instituted. The same point was referred to in the Report of the Royal Commission, in which the Commissioners stated, differing apparently somewhat from the Prime Minister, that the terms of their Commission would have enabled them to deal with the appointment of justices in Ireland. They added, however, that&#x2014;
<quote>"It was called to our attention that the Prime Minister had stated in the House of Commons that the inquiry was not intended to include Ireland, which might be dealt with by an independent and further inquiry."</quote>
Surely such an inquiry would not be a very unreasonable one to make. The noble and learned Earl will, I hope, permit me to quote one sentence from his own evidence before the Royal Commission&#x2014;
<quote>"The office of Justice of the Peace is one of great importance. It is necessary that Justices of the Peace should be men of independence, integrity, of good repute and good sense. It is not a question of social rank. What is required is that there should be general confidence in their capacity and impartiality and a personal respect for them on the part of those among whom they live."</quote>
I really would ask the noble and learned Earl, who has listened to these discussions, whether it is possible to believe that those who will attend these local Courts and who will have to go to these local Courts for justice can possibly entertain a feeling of general confidence in their capacity and impartiality and a personal respect for them so long as gentlemen of the type of Mr. Sweeny, Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. Scott, and Mr. Gilhooly are allowed to retain their places on the Bench. The matter is really one which demands further investigation, and I hope it will receive such investigation at the hands of His Majesty's Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01768"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have very few words to say in answer to the appeal made to me by the noble Marquess. I quite agree that your object is to get on the Bench men who will be respected and whose decisions in judicial matters will be looked up to. I can assure your Lordships, from the experience of six years, that with the innumerable personal jealousies and constant difficulties that arise in connection with it, the duty is an extremely difficult one to discharge by any one who holds the office of Lord Chancellor in this country or in Ireland. All that can be done is to exercise the best discretion possible in the selection of
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0450"/>
<col>849</col>
magistrates. It is still more difficult, sometimes to deal with cases of dismissal, because you are not always sure of your facts; and any one who has, as I have, to consider the question whether a man ought to continue a Justice of the Peace, especially where he has been elected by a public body to a position which makes him an <i>ex officio</i> magistrate and has not been nominated by the Lord Chancellor, has a very difficult task. He must be careful before he inflicts an irreparable stigma or disgrace upon a man whose offence may perhaps he inconsiderable. All I will say further on this subject is that I wholly decline to express any opinion as to the propriety of the conduct of the Lord Chancellor of Ireland. I have no doubt that he has fully considered the facts. I cannot know or believe that I am in possession of all the facts that were laid before him, and it would be ungenerous and wrong in me to express in this case, especially in his absence, any criticism of his action in so delicate and difficult a matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01769"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: I ended my speech with a Motion for Papers. I should like to know if we might have printed the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown with regard to the case of Mr. Eugene O'Sullivan. I was not quite clear as to what Lord Ashby St. Ledgers said upon this, and I should like to ask whether he means to say that the Lord Chancellor cannot remove an <i>ex officio</i> magistrate no matter what he may have done.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01770"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: The view taken by successive Lord Chancellors of Ireland is that the Lord Chancellor cannot take into consideration anything which had been done by a man before he became an <i>ex officio</i> magistrate. Anything that the <i>ex officio</i> magistrate may do afterwards, of course, comes within the Lord Chancellor's purview. That was laid down by Lord Ashbourne in 1905, and it has been followed ever since. I really do not know what other course is open to the Lord Chancellor. The Act which creates these <i>ex officio</i> Justices of the Peace must have contemplated that in ninny cases the personal record of the individual would not bear investigation. Noble Lords opposite must have contemplated that when they passed the Act, and presumably it was the intention of Parliament that whatever the previous record of these gentlemen was they were to sit on the Bench.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01773"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I wish the noble Lord would explain one point which arises out of what he said a moment ago. I think he said that the Law Officers believed that the Lord Chancellor could not take into account anything done by an <i>ex officio</i> magistrate before he became an <i>ex officio</i> magistrate. Take the case of Mr. Gilhooly. He was au <i>ex officio</i> magistrate, and was removed from the Bench for having made a speech at Bantry in August, 1910. Is it the view of the Government that in a case of that kind the Lord Chancellor is precluded from taking into consideration other acts committed by the same person before his appointment to the magistracy?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01774"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it has been my fortune, unhappily, to have had more to do with the appointment of Irish magistrates than I think any other member of your Lordships' House, and I frankly admit that it is not that portion of the public duties which have been committed to me to which I look back with the liveliest satisfaction or pleasure, and I am sure that noble Lords opposite who had the same duty to perform of nominating magistrates to the Irish Benches are equally removed from any feeling of complacency on the matter. But I would point out to the noble Marquess that when I became Chief Secretary for the second time in 1892 it was necessary, if you wanted to present to the mind of Irishmen a desire on the part of the Government to have impartial and fair Benches, to make a large number of appointments to redress the amazing inequality which existed at that moment on the Irish Benches. How were they manned? It would be a bitter story to describe to the House how those Irish Benches were manned before we came into office in 1892. It was no more than common justice and common decency required that we should make a large number of appointments. If we had had
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0451"/>
<col>851</col>
a wider choice, if the social conditions of Ireland had given us material for a wider choice, those appointments might have been different from what they were. I understand that my own humble name is associated with many of those magistrates who are obnoxious to some of the friends of the noble Marquess. That may be. But from the inquiries which I have been able to make during the intervening years I feel that on the whole justice has been as well and as impartially administered by the renovated Benches as it was under the old <i>r&#x00E9;gime</i>.<lb/>
As to the noble Marquess's request for an inquiry, it may be right to have an inquiry into the question of magistrates in England, Scotland, and Wales, but in Ireland, where the social conditions are so uncertain and in many respects unsatisfactory, I for one would deprecate the appointment of any Commission or tribunal the object of which would be to rip open a number of circumstances in Ireland which it would be better to leave alone. It is no gain to a country in the condition of Ireland to set a roving inquiry on foot upon a matter so delicate and involving so many dangerous indirect issues as the administration of justice. I hope, therefore, that the noble Marquess will not persevere in his request for an inquiry. I do not think it would be expedient; it would serve no good purpose, and it might produce a great deal of mischief.</membercontribution></p>

</ol>
<lb/>
I see by this morning's papers that it was stated yesterday in another place in reply to a Question concerning the inquiry now being held at Washington, that this was the first occasion on which a foreign Government had held an inquiry into the loss of a ship sailing under the British flag. I think the House will desire to know whether the situation is in accord with the customs of international law, and, further whether His Majesty's Government were approached with regard to the inquiry now proceeding in America before it was actually instituted. A departure of such magnitude from the practice to which we have been accustomed is of vital importance, not only to British shipping companies, but still more to the officers and men on ships sailing under the British flag. If this inquiry is taken as a precedent it is very difficult to say where we shall end. If the United States Government have already approached the responsible Department in this country it is obvious that the question of precedent must already have been raised, and in that case no doubt the House will be able to get some information on the matter.<lb/>
So far as I have been able to see, this inquiry at Washington had, perhaps, two grounds of justification. The first is that, the shipping company which owned the "Titanic" was not altogether a British company. I believe it is partly American in its management, and therefore an inquiry could be held by the country which was largely interested in the shipping concern. Obviously, if that decision is accepted it raises an extraordinary situation, because it strikes at the root of the whole question of the position of the Mercantile Marine in time of war. It is obvious that a shipping company which is under such dual management would, in time of war, promptly hoist the flag of the neutral Power if one of these Powers happened to be neutral and the other belligerent. That would raise the question, which would be difficult to deal with, as to whether the ship belonged to the neutral Power or the belligerent Power. The only other justification which might, be advanced for the inquiry in America is the terrible loss of life among American citizens. But if that is to hold good as a reason for this inquiry,
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0452"/>
<col>853</col>
it is obvious that every other nation which had citizens on board the "Titanic," who unfortunately are no more, would be justified in holding an inquiry of a similar character. To put it shortly, I can imagine nothing more deplorable for the survivors of a great disaster than to be dragged about from one country to another attending inquiries and giving evidence of an experience so awful.<lb/>
There is another point, and perhaps the most important point of all, and that is the one raised in lily third Question-namely, whether the evidence given before the Committee in the United States will be admissible as evidence at the inquiry to be held in this country. The feelings of the officers and men who have given evidence at the American inquiry are naturally worthy of great consideration; but far more important still is the result with regard to the evidence to be given at the official inquiry in this country. I believe that noble and learned Lords will agree that evidence given at a first inquiry is of far more value and is far more to be depended upon than evidence given at a later inquiry. There are obvious reasons for such a view. H the evidence given before the inquiry now being held in America is to be admissible at the official inquiry in this country, no doubt His Majesty's Government have made arrangements for an official transcript of that evidence to be made for the purpose of the inquiry to be held here. If the evidence is not to be held admissible, then the inquiry here will obviously be penalised by not being the first inquiry held into tins great disaster.<lb/>
I do not wish to go into the question of whether the American inquiry was right or wrong. Fortunately, the relations between this country and the United States are so friendly that no international question can possibly arise. Our relations with the United States Government are friendly; our relations with the people of the United States are, perhaps, even more so. But undoubtedly there is a certain amount of feeling in this country in regard to the inquiry which is now being held. I do not think that feeling is strong. It has certainly not been as forcibly worded as if the situation had been reversed. Imagine that it had been an American ship which had been lost and that we were holding an inquiry here and detaining American
<col>854</col>
citizens from going back to their own inquiry and possibly asking for documents from United States shipping companies to be laid before our inquiry. In that case I think things would be said in the United States which every one in this country would be likely to regret. Moreover if the action of the United States is to be taken as a precedent by other Powers, we may get to a serious situation indeed. If our relations with another Power were strained, and if, alas, there were a similar accident, I think we should hold very strong views indeed if we found that our citizens were being detained in that country for an inquiry into the loss of a British ship purely and simply because a number of citizens of that other Power had been aboard. Though such a disaster as this draws the whole world together, still these matters, unless threshed out before the situation arises, do give points for friction. I have therefore put these Questions on the Paper not only to elucidate the present position, but also, if possible, to make clear what is to be our position in the future.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01777"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope the noble Earl will not think me wanting in courtesy or good will if I rather wish to excuse myself as positively as I can from discussing to-day, even on the very threshold of such a discussion, a situation which is so clearly unripe. What may happen ultimately we do not know. I think the noble Earl is perfectly entitled to put down the Questions which he has put on the Paper. I have no complaint whatever to make of that. But I do contend that anything like a discussion this afternoon, here or another place, would be immature, could do no good, and might be prejudicial. The noble Earl asks, "Is there a right for another country to inquire into the circumstances of the wreck of a British ship on the high seas?" There is no doubt that any State may institute an inquiry about the wreck of a foreign vessel in which the lives of its own citizens have been lost, without any departure from international law, though we are not aware that any such case has arisen before. The answer to the second Question is simple. Communications have not been addressed to the Government of the United States, and no intimations or communications have been received from any other Powers by us. On the point of the admissibility of evidence, the Wreck Commissioner, Lord Mersey, in this country will be able to
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0453"/>
<col>855</col>
receive any information that he thinks will be useful, and will attach to it whatever weight he thinks it deserves, quite independently of what may have happened anywhere else. No doubt he will get all the most direct evidence that he can obtain in the regular course. But the inquiry that Lord Mersey undertakes is different from a trial between parties, and the rules of evidence applicable to litigation are not necessarily adhered to in an inquiry of this kind. As to the detention of witnesses, compelling witnesses to attend, and, maybe, detaining them, powers of that kind, as I am advised, exist in most countries. It is obvious that such powers, existing as they do, should be exercised with full consideration for the witnesses themselves, and also for the necessities of any inquiry at home. We cannot and do not, and I am sure the noble Earl does not, suppose that the Committee of the Senate will overlook the necessity for regard for these fair and reasonable considerations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01778"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was glad to hear the noble Viscount admit that my noble friend was justified in putting these Questions on the Paper. They relate to matters which are engaging a great amount of public attention at this moment, and they are matters with regard to which much anxiety is felt in many quarters. I feel sure that my noble friend will not disregard the appeal made to him by the noble Viscount and that he will not press more than is necessary his demand for fuller information. It seems, of course, to most people unusual and not in accordance with precedent that a ship sailing under the British flag and wrecked in mid-ocean should be made the subject of an inquiry of this kind by a foreign Power; but, on the other hand, we have to remember that the circumstances of this case are. I think I am justified in saying, wholly unparalleled both as regards the magnitude of the tragedy and the moving incidents by which it was accompanied. In these circumstances it is, perhaps, not a matter for surprise that public opinion in the United States should have been deeply stirred, and should have insisted upon some such inquiry as that which is now in progress.<lb/>
I do not think it would be quite correct to say, as my noble friend apparently suggested, that other foreign Powers stand
<col>856</col>
with regard to this question where we-stand. I do not think it can be said that any foreign Power is interested in this deplorable episode in the way in which this country and the United States are interested. There is another consideration which occurs to one&#x2014;it occurred, I think, to my noble friend&#x2014;and that is that it was not unnatural that public opinion in America should insist upon a prompt inquiry into the loss of the "Titanic," for it is clear that there is a better chance of obtaining trustworthy evidence while the events are still recent and while the vivid impressions of this lamentable occurrence are still freshly impressed upon the minds of those who were involved. With regard to the noble Viscount's statement that no diplomatic communication has been made to the Government of the United States&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01779"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: May I just say that this is not a Government inquiry, but an inquiry by the Senate. The Executive Government have, I think, nothing whatever to do with it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01780"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I am well aware of the fact that the Senate is a body which claims for itself very great independence of the Executive Government, and I do not, of course, suggest for a moment that representations should be made to the Senate. But it was stated in the House of Commons last night by the representative of His Majesty's Government that they were considering whether any diplomatic representations should be made, and it does seem to me that such communications may become necessary to this extent, at all events, that possibly British subjects who have to appear before the Senate Committee may need a certain amount of advice and assistance. I will go a little further and say that I trust it may be so arranged that the proceedings on the other side of the Atlantic will not be of a kind which will interfere with the proceedings which will have to take place on this side of the Atlantic under circumstances which to most of us suggest that the proceedings here will be more regular in form and more satisfactory in substance than those which are going on at Washington. But, my Lords, although difficulties may arise in connection with this question, I feel, as I think my noble friend feels, that public opinion on both sides of the
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0454"/>
<col>857</col>
Atlantic is sound upon this question, and that on neither side will that public opinion allow two countries connected, as we and the United States are, by the closest ties and also, in this case, by a common sorrow, to fail in their obligations either to the living or to the dead owing to any mere technicalities of international procedure or etiquette.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01781"><member>LORD ST. DAVIDS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to ask the noble Viscount on the Front Bench a further Question on this subject. The noble Earl on the other side of the House, in putting these Questions, stated that British subjects had been "detained" in the United States for the purposes of this inquiry. I take it that the word "detained" in this kind of case would usually mean detained by some process of law. I should like to ask the noble Viscount whether, as a matter of fact, that is so. From a perusal of the reports in the newspapers I gather that the Committee of the Senate had detained these individuals by a statement that if they had not got a legal right to detain them they had a right to do so as the people who owned the harbours. I believe that was the exact expression used. I should like to ask the noble Viscount whether, as a matter of fact, any British subjects have, against their will, been detained in the United States for the purpose of this inquiry. I concur with the sentiment expressed by the noble Marquess that no attempt to get at the facts of this wholly deplorable matter should be hampered by technicalities, but I think it is vital to remember that the "Titanic" was only technically a British ship. She sailed, it is true, under the British flag, but to the best of my belief the company that owned her is entirely and absolutely controlled by an American corporation. The American Shipping Trust undoubtedly owns and controls this Line and can do exactly what it likes with it, although technically it is a British company and flies the British flag. It seems to me that although the "Titanic" flew the British flag, that is a technicality which ought not unduly to weigh with us when we know that it was owned by a foreign company. I
<col>858</col>
cannot help hoping that as the result of the inquiry which is to be held in this country there may be an agreement between the nations of the world that the state of things under which a ship is technically owned in one country and controlled in another should no longer exist, but that the flag and ownership should go together.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01782"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there are one or two observations that I should have liked to make on this occasion, but after what the noble Viscount has said as to the inappropriateness of at this moment interfering, I abstain from doing so. The national character of a ship is by no means a technicality. It is a matter of supreme importance, and a supposed jurisdiction of all the world would be absolutely intolerable. I do not want to enter into a discussion of the matter after what the noble Viscount has said. I feel it cannot do any good, and it might do some mischief.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01783"><member>VISCOUNT MORL</member><membercontribution>: I am sure my noble friend behind me (Lord St. Davids) does not expect me to follow him into the large and serious questions with which he dealt. But in reply to the question which the noble Lord put to me, all I can say is that we are in communication naturally with our Ambassador, and up to to-day, or at all events yesterday, our Ambassador has received no appeal from any British subject desiring protection against detention, arrest, or anything else. That is the extent of our knowledge.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01827" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01828">Order of the Day for the Second Beading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01829"><member>THE FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Bill to which I ask your Lordships to give a Second Reading this afternoon is chiefly a Consolidation Bill, but there is also other matter connected with it upon which I should like, with your Lordships' permission, to say a few words. Parts I and II of the Bill deal only with the consolidation of the Acts passed, I think, on three separate occasions dealing with this subject. Part III is the part of the Bill which deals with the new powers for which I ask your Lordships to give authority this afternoon. The first and in some ways, perhaps, the most important provision is the extension given to the definition of "ancient monuments." We quite feel that we include in this term things which may be neither ancient nor monuments, but which at the same time we think under certain circumstances it ought to be within the power of the Commissioners of Works to preserve, and, if necessary, even to buy. Your Lordships will see that the definition is very carefully guarded and is not likely to be abused.<lb/>
The special extension of powers for which we ask is connected with compulsory powers conferred upon the Commissioners of Works, but though we ask that they should be compulsory we have, I hope, put a sufficient number of safeguards into the
<col>864</col>
Bill to ensure that they should not be exercised in any harsh or improper manner. Your Lordships will see that we propose to proceed in this matter by Preservation Order. The Preservation Order must first of all be recommended by the Board which we set up in the Schedule of this Bill, and when it is recommended the Commissioners of Works issue the Preservation Order, and then they have to bring in a Bill for confirming the Order. Your Lordships will see that by Clause 6, subsection (3), we provide that the procedure shall be in the ordinary way. There will be a Bill introduced, which will probably be called a Preservation Order Confirmation Bill, and if there is any opposition to it on the part either of the owner or any other person interested it will be dealt with by a Select Committee of the House practically in accordance with the ordinary procedure of your Lordships' House with regard to Private Bills; so that there will be every opportunity on the part of an owner who thinks himself aggrieved to come to this House for protection. This is a power which is, I think, given to other Departments. It is not an entirely new feature in our legislation, and therefore I venture to hope that your Lordships may allow it to pass. The alternative is difficult to find. Various alternatives were before my mind prior to deciding to recommend this particular course to your Lordships, but I do not think there is any other alternative possible which will give the aggrieved owner such complete protection as allowing him to come before either House of Parliament in this particular way.<lb/>
Then we ask for compulsory powers to enable us to repair buildings where in our opinion they are, owing to neglect, getting into bad repair. We also ask for power to purchase monuments&#x2014;perhaps not so much a power to purchase as a right of pre-emption. As your Lordships will see in Clause 7, subsection (3), it is only when the owner wishes to sell the monument that the Commissioners of Works have power to buy instead of allowing the monument, which may be of real value and interest, to be carried out of the country and set up somewhere abroad. In such cases we should not buy unless we were perfectly certain that it was desirable to purchase; and it is only in those special cases where the owner wishes to sell to somebody else that we would in any way have a right of entry at all. That is to
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0458"/>
<col>865</col>
say, this Bill will in no way affect an owner who does not wish to sell his property; it is only when he entertains the idea of selling his property that the State conies in with a right of pre-emption.<lb/>
The only other matter in this Bill to which I need draw your Lordships' attention is the First Schedule, which enumerates the bodies that are to have representatives upon the Board. It is not a fixed schedule. I have had a communication from the County Councils Association saying that they think they should be represented upon that body, and I think that is not at all an unreasonable request. The suggestion which I wish to make to your Lordships if this Bill is read a second time this afternoon is that it should be referred, with the other Bills on the same subject, to a Select Committee of both Houses of Parliament. There is another Bill on the Table of your Lordships' House for Second Reading to-day, and there is a further Bill down for Second Heading on Thursday next. What I venture to suggest is that all three Bills should be referred to a Select Joint Committee, and it would be quite probable, I think, that the members of the Committee would find in one of the other two Bills some ideas which ought to be incorporated in this, the principal, measure. If they do, nobody would be more pleased than myself, because I am fully aware of the difficulty of the subject and of the fact that there very likely are other provisions perhaps going further, and some, perhaps, not going quite so far, which ought to be incorporated in this Bill. I venture in the circumstances to ask your Lordships to give the Bill a Second Reading this afternoon on the understanding that it should afterwards be referred to a Select Committee of both Houses.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01831"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF RUTLAND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, later on the Paper this afternoon is an Ancient Monuments Protection Bill standing in the name of Lord Southwark upon which I have an Amendment, on the Motion for the Second Reading, to move that; that Bill be read a second time this day six months; and as I understand from the speech of the noble Karl opposite that the Bill standing in the name of Lord Southwark is to be referred with this Bill to a Joint Committee, perhaps I may be allowed, although it is a little irregular, to
<col>866</col>
allude, in the few remarks which I shall make, to Lord Southwark's Bill as well as to the one which Lord Beauchamp has just moved.<lb/>
I take no exception to Part I and Part II of the Government's Bill, because, after all, those two Parts practically consolidate the existing legislation on the subject. But there are in Part III certain provisions which require considerable consideration before some of us can view them with a favourable eye. As, however, the whole subject will be considered by a Joint Committee this is hardly the time to go into details, but I would briefly call your Lordships' attention to one or two of the matters in the Bill which appear to me to be worthy of some remark before the Bill leaves this stage in your Lordships' House. One of the principal provisions is that under which a sale is to be effected if the owner so desires, and, as the noble Earl said, the State is given a right of pre-emption. The clause as it stands practically places one Government Department in the position of fixing the price at which another Government Department is to purchase. That might on occasions prove a little hard on the owner, who might, and very probably would, get a considerably larger price in the open market. There are many conditions under which unfortunate owners of various kinds of property have to effect sales in these days; and although I am one of the last to wish that any monument of real national value should leave this country, still I do think there are times when a certain amount of consideration should be shown to an owner who through no fault of his own is obliged to part with his property.<lb/>
There is a great tendency nowadays to set up State interference with private property, and it is a moot point how far that can be carried without inflicting unnecessary and sometimes almost brutal hardship on owners. Your Lordships are aware of the conditions which obtain with regard to the sale of articles of national interest in Italy, and I do rot think there can be any question that serious harm and considerable hardship have accrued to the owners of some of those articles by their being prevented under the existing Italian law from disposing of them outside their own country. Not only is there in such cases hardship to the owners but also to
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0459"/>
<col>867</col>
the unfortunate people who live on the owners' estates, and who are by this action prevented from getting any help or assistance from the money that might be obtained from the sale of works of art. Therefore, my Lords, I hope that, whatever ultimate result may be come to by the Joint Committee after the consideration of this matter, some little consideration&#x2014;I will not put it higher than that&#x2014;will be given to the question of how the price will be fixed for the sale of ancient monuments and by whom and in what way any decision on that point may be arrived at.<lb/>
There are several other points, but they are more fitted for discussion at another stage of the Bill. I would only point out that considerable difficulty may arise, in connection with alterations which it may be necessary to carry out to some of these buildings in a hurry, should the exact wording of the Preservation Order stand as now drafted. I myself had an experience where immediate repairs were necessary to prevent a very great building catastrophe taking place, and if two months' notice had had to be given, as is proposed in this Bill, before anything could have been done, by that time one side of Haddon would have fallen to the ground. As these Bills are to be referred to a Joint Committee of both Houses I shall withdraw my opposition to Lord Southwark's Bill, and shall follow with great interest the proceedings of the Committee which it is proposed to set up.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01832"><member>LORD BURGHCLERE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as the noble Duke has said, if these Bills are to be referred to a Select Committee it is not necessary for us at the present moment to criticise their provisions in any detail. But as I have the honour of being Chairman of the Royal Commission on Ancient Monuments in England, one clause in whose Report this Bill in some way carries out, I hope I may be allowed for a few moments to address your Lordships on this subject. The recommendations which the Commission made were only two. The first was that if it is necessary, as we were led to believe it is necessary, to interfere in any way and deal with what were called imperilled monuments, it was essential that that duty and that responsibility should not rest upon any outside body, but should rest upon a Minister responsible to the Crown, who would have to defend the action that he took in Parliament and be responsible for
<col>868</col>
those moneys which it would be necessary to obtain from the State. Our second recommendation was that the Minister should be assisted by an Advisory Committee of the best experts obtainable on this particularly difficult and technical subject. Those two recommendations, which were contained in the first Report of our Commission on the county of Hertford, the Commission is responsible for, but it is in no way responsible for the manner in which those recommendations are carried out in this Bill.<lb/>
The Commission over which I preside was asked to go down to many parts of the country and look at monuments which were said to be in a disastrous condition. I believe it was the impression of the public that the Commission had power in some way to deal with these monuments and prevent their destruction, or, indeed, their sale. I need not remind your Lordships that the Commission has no such power. It has no power whatever over imperilled monuments except that it may place such monuments in the Schedule of its Report to His Majesty as monuments worthy of preservation. But although in the limited area which we have already examined I can honestly say I know of no monument in the exact condition which would render necessary compulsory intervention by the State; yet we knew at the same time, from our individual knowledge and from information we obtained from outside, that there was a condition of things which required the interference of the State&#x2014;that is to say, if the State wished to preserve its ancient and historic monuments.<lb/>
With regard to the Bill itself, I do not wish in any way to criticise it. In my humble opinion it is a very moderate Bill. I do not say that its details and method of working might not be altered with advantage. Some of my enthusiastic friends who feel deeply on the subject of the preservation of ancient monuments will think that the Bill does not go far enough. I do not say that is my opinion, but I have no doubt there are many who think we ought to go further, and, I hope, not fare worse. There is one provision in the Bill to which my noble friend who moved the Second Reading did not allude &#x2014;I refer to subsection (4) of Clause 14, which deals with the powers of His Majesty by Order in Council. As I understand, that refers to what I will call the penal
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0460"/>
<col>869</col>
clauses of the Bill&#x2014;the penalties inflicted on people who wantonly injure monuments. This subsection provides that&#x2014;
<quote>"His Majesty may, by Order in Council, declare that this section shall apply to any monument specified in the Order which appears to His Majesty to be an ancient monument within the meaning of the Act, and on any such Order being made this section shall apply accordingly."</quote>
This will give the Government of the day power to declare any monument to come under the penal clauses of this Bill. But, on the other hand, I do not understand whether the penal clauses would come into effect against the owner of the monument. As I understand the rest of the Bill, the owner of the monument is not subject to the penal clauses for destroying the monument of which he is the owner unless the monument has been taken over by the State or is under a Preservation Order. I do not understand whether, when His Majesty in Council determines that a monument shall come under this section, the monument is protected from its owner as Well as from the general public. As to the penalty which is imposed upon those who injure monuments, I cannot say that it is excessive. A penalty of&#x00A3;5 might very well deter those iniquitous persons who chop off pieces of historical monuments and carry them away and engrave their names on monuments, but I do not think a&#x00A3;5 penalty would deter a malicious person who wished to destroy his own monument in order to spite those who brought forward compulsory proceedings. I allude to that because I think it is a subject to which my noble friend might give his attention.<lb/>
Then there is the difficulty, which my noble friend knows as well as I do, as to the definition of the word "monument." My noble friend has very wisely made this rather wide and at the same time rather loose. In this Bill he defines the expression as including any monument the preservation of which is a matter of public interest by reason of the historical, architectural, traditional, artistic, or archaeological interest attaching to it. A monument is not, as many people would think, necessarily a building, structure, castle, or statue, but anything which has historic and artistic interest, movable or immovable; and if my noble friend wishes that to be so, I think it would be wise to amend the definition so that it would include movable as well as immovable monuments.
<col>870</col>
I think the use of the words "and includes the site of any such monument" m the definition clause would lead the Court, in interpreting the Bill, to say that what was meant was fixed monuments. Suppose, for instance, the arms of Henry V which ho wore at Agincourt were deposited on his tomb; they would be movable, yet I think the nation would wish to preserve them if they were in danger almost as much, if not quite as much, as the tomb itself<lb/>
The whole subject is a difficult one, and I have no doubt will receive careful attention. I do not believe that this Bill, or some such Bill as this on moderate lines, could do any possible harm. I think the extreme cases that occur will be very few. But, on the other hand, I do think that giving to a responsible Minister of the Crown the position that this Bill would give would stimulate the interest of people in the various localities in our ancient historical monuments and thereby do considerable good. The Commission for which I speak has undoubtedly in the limited time in which it has been at work effected that very beneficial purpose. It has not been inquisitorial; it has been assisted in every possible way by the owners of property. I believe this Bill if passed would tend to assist the owners of these monuments rather than interfere in any way with their rights over their property. I do not for a moment say that this is a perfect Bill, but I hope that some satisfactory measure may emerge from the Joint Committee, and, if it does, and is carried out on moderate lines, it will be to the benefit of the country and the world at large.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01833"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I venture to agree in the main with the observations of the noble Lord who has just addressed us, and more particularly with his concluding remarks. For my own part I am glad to give support to this Bill, both because this is a matter in which I have taken great interest and because I think, on behalf of those noble Lords who sit on this side of the House, I can promise an interest and a sympathy equal to my own. I think the noble Lord who has just spoken was quite right in saying that this Bill would do no harm to anybody, subject to certain changes which may be introduced at a later stage, but that, on the contrary, it may do substantial service to owners in regard to the
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0461"/>
<col>871</col>
ancient monuments which they possess. Attaching the importance to the matter that I do, I was a little disappointed at the speech of the noble Earl in moving the Second Reading. This Bill may be regarded as a very subordinate matter in the general scheme of the legislation of the Government, but to those who take an interest in ancient monuments it is a very important measure indeed, and I came down to the House with the hope of hearing the noble Earl discourse upon it for a period of at least half an hour, and I should have been content even to listen to him for an hour. But he managed to compress his observations within seven minutes. He treated the Bill as if it were a perfunctory matter, and assumed that all responsibility had been discharged inasmuch as it was to be referred to a Joint Committee.<lb/>
I agree that to refer the Bill to a Joint Committee of both Houses is the best method of dealing with this matter, and I hope there will be constituted a Committee which will be thoroughly competent to discuss the various provisions of the Bill and, very likely, to make improvements in it. But I do not feel thereby dispensed from making a few observations on the subject. On the contrary I feel impelled by this procedure to do so, because, as I understand, when the Bill comes back from the Joint Committee, unless it be radically altered, we shall have no opportunity of again discussing it on Second Reading stage in this House; the Bill will come back to us at the Committee stage, and we shall then only be able to revise it point by point in questions of detail. Therefore I hope your Lordships will pardon me if at this stage, having gone deeply into the matter, I venture to make a few observations, not by way of impressing my own views upon your Lordships, but with the possibility, perhaps, of lending assistance to the Committee in the duty which will presently lie before them.<lb/>
May I say that with the principle of the Bill I am, and I am sure every one of your Lordships is, in hearty agreement. The whole attitude of this country and of the civilised world in general has changed towards arch&#x00E6;ology in recent years. We regard the national monuments to which this Bill refers as part of the heritage and history of the nation. They are part of the heritage of the nation, because every citizen feels an interest in them although
<col>872</col>
he may not own them; and they are part of the history of the nation, because they are documents just as valuable in reading the records of the past as is any manuscript or parchment deed to which you can refer. That point of view is recognised by the owners of these monuments, one of whom&#x2014;the noble Duke behind me&#x2014;has already spoken. I believe they do generally recognise that they stand with regard to these monuments not merely in the position of private owners of property, but that they are the owners of that which is, in a sense&#x2014;a broad sense, I admit&#x2014;a national possession, for which they are trustees to the nation at large. That is a principle we shall all accept.<lb/>
The case in England is different from what it is in any other country I know, and for this reason. These ancient monuments are dear, not only to ourselves, but to our offspring who have gone out from this country to our Dominions beyond the seas. They are a part also of their heritage and of their history and tradition, and the reason for this feeling is quite clear. In the countries to which they have gone there are no such ancient monuments. In the nature of things they cannot exist there owing to the newness of the country. The result is that year by year we see our kith and kin from America or from the Colonies come back to this country and visit, with an interest and a devotion greater even than our own, the ancient monuments which exist in this land. Therefore we have a duty in keeping them up which is not only a national duty but may be described as an Imperial duty.<lb/>
The last speaker raised the question of what a national monument is. I take it that the national monuments to which reference is made in this Bill are structural monuments which may be, on the one hand, old stone circles and remains, and on the other may be fabrics&#x2014;and by fabrics I mean castles, the castellated structures that recall to us the traditions of the feudal times; the mansion houses, or great homes inhabited in many cases by the nobility; the manor houses which reproduce so much of the traditions and life of bygone times; and then, descending the scale, the smaller buildings, whether they be bridges, market crosses, cottages, or even barns, which carry on their face the precious story of the past. I take it that that is
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0462"/>
<col>873</col>
what is meant by monuments in this Bill, and that there is no idea of applying the definition to the movable objects to which the noble Lord referred. I suppose it would be true to say that the number of the monuments to which I refer is greater in England than in almost any other country, greater because of our less troubled history, because of our relative freedom from invasion, because we have been less devastated than other countries by Civil war. All that is true enough. But, at the same time, you have only to study the records of this matter to see that the number is diminishing from year to year and almost from day to day. If you take up any book about the old monuments of Britain 100 or 150 years ago and compare them with the numbers that now exist, you will be horrified at the diminution. The same applies to almost every kind of monument to which I might refer. Take the stone circles. Go and look at Avebury, where you see that magnificent arrangement of stones quite destroyed, its form almost entirely lost by the depredations of men who have taken the stones to build cottages and walls, and even to supply material for roads. Everywhere, of course, a certain amount of destruction is brought about by the ravages of time, but even more has been wrought in this country by indifference, carelessness, vandalism, and the heedless utilitarianism of the day. Those are the sort of dangers we have to guard against, and as, owing to these causes, our ancient monuments diminish in number, so a higher value attaches to those which remain and a greater duty devolves upon us to preserve them.<lb/>
This is the fourth Bill relating to this subject which has been placed before Parliament. I am sorry not to see my noble friend Lord Avebury in the House, and still sorrier because I understand his absence is due to ill-health. No man has done more than Lord Avebury to preserve our ancient monuments, and he was the real parent of the Bill of 1882. It is almost incredible, if one looks back at the Parliamentary history of the time, to find how much opposition was excited by that mild and inoffensive measure. This is a country in which the idea of the rights of property has always been more sedulously cherished than in any other, but when you see that in order to get that Bill through Parliament it had to be denuded of many of its important features, and only after
<col>874</col>
many years was it passed in an almost innocuous form into law, one feels almost ashamed of the reputation of one's countrymen. The Bills to which I refer were very mild and insignificant measures, and I agree with Lord Burghclere that, if this Bill passes into law in its present form, twenty years hence it will be looked upon as a ridiculously mild and inoffensive Bill also.<lb/>
I do not say we ought to be guided by the practice or the precedent of foreign countries, but I do think it is worth while to remember that we are far behind in these respects any other civilised country, not only the greatest but even the smallest, in Europe. In other countries the laws are much more stringent. Foreign Governments take power to assume charge of buildings. They take entire control of excavations, and have almost in all cases powers of compulsory expropriation. Then, in addition to their legislation, they have a most powerful and perfect machinery. Staffs of inspectors and conservators are charged with duties in this respect. We have none of those things in this country. I am not saying that we ought to have them. The spirit of our life and of our legislation is opposed to this excessive and rather bureaucratic interference, and I should be the last to propose legislation like that to which the noble Duke referred, which exists in Italy, or still more in Greece, where any national monument on the property of a private person is treated as State property. He is not allowed to touch it in any way, and the State may become the possessor of it at any moment it chooses. I do not say we ought to go as far as that, but I do think we have rather gone to the other extreme. And one of the main reasons why I. welcome this legislation is that it seems to me an effort in the right direction, a recognition of responsibility, too long delayed, which the State ought certainly to assume.<lb/>
The question is, I will not say, Has a case been made out for this Bill?&#x2014;because the noble Earl spoke with such extreme brevity that he gave himself no time to make out a case&#x2014;but, Can a case be made out for this Bill? I think most undoubtedly it can. But let me add that in anything that falls from my lips on that point I would not like to be thought to utter one word in disparagement of the attitude and conduct of private owners in this country. I think that, broadly speaking, the owners of the
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0463"/>
<col>875</col>
famous structures to which I am referring have been actuated by the highest motives, and have fulfilled their charge in a spirit of patriotism and of public duty. Notably does this apply to the case of my noble friend behind me, the Duke of Rutland, whose upkeep of Haddon is not only a matter of honour to himself but a great source of delight to hundreds of thousands of his fellow creatures. The same applies to other famous monuments&#x2014;to Fountains Abbey, in Yorkshire, and to Melrose Abbey, both the property of members of your Lordships' House, and kept up in a manner free from all reproach. This is a recognition which I think anybody speaking on this matter ought freely and frankly to make. But the case for the Bill is not, of course, what is done by these noble owners of whom I am speaking or by owners in general, but what has been done in other cases and what might be done in cases which have not yet arisen.<lb/>
I have referred to Avebury and the shocking spoliation and demolition that have taken place there. Let me mention one or two other cases that I happen to know personally. There is the case of the famous standing stones of Laggangairn, which only three-quarters of a century ago were fifteen in number and are now only two. There is the case&#x2014;within the recollection of nearly every noble Lord seated in this Chamber&#x2014;of Temple Bar. There was that beautiful structure, reminiscent of a very interesting period in our history, torn down from the centre of one of the most prominent streets in London, parted with to a private individual, erected in a private park outside London, and replaced by a ghastly griffin which glares at us every time we go down to St. Paul's Cathedral. Then there is the case of Tattershall Castle in Lincolnshire. It may interest your Lordships to know that that castle, which is really a beautiful specimen of English brick-work of the fifteenth century&#x2014;I suppose the finest specimen in existence anywhere&#x2014;was sold to an American syndicate for purely speculative purposes. They might have done with it what they willed. The beautiful and historic mantelpieces, covered with the heraldic bearings of the former owners of Tattershall, were taken out with the object of being sent to America. Take another case. I suppose there is not one of us who does not look with reverential feelings upon Stonehenge. I believe the present owner of
<col>876</col>
Stonehenge is thoroughly alive to his responsibility. But under our existing law the owner might sell it to-morrow; he might pull it down to-morrow; he might part with it to an American syndicate to be erected in the Central Park in New York. I give that as a case of what might be done with our national possessions.<lb/>
In these cases the Government, in the existing condition of affairs, is absolutely helpless. All it can do is to sit still and look on while these acts may happen, the only power it possesses being the limited and almost futile prerogative given it by the legislation in 1882 and 1900. You may say, "Oh, but these things could not be done." My Lords, there is nothing but public opinion to prevent their being done. Public opinion, I venture to say, is a very insecure guarantee in matters of taste and antiquity and art. For in what way does public opinion act in the matter? It proceeds entirely by fits and starts. It flares up, probably as a result of a letter in the newspapers, and there is a great agitation which eventually dies away into utter and callous indifference. I venture to say you cannot rely on public opinion to act as the check and guarantee you require.<lb/>
I should like to say that this Bill in my view makes a most moderate claim upon the rights and privileges of owners of property. As I understand, a man is not under this Bill forbidden to own, to buy, to sell, or to restore any ancient monument with which he may be connected. The Government cannot force compulsory acquisition upon him. Nothing can be taken from him without his own consent. Moreover, it ought to be remembered that this Bill does not in any way touch dwelling-houses, so that there can be no invasion of the sanctity of a man's home, however ancient and venerable it may be. As long as a man treats the monument in his possession well and reverently, this Bill makes no interference with him at all. It is only at the point where he utilises his rights of ownership to neglect, or injure, or destroy, that the Bill comes in as a form of protection and a check. In other words, the good owner is not touched in the slightest degree by this Bill. It is only the vandal or negligent owner whom it would affect.<lb/>
I made a very careful study of the Bill before venturing to speak to your Lordships
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0464"/>
<col>877</col>
upon it, and I do not think, if I may say so, that the noble Earl in charge of the Bill has been altogether wise in the way in which he has drawn it up. If you look at this Bill, covering ten or eleven pages, you might imagine that it was a bold and serious innovation. It is nothing of the sort. The greater part of the Bill is merely consolidation; two-thirds or three-fourths of it are merely a repetition of Acts already on the Statute-book. If I had been in the noble Earl's place, I should have left these Acts alone and should have supplemented them by the new provisions he has introduced into this Bill, because in all these matters you have to be careful not to offend or frighten people, and there may be a certain number of people who will say, "Here is a great body of legislation which seems rather serious and rather wide," whereas the new powers taken in the Bill are really of the smallest and almost microscopic dimensions.<lb/>
As I understand, there are two new powers taken in this Bill, and two only. The first is the right of initiative on the part of the Government to assume control of any monument which may be neglected or in danger of destruction, and the second is the constitution of an Advisory Board to assist the Government in regard to this matter. Perhaps your Lordships will permit me before this matter goes to the Joint Committee to say one word about each of these two new powers. I will deal first with the right of initiative to be taken by the Government, which appears in Part III of the Bill. The noble Earl said, and I think said justly, that this right is safeguarded by adequate precautions. These precautions are detailed in Clause 6 of the Bill, and I will not weary your Lordships by recapitulating them. I will only say that I do not think that under them any injustice could be done to an owner. But there is one point that is not raised here. I do not myself conceive that the interest of an owner could be in any way injured by these provisions, nor do I think that the selling value of his property would be diminished by the existence upon it of a monument the custody of which had been assumed by the Government. But supposing he held an opposite view, and supposing he felt that compensation was due to him for this apparent diminution of his rights. In any case it could only be so small that it might be worth while to meet him on the point, and I suggest to the noble
<col>878</col>
Earl whether it is not worth considering the case for compensation, and providing that if such a case did arise it might be referred to the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, who are mentioned in Clause 7, subsection (3), of the Bill. I say I do not think the case would arise, because the only contention that the owner could make if he wished to sell his property would be that the selling value had diminished because he could not sell the ancient monument upon it, and this depreciation could only have a monetary value if he proposed to pull down the building&#x2014;the very object which the Bill is introduced in order to prevent. But I think it might be well if the noble Earl were to consider the point.<lb/>
Then I come to Clause 7, subsection (3)&#x2014;the right of pre-emption by the Commissioners of Works. This was the point to which the noble Duke behind me called attention. I am not at all convinced that it is necessary to take these powers, and I will tell the House why. Under the existing Acts the Commissioners of Works have already power to purchase by agreement with the owner. They have had this power since 1882. Have they purchased a single building? I think I am correct in saying that not one penny of public, money has been devoted to the purchase of existing monuments, although these powers have been in force for thirty years. The same would apply under this Bill. I doubt if the Treasury would ever find the money for the purpose. They have not done so hitherto, and would be less likely in the new circumstances to do so. I do not see why the owner should not be at liberty to sell if he pleases to anybody, subject only to the existence of the Preservation Order, which would prevent the monument on his property from being neglected or destroyed. I venture, therefore, respectfully to suggest that this right of preemption which you take for the Government is not really required, because it would be inoperative, that it may excite a certain amount of suspicion as to your intentions, and merely produce alarm where you want to carry with you general consent.<lb/>
I said that the other new power taken in the Bill was the creation of the Advisory Board. This is a very important feature. It is obviously of the first importance, because upon the composition and working of the board and the public confidence that it carries depends the success of your
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0465"/>
<col>879</col>
measure. The proposed composition of the board is given in the First Schedule, and just now the noble Earl in charge of the Bill said he thought of adding to the list of authorities there represented the County Councils Association. I only wish to make two observations on that list. The first is this. I do not feel quite clear why the Royal Academy of Arts is inserted. That is an academy for the furtherance of painting and sculpture, and I am not aware that its members have any special knowledge of ancient monuments.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01834"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: architecture.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01835"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: Oh, that is where you bring in the Academy of Arts. But there is another society which I think might very well be represented&#x2014;I refer to the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, which has existed for this particular purpose for nearly forty years, and has done excellent work, and might surely claim to have a representative upon the Advisory Board. My next point is this. How is your Advisory Board going to deal with Scotland? The Bill does not apply to Ireland, so I do not raise that. There are to be only two Scottish members on the Board, who would probably find a difficulty in attending meetings in England, while the English members would similarly find it difficult to go to Scotland to attend a meeting. I ask whether it would not be better to have a board composed of Scottish members sitting in Scotland who would not replace the English Board or enjoy any independent powers, but who could inquire and report to the Board in London upon that part of the subject which related to their own country. I think in practice that might be found more suitable and practicable than the arrangement suggested in the Bill.<lb/>
One more question as to the Advisory Board. How are they to be set in motion? Nothing is said about that in the Bill. I take it that what will really happen will be that the Inspector of Ancient Monuments will make a representation to the Advisory Board and get them to report on any particular matter. But it must be remembered that there is only one Inspector of Ancient Monuments at present. Years ago the office used to be filled, and ably filled, by General Pitt-Rivers, but since he died in 1900 there has been no appointment until, I think, last year. Now you
<col>880</col>
have a very competent Inspector of Ancient Monuments in Mr. Peers. But there is only one, and if the Advisory Board with their great powers are to be set in motion by this one gentleman only, he will have his work cut out if he is to cover the whole country. I hope that as time goes on it will be found possible to have more than one Inspector of Ancient Monuments.<lb/>
One observation as to the County Councils. The county councils were first brought into connection with monuments by the Act of 1900, which gave them powers, recapitulated in this Bill, to purchase by agreement, and to take charge of monuments. Here, again, my impression is that those powers have been an absolute dead letter. I do not think the county councils have purchased a single monument. And why? The reason is quite obvious&#x2014;because the only funds which they could devote to the purpose are the funds provided for them by the ratepayers, and I should be surprised to find any county council in this country with the fear of the ratepayers behind it proposing to devote their money to this object. Therefore really this is a <i>brutum fulmen</i>, and unless the Government is prepared to make a grant to the county councils for the purpose, which sounds a good idea but would hardly appeal to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, it is useless to put in your Bill a provision that the county councils may purchase, because as a matter of fact they will do nothing of the kind. I do not mean, therefore, to say that the principle of bringing in the county councils is not a right one. I think it is a right one, because you want to stimulate in localities a pride and interest in the beautiful things that exist there. You want local co-operation with the Government, but you do not get that by giving to the county councils powers which they cannot possibly exercise. What I suggest to the noble Earl is this, that he might consider the desirability of inviting the county councils to appoint one of their number, some historical student or some lover of the arts&#x2014;and these are to be found in most localities&#x2014;who might be a link of communication between the county councils and the Advisory Board. I truly believe you would interest them more in the work and produce more satisfactory results by that method than by giving them powers of purchase which they cannot possibly exercise.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0466"/>
<col>881</col>
There is only one other point to which I desire to refer, and that is a point of omission in the Bill. I make no complaint of the omission; I only call attention to it because it is a matter upon which the Government may either wish to make an explanation, or which conceivably they may be willing to refer to the Joint Committee. It is this. I spoke a little earlier in my remarks about the nature of our national monuments in this country, but I suppose we shall all agree that outside of castles and mansions and manor houses, and so on, the most splendid national monuments that we possess are our ancient cathedrals and cur parish churches. They are not only the pride of the country, they are not only part of the visible history of the country, but they appeal in a peculiar degree to the reverence and the sentiment of every Englishman. Now what is the case as regards our cathedrals and our churches? Of course the situation here is wholly different from what it is abroad, and notably different from what it is in France. There, as we know, the bulk of the ecclesiastical property has been secularised. The fabrics of the cathedrals and the churches belong in most cases to the State, and if you look in the French Budget you will find a large sum set down for the upkeep of these religious fabrics. In this country we have exactly the opposite system. The State, except in cases where, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners are concerned, has no responsibility whatever for these fabrics. They are the property either of corporations or bodies or individuals, or a combination of the three. That is all in keeping with our general scheme of life and government, and I do not say that on the whole it is not a much better system than the Continental system; I think it is. But it is not unattended with danger.<lb/>
Let me tell you the sort of danger which does arise from it in practice. Take the case of Westminster Abbey over the way&#x2014;the most historic, the most famous, the most passionately revered building in the whole British Empire. As I understand, the Dean and Chapter of Westminster Abbey have such complete control over the fabric that it would be in their power to take down, alter, remove, or destroy any monument in that building without reference to anybody. I believe they could introduce into Westminster Abbey any structural or decorative alteration
<col>882</col>
they pleased. They may put up&#x2014;they do put up&#x2014;any class of stained glass window they like, whether or not it is in harmony with its surroundings. Take another case. I believe that the bulk of our parish churches are in the hands of the vicar and churchwardens, and for all I know it might be in the power of the vicar and church-wardens of Stratford-on-Avon church to take down the monument of Shakespeare.</membercontribution></p>

I am not suggesting to the noble Earl that he should bring cathedrals and churches under this Bill, but if he is going to set up this Advisory Board, composed of very competent persons with consultative powers with regard to monuments in general, might it not be a good thing to establish some link of connection between the authorities responsible for our cathedrals and churches and the Advisory Board? Might it not be desirable that they should take advantage of the authority and advice of the Advisory Board, and that in this way some sort of control should be exercised over those splendid fabrics which are so much a part of our national and religious life I These are matters very dear to my heart, and if I had not taken this opportunity of putting them before your Lordships they could not have come before the Committee, and it is conceivable that in some cases they may be worthy of consideration.<lb/>
I think it is quite possible to make out of this Bill a very good Bill. My only regret is that it does not go rather further. I have had experience of this sort of legislation myself, because when I was in
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0467"/>
<col>883</col>
India I introduced a Bill for the protection of ancient monuments which was carried into law in 1904. That Bill was largely based on your legislation in this country, and I dare say that in composing this Bill His Majesty's Government may have done us the honour of referring to our Indian Act. When that Bill was introduced in India there were all sorts of protests made about interference with property, possible injustice, and so on. Wherever we could we acted upon the principle of the co-operation of the owner with the Government, and only in the case of the owner conspicuously failing to perform his duty did we take power for the Government to interfere. The Act has been in operation for eight years. During that time, even in a country so extraordinarily sensitive as India about anything connected with religious buildings, there has not been one murmur of opposition, no case of injustice, nothing but satisfaction at the operation of the Act. I hope I may draw from that a good omen for this Bill, and I trust that when it comes back from the Joint Committee it will be in a form which will secure for it the unanimous approval of this House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01840"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD EVERSLEY</member><membercontribution>: I dare say your Lordships have observed that I have introduced a Bill on the same subject as that now before the House which stands for Second Reading on Thursday next. That Bill was originally introduced in the other House at the instance of that well-known society the National Trust for the Preservation of Historic Monuments, but my noble friend Lord Beauchamp expressly wished that the Bill should be introduced in this House also, in order that it might be referred to the same Joint Committee as his Bill and the Bill introduced by my noble friend Lord Southwark. Accordingly I have introduced the Bill with that object. It is in no way antagonistic to the Government's Bill, and in fact might be added to it without any detriment to that measure. The main object of the Bill is to prevent the recurrence of events like those which might have occurred in the case of Tattershall Castle, and which were only prevented by the generous intervention of the noble Earl who has just spoken.<lb/>
The noble Earl correctly stated the present law with regard to monuments.
<col>884</col>
He said that the law of this country is more unfavourable to the public in respect of ancient monuments than the law of almost any other country in Europe, and he pointed out that it was quite possible for the owner of an ancient monument or ancient castle or abbey to remove the monument altogether, and to sell it to an American millionaire for shipment across the Atlantic. When thirty years ago I was responsible for dealing with this subject and carried the first Ancient Monuments Act, practically the only danger which then existed to ancient monuments was the possibility of their neglect by the owners, a neglect due mainly to ignorance on the part of the owners of the value of them. But of late years a new danger has grown up, and that is the demand on the part of American millionaires to purchase these monuments and ship them across the Atlantic. That may possibly seem to many people a rather remote danger, but it has been threatened in more than one case.<lb/>
I recollect not many years ago, in the case of Stonehenge, that the owner of that most remarkable monument sent an emissary to the Government offering to sell the monument, together with some few hundred acres of down land, for&#x00A3;125,000, and when the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, Viscount St. Aldwyn, refused to give any such exorbitant price the emissary said that in that case the owner would sell the monument to an American millionaire who would ship it across the Atlantic. The noble Viscount replied, with very proper spirit, that if any such thing were attempted the Government would send a military force to prevent it. I think that is the tone and temper in which this subject of ancient monuments and their possible removal across the Atlantic ought to be approached. For my part, I think that the possibility of monuments of this kind being treated in this way might be dealt with in a somewhat stronger and firmer spirit than it is in the Bill now before us. I cannot myself recognise that the right of property of an ancient monument of this kind carries with it the right of destruction or of sale for exportation. I listened carefully to the speech of the noble Earl, Lord Curzon, and I understood from him&#x2014;he will correct me if I am wrong&#x2014;that he did not consider that the owner of an ancient monument had the right to remove it and export it.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0468"/>
<col>885</col>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01841"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: I quite agree with the noble Lord as regards exportation. But I would not interfere with the right of a man to sell his property to another, subject to the condition which this Bill provides that the monument is properly looked after.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01842"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD EVERSLEY</member><membercontribution>: Then I have rightly interpreted the noble Earl. I do not think it ought to be permitted to the owner of such a monument to sell it for the purpose of its removal from the country, and I feel that that proposition should be boldly stated in the Bill. If it were, it would very much facilitate the passing of the Bill and at all events remove what is a considerable existing danger. I had some little difficulty in understanding the proposal of my noble friend Lord Beauchamp on this point. So far as I understand his Bill, he proposes to give a right of pre-emption to the Government. Where there is a danger of a monument being dealt with in this way the Government Department will have the right of getting a Provisional Order under which a right of pre-emption will be obtained, and then the Inland Revenue authorities are to come in for the purpose of determining the value of the property. They are directed to take into account the selling value of the monument. Well, what is the selling value of the property under these conditions? Is it to be based on the assumption that the owner is at liberty to sell it to an American millionaire for exportation? or is it to be the value which, perhaps, the owner has assigned to it under Mr. Lloyd George's Finance Act? because there would be a considerable difference between the two.<lb/>
Let me take the case of Stonehenge. The probability is that if its value is to be based on the value assigned to the monument under the Finance Act it would be an exceedingly small one&#x2014;not more than a few hundred pounds; but if it is to be based on the value which the owner might obtain from an American millionaire it might be a very large one. It seems to me that the basis of value which the Inland Revenue are to lay down ought to be more clearly defined. At all events, I only think it necessary for the moment to say that I am not altogether satisfied with that clause in my noble friend's Bill. I cannot help thinking that he would do wisely to deal with this matter rather more
<col>886</col>
fearlessly and strongly, and I would suggest&#x2014;the proposition is contained in the Bill which I have laid before the House&#x2014;that the removal and exportation of monuments of this kind ought to be strictly prohibited, leaving, of course, to the owner any other rights of property which he has, and the power of selling the monument, if he thinks At, to any other person subject to the conditions to which I have adverted. I understand the House to desire that the Government's Bill and the other two Bills on this subject should be referred to a Joint Committee, when these questions will undoubtedly be thrashed out, and I have no doubt that the noble Earl who has just spoken will be one of the members of the Committee and will give his valuable advice on the subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01843"><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not propose, where there is such agreement on this subject, to hammer at an open door, but I wish to ask the noble Earl in charge of this Bill one or two questions the replies to which might, I think, be useful when the Bill is considered by the Joint Committee. As I read the Bill, the only protection given is for monuments which have been the work of men's hands at some time or another. But there are natural objects in this country, such as the Giant's Causeway, which are quite as well worthy of preservation, and I think the Committee might very well consider whether there are not important natural objects of interest which do not come within the definition at present in the Bill. The definition as it stands includes any "structure or erection." Would the White Horse of Berkshire be called either a structure or an erection? It is an excavation on a hillside. I think the definition should be made sufficiently wide to clearly embrace such an object.<lb/>
The noble Earl opposite referred to Part III, which provides for the protection of ancient monuments even against the owner. But the words in Part III are different from the general words. There the monument is to be under the protection of the Commissioners, but not under the guardianship of the Commissioners. In Clause 14 there is, in the case of a monument placed under the guardianship of the Commissioners, a provision about injuring or defacing the monument. No doubt there was a special object in the use of the word "protection." In Clause 24 there is
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0469"/>
<col>887</col>
a subsection that His Majesty may, by Order in Council, declare that this clause shall apply to any monument specified in the Order which is an ancient monument within the meaning of the Act, but that provision and Part III do not put the monument under the guardianship of the Commissioners, and as I read subsection (3) of Clause 14 the owner is the one person exempt from any restraint if he disfigures the monument. The owner is only subject to restraint if he has constituted either the Government or the county council guardians of the monument. This may seem a small point, but I think it is one worth considering. I think we would all agree that the owner ought, as much as any other person, to be prevented from defacing anything which is considered worthy of preservation. I think that if any ancient earthwork was thought worthy of preservation it ought to be capable of being protected even against the owner.<lb/>
I may say that I am in great sympathy with this Bill. The first Act which Lord Avebury got through Parliament was nothing more than a pious expression of a wish that these monuments should be preserved, but it was a sort of intimation of a Parliamentary disposition which grew slowly and was followed by enactments which were a little stronger, and which we hope in twenty years will be stronger still. There is one point in this Bill to which I wish to call attention. The Bill proposes, where a monument is put under the guardianship of a public authority, that the public authority may give a right of access to the monument. At present when an owner puts any ancient monument under guardianship the only extent to which he divests himself of any right of property is as to meddling with the monument or destroying it, but he preserves his right of not throwing it open to the public. I think that in most cases an owner would wish that the public should have a right of access, but I imagine that there are cases in which he would not desire that there should be an unlimited night of access. Take the case of Muckross Abbey at Killarney. I can quite understand that the owner might put the Abbey under guardianship and not be aware at the time that he was creating a power in another body to give a right of access. Then take Fountains Abbey. Lord Ripon kindly allowed the public to go in&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01844"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I would call the noble Lord's attention to Clause 13, which provides that where the Commissioners of Works or the county council are the guardians only, the public shall have access "with the consent of the owner of the monument."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01845"><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: I apologise to the noble Earl. I did not put the comma in the right place. I am sure we are all in sympathy with this Bill, and many of us would be glad, when public opinion ripens, to go further in the direction indicated. But in this case I am rather conservative. I do not want to hurry beyond public opinion, and if we carry public opinion with us we shall do much more than if we asked for further legislation at present at the risk of alarming those who own these monuments.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01846"><member>LORD BARNARD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl stated, in moving the Second Reading of this Bill, that representation had been made to him by the County Councils Association desiring that they should in some way be represented on the body which is to be constituted under the Bill. May I suggest to my noble friend that he should also consider the case of the analogous body which deals with the affairs of municipal corporations, and also consider the case of those authorities and their powers and duties with regard to ancient monuments as well as those prescribed in the Bill for county councils. I am associated with a municipal borough, the borough of Shrewsbury, which is one of the most beautiful old towns in England, and a year ago we were faced with a great difficulty because we were threatened with the loss of a beautiful mediaeval timber house. In my opinion there are in municipal boroughs an enormous number of ancient monuments which are as well worth preservation and quite as much in need of being looked after as the other class of monuments which are indicated in the Bill and have been referred to in the course of the debate. The borough of Shrewsbury and other boroughs realise that these ancient monuments are a great asset, and they would welcome any legislation which gave them additional powers of control and additional opportunities of preserving them.</membercontribution></p>

<col>889</col>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01847"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY or STATE FOR INDIA (THE MARQUESS OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl opposite made some slight and quite friendly complaint against my noble friend behind me that he had treated this subject with undue brevity in moving the Second Reading. I unfortunately was detained and did not hear my noble friend speak, but I have no doubt he concluded that all that was required of him at this stage was to lay the matter generally before the House with the view of the different Bills going to a Joint Committee, and that at some later period he would have a chance of commenting upon any particular proposals.<lb/>
The noble Earl opposite, whose interest in these matters is well known, went into the subject at considerably more length and made a valuable contribution to the debate, all the more welcome to us because he was good enough practically to adopt our measure as his own, for not merely did he promise us his support but he even went so far, which is an unusual experience for us, as to hint some regrets that the measure did not go far enough in the direction of compulsion. It is quite true that in this country, with our national habits and traditions, it is not easy to strike the exact mean between the claims of private ownership and the claims of the public in relation to such a matter as ancient monuments. The noble Earl pointed out that in some countries abroad the interference of Government is infinitely greater, the regulations are far more stringent, and the rights of private owners are more continuously interfered with. That no doubt is so, at any rate as regards some countries, and there is, of course, a distinct reason for it. It is hardly too much to say that in some cases the affairs of those countries are carried on in the way they are carried on largely owing to the immense number of strangers who visit them and the money which they bring and leave behind.<lb/>
Noble Lords will no doubt remember that in the particular case of Italy, which was one that the noble Earl mentioned, it is considered that Italy is able to pay interest in gold on that part of its National Debt which is held abroad, and further to pay in gold, or in the equivalent to gold, the difference due from it owing to the excess of its imports over exports, entirely
<col>890</col>
owing to the fact that the tourists who travel in Italy spend a sum which is estimated at over&#x00A3;20,000,000 a year. It is very natural that those countries should do everything to attract and keep the traveller who, in almost literal sense, lays the golden eggs, and that therefore any interference with ancient monuments becomes almost a national disaster. Here we are glad to see visitors from abroad, but we are not affected in the same way, and as a country I do not know that we very much care, from the point of view of our pockets, whether they come or not. That, no doubt, is the reason, or at any rate one reason, for the comparative indifference which has been shown in the past to the care and preservation of our ancient monuments.<lb/>
Perhaps at this point I might allude to one matter which was mentioned by my noble friend Lord Sheffield, who asked my noble friend in charge of the Bill whether it would not be possible to extend its scope&#x2014;and it would be a very marked extension&#x2014;by including in it objects of natural beauty. He mentioned the Giant's Causeway as an instance. We have deliberately left out of this particular measure such natural objects because we think it desirable to do one thing at a time. I might remind your Lordships that to attempt to include all natural features&#x2014;to give but one instance, your Lordships will remember the excitement which was caused by quarrying in the cliffs at Clifton near Bristol, and there have been many other cases of the same kind&#x2014;to attempt to include in a measure of this sort all natural features of public interest and of beauty might, I fear, tend unduly to overweight the Bill; but I have no doubt that if, when they consider the whole question, the Joint Committee are of opinion that it is desirable or possible to include at any rate some objects of interest which are not the work of man, they will take evidence on the point.<lb/>
On the question of the claims of private owners, I think it is clear that the main difficulty in this country must always be in relation to dwelling-houses. The Bill does not attempt to touch dwelling-houses as such, and I dare say there will be those who consider that that is an unfortunate omission. For instance, I think it cannot be disputed that, under the Bill, if the then owner of Tattershall Castle had chosen to
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0471"/>
<col>891</col>
fit up a bedroom in that beautiful old building&#x2014;with the aspect of which, as it happens, I have been familiar from my early youth&#x2014;and occasionally visited it, he could have sold out the mantelpieces to go to America or anywhere else, or have sold the building piecemeal in the horrifying manner described by the noble Earl without any interference from anybody. I have no doubt that the question of dwelling-houses is one which will invite no little discussion, but I am prepared to say that I think the Bill goes as far in that direction as public opinion would reasonably countenance. The interference with a man's home which might, and very possibly would, take place if the Bill were made stronger in this respect would, I think, not merely be unfair in itself, but might tend to create a certain prejudice against the whole principle of the Bill as it stands.<lb/>
As to the right of pre-emption, the noble Earl asked how it was that this right was included in the Bill. He regarded it in the form in which it appears&#x2014;it is in Clause 7, subsection (3)&#x2014;as a valueless power in itself, because the Preservation Order having been made, the work <i>ex hypothesi</i> could not be maltreated or neglected, and therefore it was hard to prevent the owner from selling. I think the answer to that is that there might be certain cases&#x2014;I return again to Tattershall Castle as a possible case&#x2014;where it would be advantageous to be able to make a purchase of a building of that kind rather than have to go through the elaborate and continuous process of watching which might be necessary to safeguard it, it being borne in mind that the owner, also <i>ex hypothesi,</i> would endeavour to evade that care and inspection in every possible way. And it must be remembered that it is not until a monument has been reported as being in danger of destruction or damage from neglect that such an Order can be made at all, and it is not until that Order is made that the right of pre-emption exists. I think it will be found on examination that there are cases in which that right of preemption might be both convenient and useful.<lb/>
Then the noble Earl made, if he will allow me to say so, some most interesting observations on the subject of ecclesiastical property. There, again, there has been a quite deliberate abstention on the part of
<col>892</col>
His Majesty's Government in this Bill from attempting to deal with ecclesiastical property. I quite agree with the noble Earl that there are cases in which one laments that there is not some authority, public or other, which is in a position to prevent the defacing, and even in some cases the destruction, of ancient ecclesiastical monuments. One is tempted to go further and apply the same wish to objects which would not be the subject of a measure such as this at all. One has heard of cases where old church plate of the highest interest from its antiquity, which also, of course, enormously adds to its value, because, as the noble Earl knows, there is no plate except ecclesiastical plate in England older than the fifteenth century and very little as old as that, whereas there is a certain proportion of ecclesiastical plate which is considerably older&#x2014;one has heard of cases in which parochial authorities have sold for large sums, very possibly to go abroad, old church plate with which they should not have been permitted to part. That, however, is by the way, because it is not one of the questions which come under this Bill. We have deliberately, as I say, refrained from raising the difficult and delicate questions arising out of the care of ecclesiastical buildings.<lb/>
The noble Earl, I think, expressed the hope that the Advisory Board which this Bill will bring into being might in some way or other be utilised for the purpose of giving advice, and even doing a little more perhaps than giving advice, in relation to ecclesiastical property. There is, however, this difficulty in this connection. The Advisory Board in giving its advice will either have to regard that advice as a mere contribution which may be taken advantage of or not, or some means must be devised of ensuring that that advice when given is followed, in which case it becomes hardly distinguishable from control. In the first case it will, I think, be difficult to subject so important and carefully selected a body to the rather invidious position of merely giving advice which might or might not be taken and which might possibly be neglected altogether; and in the other case the advice being bound to be taken, you run up against the difficulty, which we all admit in connection with ecclesiastical buildings, that you have to change the power of control from those ecclesiastical authorities with whom it rests already.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0472"/>
<col>893</col>
I think the only other point winch I need mention is that which was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Barnard. He asked why the same powers and duties which are given to county councils should not be also conferred upon municipal corporations, and he put forward that suggestion for the use and benefit of the Joint Committee. I can only say, on behalf of my noble friend behind me, that that is a suggestion which the Committee will certainly consider, and I hope myself that they will consider it favourably. One or two other questions were raised by my noble friend Lord Sheffield, but they are matters with which the Joint Committee will be able to deal. In conclusion, I need only thank the House and express our gratification at the reception which this measure has met with. My noble friend seems, though I did not hear him, to have spoken almost too humbly of its scope and purpose in moving the Second Reading, being desirous, I have no doubt, not to frighten your Lordships into the belief that a large measure was impending dealing with property rights. The measure in one sense is no doubt not a large one, and I hope that the noble Earl opposite is mistaken in thinking that people will be terrified by the size of the Bill and by the presence of the consolidating clauses into believing that it is a smashing measure which is going to destroy a number of personal rights. It does not pretend or profess to be a very far-reaching measure, but we believe that it contains elements of real value, and we hope that the deliberations of the Joint Committee will lead to its being put into a form which will be to the general advantage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01848"><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should not have intervened in this debate but for the fact that from both Front Benches reference has been made to ecclesiastical property and the possible misuse of and injury to ancient monuments. I should be exceedingly sorry if, from the words which have fallen from noble Lords to-night, it were supposed that at this moment ecclesiastical property, whether fixed or movable, is under the unrestrained and unfettered control of the local custodians. It is not so, and it would be very unfortunate if I were taken by my silence as acquiescing in such a view. I would be the last to deny that on occasions in the past ecclesiastical property has not been protected as it ought to have been, but the utmost
<col>894</col>
care is taken now to prevent a repetition of anything of the kind. I am sure that those of your Lordships who are familiar with the working of ecclesiastical matters know how constant is the tutelage exercised over property of every kind against impecunious churchwardens or other people desiring to raise money, or, what is even a greater danger, against ecclesiastical restorers. The noble Marquess spoke of church plate as though that was in a more disposable condition than stained-glass windows. I would point out that that is not so, and that the smallest article of plate could not legally be parted with without a faculty obtained from the Diocesan Court. I only rose to prevent the impression going out that there was on the part of clergy and churchwardens power to dispose freely of such things, or that diocesan control was not being exercised carefully and actively in these matters.</membercontribution></p>

<title>BANKRUPTCY BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01880" align="center">[SECOND READING]</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01881">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01882"><member>THE EARL OF GRANARD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this Bill, to which I ask your Lordships to give a Second Reading, is identical, save for a few drafting amendments, with that which I had the honour of introducing last December. It is founded upon the Report of a Departmental Committee appointed in 1906 mainly in consequence of repeated representations from Chambers of Commerce and others to the effect that bankruptcy offences too often went without punishment. A further subject that had been pressed upon the attention of the Board of Trade was the ease with which fraud might be practised under deeds of arrangement. These questions and. certain others suggested by the Law Society and by Departmental experience were specifically commended to the attention of the Committee, who were also asked to report generally upon any matters of bankruptcy law and procedure as to which amendment might appear desirable.<lb/>
The Committee was a strong and representative one. The Chairman&#x2014;Mr. Montague Muir Mackenzie, now Referee
<col>900</col>
in the Supreme Court&#x2014;had had long experience in bankruptcy practice, and had for many years been standing counsel to the Board of Trade on bankruptcy questions. He was assisted by two Members of Parliament (of whom one represented trade, while the other is the present President of the Probate Division), and by representatives of the Law Society, the Trade Protection Societies, the Associated Chambers of Commerce, the Chartered Institute of Accountants, and commercial travellers, while official experience was represented in the person of the late Inspector-General in Bankruptcy. The Committee, after a long and careful inquiry, made their Report, which was a unanimous one, in April, 1908. I should like to say that the Board of Trade feel very greatly indebted to the Committee, and especially to the Chairman, for the painstaking energy and the thoroughness and ability with which they conducted their investigations, and for the admirable Report which they produced. The Committee's report was received with strong approval by representative commercial bodies, who by repeated resolutions and by deputation to the Board of Trade have asked for legislation on the lines recommended.<lb/>
As the result of their inquiry the Departmental Committee approved generally the present system of bankruptcy administration brought into existence by Mr. Chamberlain's Act of 1883, and in particular they found that the important subject of investigation into a bankrupt's conduct arid the causes of his insolvency is already adequately provided for. They made, however, numerous recommendations for amendment in matters of detail, the chief of which it may be convenient to describe, at the same time explaining such modifications as have been made in certain cases in preparing clauses based upon them.<lb/>
First, as to criminal offences. Under the present law a bankrupt charged with criminal offences is, after an order for his prosecution has been obtained from the Bankruptcy Court, brought before a magistrate, and, if the charge is not dismissed, he is committed for trial before Quarter Sessions, Assizes, or the Central Criminal Court, as the case may be. The proceedings must be undertaken by the Public Prosecutor. Under this cumbrous procedure there are some forty indictments
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0476"/>
<col>901</col>
annually. The Committee recommended that bankruptcy offences should be made capable of being dealt with by Courts of Summary jurisdiction. They further thought that in such cases as could be so disposed of the prosecution might be left in the hands of the Board of Trade or their officers, the Official Receivers. They were also of opinion that certain offences such as at present are only punishable by refusing or delaying the grant of discharge in bankruptcy should be made criminal. These were&#x2014;(1) the failure on the part of a trader to keep books of account, a fruitful source of bankruptcy and an easy means in many cases of escaping conviction for offences under the Debtors Act; (2) gambling&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01883"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: What is gambling?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01884"><member>THE EARL OF GRANARD</member><membercontribution>: That is difficult to construe. Everybody has a different opinion about that. The gambling here referred to is gambling and rash and hazardous speculation outside the scope of the bankrupt's own trade or business where these have brought about or materially contributed to bankruptcy. These two offences appeared to the Committee fit subjects for criminal punishment. With regard to the offence involved in not keeping hooks, although the recommendations of the Committee do not go beyond what is at present the law in France, in Germany, and. in Scotland, it has been thought that the time is perhaps not yet ripe for fully adopting the Committee's recommendations. The offence in question is therefore, as the present Bill runs, to arise only where the delinquent has been insolvent on a previous occasion. As to these new offences the Bill, adopting the recommendations of the Committee, makes them criminal only in the case of bankrupts engaged in trade or business. In such cases, where credit is practically indispensable under modern conditions, it will be admitted that the offences in question are specially grave and serious. There is, further, a period of two years' grace from the commencement of the Act; and, again, prosecutions for these offences are not to be undertaken except upon an Order of the Bankruptcy Court, which will have full knowledge of all the circumstances of the bankruptcy.<lb/>
The Committee had before them the question of trading on the part of un-
<col>902</col>
discharged bankrupts, whether in their own or in an assumed name. At present, if such a person obtains credit to the extent of&#x00A3;20 without disclosing that he is an undischarged bankrupt, he is guilty of an offence punishable with imprisonment up to twelve months. The Committee recommended that the limit should, be reduced to&#x00A3;10, and this is embodied in the Bill. I may mention that the same recommendation so far as relates to Scotland has recently been made by a Committee which has been inquiring into the bankruptcy law of that country. The Committee also recommended that it should be a criminal offence for a bankrupt to trade under an assumed name without disclosure of his true name and position to those with whom he deals. It has teen thought enough to require disclosure of the true name only.<lb/>
A further question to which both the legal and mercantile community attach great importance is that of after-acquired property. At present, so long as a bankrupt remains undischarged, all such property vests in the trustee in his bankruptcy, and it may happen that when an undischarged bankrupt after again trading finds himself once more insolvent and is adjudicated bankrupt a second time, his creditors find all his assets claimed by the trustee in the prior bankruptcy for the benefit of the prior creditors. There is, however, under decisions of the Courts, this restriction on the trustee's claim&#x2014;that where such after-acquired property has been sold by the bankrupt, a purchaser for value, even if he has knowledge of the bankruptcy, has a good title in the case of personal property, though not in the case of real estate. The Committee recommended that both classes of property should be put on the same footing, and this is proposed in the Bill. But in both cases it seems necessary, to avoid, collusive transactions, to confine the protection to innocent purchasers&#x2014;<i>i.e</i>., those without knowledge of the bankruptcy&#x2014;save in the case of transactions in the course of the bankrupt's trade or business, which it is proposed to protect even though the purchaser has knowledge of the bankruptcy. With regard to the claims of creditors to whom the bankrupt has incurred debts since his bankruptcy, the Committee recommended that these should be paid out of after-acquired property in priority to outstanding claims for debts provable in the bankruptcy. This appears to the Board of Trade to go
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0477"/>
<col>903</col>
too far, and it is thought that on the whole the course which will, on balance of considerations, be the most equitable is that the subsequent creditors' claims should be admitted on equal terms with the unsatisfied claims of the prior creditors.<lb/>
Again, much hardship has been occasioned to creditors by the restrictions which at present operate to prevent a married woman being made a bankrupt. The Committee recommended, and the Bill provides, that married women who trade, whether with or apart from their husbands, shall in future be subject to the Bankruptcy Laws. The Committee also had before them the question of contracts in marriage settlements for the future payment of money or transfer of property. Under the present law trade creditors may be seriously injured if such property is transferred on the eve of bankruptcy, while if the contract is for the payment of a sum of money (which may be quite unreasonably large) then, even if the contract has not been executed before bankruptcy, the trustees under the settlement, or the wife, can by their voting power control the bankruptcy proceeding in the bankrupt's interest and take a large part of the estate in dividend, really for his benefit. The Committee recommended an amendment to meet this evil, to which substantial effect is given by Clause 13 of the Bill. The Committee, however, proposed to make the execution of such contracts within a period of five years open to attack by the trustee in bankruptcy, but the Board of Trade have thought this perhaps undesirably long, and the Bill shortens the period to two years.<lb/>
A good deal of evidence was laid before the Committee as to evils arising from assignments of book-debts. Where such assignments are made trade creditors may see assets disappear on which they may reasonably have counted as part of the debtor's estate. The Committee came to the conclusion that, so far as relates to specific debts or debts growing due under specified contracts, there was no sufficient ground for legislative interference, but they recommended that general assignments of debts, existing or future, should be void against a trustee in bankruptcy, unless registered like bills of sale. The Bill adopts their recommendation.<lb/>
Another subject considered by the Committee was that of deeds of arrange-
<col>904</col>
meat (outside bankruptcy procedure). There is abundant evidence of mischief o and of positive fraud committed under such deeds, and the Committee recommended numerous safeguards, which are included in the Bill, to secure honest administration. It is not desirable, as your Lordships will readily understand, that these arrangements, which may in many cases be advantageous to creditors, should be subject to official control, but it is desirable that the creditors concerned should all be made aware of proposals for such deeds before they become effective. The Bill accordingly provides, as recommended by the Committee, that the express assent of a majority of the creditors must be obtained within the prescribed time. Provision is also made for the giving of security by the trustee; for the periodical rendering of accounts; and for the official audit thereof if asked for by creditors representing one-half in number and value of the total number of creditors affected by the deed.<lb/>
As to minor matters dealt with by proposals in the Bill which do not find place among the Committee's recommendations but were suggested by the experience of the Department, it may be enough to refer to Clauses 8 and 9, designed to cure a defect in the law which has been pressed upon the attention of the Board of Trade&#x2014;namely, the facilities that exist for a foreign member of a firm doing business in this country to withdraw his assets from English creditors; and Clause 21, relating to the claims of money lenders. At present such claims, so far as they include interest in excess of five per cent., are postponed to other claims in the bankruptcy; but by various devices, such as a series of transactions in which new promissory notes are successively substituted for the original notes, this provision is largely evaded. The amendments now proposed are meant to meet such evasion. I think I have now touched briefly on the different points raised in this Bill. The Government are anxious that the Bill should receive discussion in your Lordships' House, where there are so many experts on this particular subject of bankruptcy law, and it is therefore with confidence that I submit the Bill to your Lordships' consideration.</membercontribution></p>

<col>905</col>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01886"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD FABER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I welcome this Bill. I think it is a good Bill, and one that is desired by the commercial community. It has been very fully touched upon by the noble Earl who moved the Second Reading, and therefore it will not be necessary for me to detain your Lordships for more than a few minutes. The first clause gives Courts of Summary Jurisdiction power to dispose of bankruptcy offences when they are of only small amount. That is very necessary, because at present these small cases clog the wheels of the law and the larger cases are postponed when there is no sufficient reason for that postponement. The next important amendment of the law contained in this Bill has reference to commercial offences which are not now criminal. If a trader who has failed once omits to keep trading accounts it becomes a criminal offence on the second occasion. Personally, I think that where a trader who is trading with other people's money gets into difficulties and it is found that he has not kept any accounts at all, it ought to be made a criminal offence on the first occasion. I see that the Departmental Committee on Bankruptcy Law were in favour of that, but their view has been overruled. Next, failure by a trader to explain the disappearance of assets is to be made a criminal act. I think that is quite right, and that it should be made a criminal offence where a trader trading with other people's money cannot explain where it has gone. The next important amendment makes it a criminal offence where the insolvency is brought about by gambling. I must say I differ from that provision, and I think immense difficulty will be experienced in saying what is gambling in the criminal sense. One man, we will say, is trading in cotton and another in wheat. It seems to me that the very essence of those trades is buying cotton and selling cotton and buying wheat and selling wheat, and if a dealer in either of those commodities fails it is generally because he has bought at the wrong moment, or sold at the wrong moment. That is part of his trade, and I think it would be hard in these conditions to say that he had been guilty of a criminal act&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01887"><member>THE EARL OF GRANARD</member><membercontribution>: I would point out that the penalty in this Bill only applies to gambling unconnected with the trader's business. The instance which the noble Lord has given would be
<col>906</col>
connected with the business and would not come under the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01888"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD FABER</member><membercontribution>: I am obliged to the noble Earl for correcting me in that respect. If it is possible to designate what is gambling connected with the business and what is gambling outside the business, I shall be satisfied; but I fear that when you come to work the provision it will be extremely difficult. Then under this Bill all married women engaged in trade are made amenable to the laws of this country. Apparently in these days women want to take part in everything. They take part in trade, and. therefore they must expect to be made subject to the laws which govern ordinary traders. Additional restrictions are imposed by the Bill on the power to place property out of the reach of creditors in case of bankruptcy by means of covenants in marriage settlements. That is, to my mind, an important provision. When a single man commences business as a trader things may go well with him at first, and then be gets large credit and has a large amount of the money of the public in his possession, temporarily of course. He trades with that money; and then we will assume that things go wrong. He then says to himself, "How am I to get this money for myself?" and up to now there has been only one way. Being a single man he can get married and settle the whole of the creditors' money as a marriage settlement on his wife, and hitherto that could not be upset. Marriage has been held to be a good consideration, and therefore it is possible for a single man, if he wants to defraud his creditors, to get married and settle the whole of the money on his wife. Under this Bill that defect in the law is going to be taken in hand and put right. To my mind that is one of the good points in the Bill.<lb/>
Next, general assignments of book debts are to be void against a trustee in bankruptcy unless registered. I think that is a good provision. A charge on book debts ought to be registered just in the same way as bills of sale are now registered. Under this new provision it will be necessary for a register of such charges to be kept, and this register will set out exactly what traders are in a bad position and will give those who deal with them an opportunity of saving their skins. There is a further excellent provision in the Bill extending
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0479"/>
<col>907</col>
the control of Bankruptcy Courts over foreigners trading in this country. The City of London will be grateful for that enactment. But whether there will be any assets on this side when the foreigner fails I cannot say. This is, however, a move in the right direction, and this clause should certainly be carried. Noble Lords will be able to judge for themselves of the merits of the Bill when we go into Committee upon it. Personally I am of opinion that it is a good Bill, that it has been well drawn, that expert advice is very clear in every line of it, and I hope the Bill will pass into law in due course.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01889"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have no intention of saying anything which would place any impediment in the way of this Bill, but there are several matters in it of serious importance which will require, when we get into Committee, to be very carefully considered. I only mention them now in order that those who are supporting the Bill may have before their minds the questions that will arise. In the first place, I think the question of whether or not the procedure is to be by Court of Summary Jurisdiction or by indictment is a matter of the greatest importance. Some of these offences are very serious, and the question of whether or not you are to abolish trial by jury in some cases is one which, I think, will require to be very carefully considered. And not only so, but if trial by jury is to be abolished in certain cases the persons to whom power is given to order that the procedure should be by Court of Summary Jurisdiction ought to be defined. Nothing is more unsatisfactory to my mind than leaving it in the position in which it is left in this Bill. My noble friend behind me (Lord Faber) spoke of its being very important that certain cases should be capable of being dealt with at once. But it is more important, I think, when you are dealing with the liberty of the subject to consider who shall determine the question of what tribunal shall have jurisdiction in the matter. That, I think, will have to be seriously considered.<lb/>
There are one or two matters which I venture to say have not been sufficiently considered in the drafting of this Bill. Your Lordships are aware that at one time the only person who could be made a bankrupt was a trader. The distinction

was very marked, and there are a great number of decisions upon it. I observe that in answer to a criticism the noble Earl in charge of the Bill spoke of an offence "connected with a man's business." What is the meaning of the word "business"? The distinction between a trader and an ordinary person becomes of serious importance here, but I do not find that there has been any very definite idea on the point in the mind of the draftsman of this Bill. A criticism made just now across the Table illustrates the importance of this matter. It was pointed out that some businesses are necessarily of a gambling character, and, if gambling is to be made an offence, that question must be dealt with. It must be defined what gambling is in the sense in which it is used in this Bill.<lb/>
I do not wish to prolong this discussion, but I most strongly object to and shall certainly resist, when this Bill reaches Committee, a Government Department being given power to decide whether persons shall be prosecuted for a minor offence or for a graver offence; because, if the case goes to the minor tribunal the jurisdiction is limited and only certain punishment can be awarded, whereas if it goes to the other tribunal there is a power of inflicting much larger punishment. The power in this matter, if confided to anybody, should be given to the Public Prosecutor, who is the officer responsible for the due administration of the law. I strongly object to leaving it in the uncertain way in which it is left in this Bill, and at all events I object to a Government Department having this power.<lb/>
Then I would ask those who are responsible for the drafting of this Bill to be good enough to read Clause 2 and then tell me, if they were deciding on the question of what the offence was, whether or not that clause expounds with sufficient clearness to the ordinary intellect what it means. It first says that the person accused shall have the onus of proving that he was not guilty of this, that, or the other. Then it says it shall not be necessary to insert the allegation that it was done with the intent that the clause means to make unlawful, and, having done that, it says it shall neither be necessary to allege it in the indictment nor to prove it. How the onus of proof is to remain on the person accused under those circumstances puzzles me
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0480"/>
<col>909</col>
beyond measure. It becomes to my mind a serious thing to say there shall be an offence which it shall not be necessary to allege in the indictment; and that a person should be capable of being convicted on that seems to me to be a sort of thing that requires sonic defence at all events. I do not propose to detain your Lordships longer. I only rose to point out that there are several serious natters in this Bill which must be considered when we reach the Committee stage; and upon one of them, at all events, I certainly should resist this Bill if it were made an essential part of it that a Government Department should have jurisdiction to determine what tribunal should try a man.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01890"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (EARL LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have no cause to complain of the noble and learned Earl's criticism. He has indicated what must have been apparent to your Lordships, that when you are dealing with Bankruptcy Law you are dealing with a highly technical and difficult subject. The Common Law of the land is difficult; the Statute Law is made more difficult than it need be; Equity Law is difficult; but in the case of the Bankruptcy Law what you have to do is to adjust between rival claims to a denuded property what are the respective rights between the one and the other owing to the insolvency which has arisen, and this is, so to speak, an additional difficulty super-added to the sufficient difficulties that already exist in construing and applying the general law of the land. This Bill is brought forward for the reasons stated by my noble friend Lord Granard. It is unquestionably true that a good many people succeed in cheating by successive insolvencies honest traders who have no means of obtaining proper reparation, and it is necessary to use the Criminal Law as well as the Civil Law in order to make it clear to people that they cannot with impunity perpetrate a series of transactions which are practically, taken altogether, equivalent to fraud and to criminal misconduct, although in each particular instance they may be able to evade the effects of the law as it at present stands.<lb/>
The criticisms that have been made to which I propose to advert are three in number. One of them is the difficulty of describing gambling. It is, no doubt, a very difficult thing to do. But the fact that you cannot, if you cannot&#x2014;I do not
<col>910</col>
say that it might rot be practicable to do something to make it clearer&#x2014;describe a particular offence in language which is exhaustive, so to speak, is not necessarily an objection. All the great Judges in this country have from the very first refused to give any definition of the word "fraud," on the ground that if they gave a definition which would limit the conception of fraud with which they were at liberty to deal, rogues would immediately seize the definition and use it as a means of escaping the consequences of their misconduct. It may be possible to use other language, as well as the word "gambling," for the purpose of preventing a misuse of the enactment. But we must not attempt to be too detailed o too particular, or we shall find that the net is so wide that rascals will be able to escape.<lb/>
The next point to which the noble and learned Earl referred was that which relates to procedure by summary jurisdiction and to the proposed faculty for a Government Department&#x2014;the Board of Trade&#x2014;to avail itself of the power of proceeding by summary prosecution. It is only in minor cases that this could be done, and then only after the Judge had ordered a prosecution. Therefore the Department would not be arraigning people of its own sweet will. The Board of Trade would merely say, This is a small case, the Judge has ordered a prosecution, and we propose that the prosecution should take place, not before a Judge and jury, but before a Court of Summary Jurisdiction. At the same time what the noble and learned Earl has said will be listened to with the greatest respect, and I will consider what he has said with all the deference that one would give to his opinion on this matter.<lb/>
The other clause to which the noble and learned Earl adverted is Clause 2. His criticism there was as to the drafting. Drafting is a subject which certainly lays itself open to very constant criticism in this and in the other House of Parliament. I feel sure, knowing as I do that this Bill had its origin in the advice given by Mr. Montague Muir Mackenzie and the other gentlemen referred to, that these things have been carefully considered. But all these points will, as I say, deserve to be considered carefully in Committee, and we shall not forget the observations made upon them by the noble and learned Earl.</membercontribution></p>

<col>911</col>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01891"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise, not to give my useless opinions upon these most complicated matters of law, but in order to draw the attention of your Lordships to one or two points in connection with this matter. In the first place, I would like to ask the Government to give us a little time before taking the Committee stage of the Bill. Any one who has listened to the short discussion this evening must have been convinced of two things&#x2014;first, that the matter is intensely complicated; and, secondly, that the most learned members of your Lordships' House are not altogether in agreement with the Government as to the drafting of the Bill. Those two points make it very important that we should have time to consider the Bill. It is quite true, as stated by the noble Earl who represents the Board of Trade, that this Bill was presented last December, but it was not defended then; it was not even explained, and I doubt whether it has attracted the amount of attention outside which is fitting if the Bill is to be properly considered.<lb/>
The only other matter to which I should like to draw your Lordships' attention is this. Every speech which has been delivered this evening has been directed to bankruptcies arising in trade and commerce. Those are not the only bankruptcies with which the law deals, though they are no doubt the most important. Enough has been said of bankruptcies arising in trade by noble Lords much more qualified to speak upon them than I am. Therefore I will leave them alone. But there are other bankruptcies, and I wonder whether the Government in drafting this Bill have carefully considered its effect upon bankruptcies which do not arise amongst the business community. It is somewhat difficult to construe the Bill when you apply it to bankruptcies which do not arise commercially. Take the gambling provision, to which attention has been called. The gambling which is to be criminal is gambling not connected with the bankrupt's business. But if the bankrupt has no business, how are you to construe that clause? If it is to be construed in its widest sense, is it to be held that a person who becomes bankrupt in consequence of gambling, even of reckless gambling, is to be held guilty of a criminal offence? That may be right, but it is a very serious proposition to make. I do not think it is
<col>912</col>
probably the intention of the clause, neither am I qualified to say that the clause would be right to include it. But it is evident that the words require very careful scrutiny in order that a provision of this kind should not be made too wide.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01892"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: The noble Marquess is quite right, but already under the existing law gambling may be a ground for refusing a bankrupt his discharge. It is a different thing and has different consequences; but the fact of gambling is now judicial, if I may use the expression, and has to be considered by Courts of Law for another purpose.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01893"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: The noble and learned Earl's interruption is really directed towards the criticism of my noble and learned friend behind me, that it is difficult to define what "gambling" is. What I understand the Lord Chancellor now to say is that certain judicial persons already have to form an opinion of what gambling is. The criticism which I made still remains&#x2014;that it is exceedingly difficult to apply the provision as to gambling to bankruptcies which do not arise commercially without facing a change in the criminal law of a very serious kind which I hardly think the Government intend.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Faber approved very much of the provision in this Bill which deals with marriage settlements. I agree with him in principle, because it is sought by the clause to avoid a method of evading the bankruptcy law by a man who is about to become bankrupt. But are the Government quite sure that they have not drawn their net too wide, and that they may not prejudice one of the parties to the marriage in a perfectly <i>bona fide</i> and legitimate transaction&#x2014;persons not engaged necessarily in commerce at all? Take this case. Provision is made on behalf of a lady about to be married that certain property should be put into settlement. But if the husband within two years became bankrupt, she and those who were responsible for her welfare&#x2014;her father or her guardian&#x2014;might suddenly find that the settlement executed on her behalf was rendered null and void, and that the
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0482"/>
<col>913</col>
property which was supposed to make her future secure had to be paid away to the creditors of the husband. I hope your Lordships will not think that I am attempting for a moment to accurately interpret the drafting of this most complicated provision, but I give this instance in order to illustrate my point. I hope that His Majesty's Government will see that in legislating for commercial bankruptcies they do not affect adversely a number of comparatively innocent persons who are not engaged in commerce at all. What little I have been able to add to your Lordships' consideration of this Bill leads to the same conclusion with which I begun&#x2014;namely, that the House is entitled to certain time in which to consider carefully the provisions of this Bill, and I hope His Majesty's Government will not hurry us in taking the Committee stage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01894"><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think it is very reasonable in the case of a Bill of this complexity that sufficient time should be taken to look into it, and I suggest that the Committee stage should be taken on Tuesday the 14th instant, which will give nearly a fortnight. The noble Marquess has put rather too severe an interpretation upon the clause which deals with marriage settlements. This is not a clause for voiding a settlement of property made in consideration of marriage. It is a clause for the purpose of putting a restriction on what is a very common practice and what sometimes amounts to fraud. I refer to the case in which a man, in. consideration of marriage, covenants that a large debt is to be created out of his assets in prejudice of his creditors. There is no reason why that should be allowed. What happens is that a covenant is entered into to settle on the wife, say,&#x00A3;100,000 by a man who is going into trade. He then finds that his business is not flourishing, and he proceeds, as his bankruptcy approaches, to strip his estate by placing property out of the reach of creditors. What the Bill proposes is to leave the covenant standing, but that it shall not be operative to enable the trustees claiming under the covenant to claim in competition with the ordinary creditors. The covenant is binding, but the trustees cannot claim in competition with ordinary creditors. That is a reasonable thing to do, and certainly this is a case where a remedy
<col>914</col>
is wanted. Where property is conveyed in consideration of marriage, that case is expressly saved and is not touched. As regards the question of gambling, it is extremely difficult to lay down an abstract line between what ought to be prohibited and what ought not, but your Lordships will notice that no prosecution is to be instituted under this clause except by order of the Court which has the whole of the situation before it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01895"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: Will that be a Summary Court?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01896"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: No, the Bankruptcy Court which has investigated the circumstances. One sees almost every week in the newspapers bankruptcies where the liabilities are a tremendous amount and the assets <i>nil</i>. The clause provides that in determining for the purposes of this section whether any speculations were rash and hazardous the Court shall take into consideration the financial position of the accused person at the time when he entered into the speculations. If the Court knows that the bankrupt has been a fool or has been misled, it will not order a prosecution. But these tremendous speculations so often result in great misery to other people that some check ought to be put upon them. As my noble and learned friend on the Woolsack has explained, we already deal with gambling for the purpose of suspending the bankrupt's discharge, and the question of what is gambling is one with which the Courts are very familiar. It is a question to which the Courts do not come without experience. There are a great many attempts at a definition, and great light has been cast upon it by the decisions of the Courts. I should say for myself that taking Clause 4 there ought to be no difficulty in deciding what is a right case and what is a wrong case for prosecution. But that, like the other matters referred to, will be open for consideration in Committee. I have only risen to assure the noble Marquess opposite that the complication of the matter has not escaped the attention of the very experienced persons who prepared this Bill.</membercontribution></p>

But in the absence of the noble Lord the Chairman of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of England, I desire to make one allusion to a clause in the noble Lord's Bill and to point out to him that it goes in direct opposition to the First Interim Report of the Royal Commission on the ancient monuments of Hertfordshire, the first county with which the Commission dealt. In subsection (2) of Clause 2 of this Bill the noble Lord proposes that&#x2014;
<quote>"Where an Order of the Commissioner of Works is made under this section the Royal Commission shall forthwith, and in any case within six months from the date of such Order, inspect the monument which is the subject of the Order and report whether, in their opinion, the monument is especially worthy of preservation."</quote>
In their Interim Report the Royal Commission say&#x2014;
<quote>"We have from time to time been asked for advice and assistance with respect to the preservation of monuments which have been threatened with destruction. In these cases we have tried to give such help as lay within our power. But we are agreed that, having regard to the conditions under which we carry on our work, it would seriously impair the efficiency of our inquiry were it expected that we should at any moment interrupt its settled course in order to report upon the nature and value of threatened monuments in counties outside the immediate purview of the Commission."</quote>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01903"><member>THE FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I may be allowed to say a few words on this Bill, and to welcome it on behalf of His Majesty's Government as being yet another sign of the interest which is taken by members of your Lordships' House in the question of the preservation of ancient monuments. Like the noble Earl who has just sat down, I should be unwilling to express any decided opinion on the merits of the Bill. There are two things proposed in this Bill. One of them follows the suggestion which was thrown out by the noble Earl, Lord Curzon, on Tuesday last, that instead of proceeding by the purchase of monuments we should say that the rights which would exist under the Preservation Order should not be taken away by the sale of any monument. In that way the noble Earl thought that the Treasury would be saved an expenditure of money and that the public would be protected. I think now, as I thought then, that that is a valuable suggestion. It is proposed in this Bill that that b suggestion should be carried out. The method by which it is proposed to carry it out is a method to which the noble Earl, Lord Plymouth, takes sonic objection on behalf of the Royal Commission. The method suggested is that it should be done on the recommendation of some member or members of the Royal Commission. I do not suppose that the noble Lord in charge of the Bill would look upon that as an integral or vital part of this scheme, and I am not sure that if it was carried out by some other body well qualified to do it it might not meet the objection raised by the Royal Commission, and at the same time, if it was agreeable to the Select Committee, prove a method more generally acceptable in carrying out the object which we all have at heart. I venture, therefore, to hope that your Lordships will agree to refer this Bill, with the other two Bills on the same subject, to the proposed Joint Committee, and that as a result we may have a workable scheme to which we may all be able to give our hearty support.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE CLOSING OF THE DARDANELLES.</title>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01906"><member>LORD NEWTON</member> had the following Question upon the Paper&#x2014;"To ask His Majesty's Government whether they have addressed any representation to the Italian Government with reference to the closing of the Dardanelles."</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01907">The noble Lord said: My Lords, since I put this Question on the Paper I observe in the Press that a temporary arrangement has been arrived at by which the Dardanelles are partially reopened, but this is obviously a merely temporary arrangement because it is quite clear that it is liable to be upset in consequence of any additional action being taken by the Italian Fleet. As no Parliamentary Papers have been laid with regard to this particular question and as no general statement has, so far as I know, been made by His Majesty's Government, it occurred to me that they might, perhaps, be glad to take the present opportunity of making one. At the same time I do not think there is any harm in pointing out in a very few sentences how the present situation has arisen. It is now more than seven months since the Italians sent, practically simultaneously, an Ultimatum and a large Expeditionary Force to Tripoli, and that action was followed shortly afterwards by a somewhat premature declaration of annexation. The military operations in Tripoli have proved to be considerably more difficult than was anticipated, and events have marched very slowly. So far as one can gather, a condition of stale-mate exists at the present moment. The Italians are unable to advance&#x2014;they have not advanced outside the range of the guns of their ships; and the Turkish and Arab force is incapable of turning them out from the towns which they occupy.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01908">In consequence of this state of things the Italian Government have carried the war into different parts of the Turkish Empire in opposition to what I believe was their original intention. In pursuance of this policy they have bombarded various places in the Red Sea; they have sunk a certain number of Turkish ships; they have made demonstrations on the Syrian coast; they have seized and occupied some islands in the Archipelago, and, as a climax, they have attacked the Dardanelles. There are, apparently, various versions as to this particular attack. It has been said that it was a mistake and was not intended. I do not
<col>918</col>
think that, as a mater of fact, there can be very much doubt as to what the intention was. It must be fairly obvious that the intention was not to make a serious and determined attack upon the Dardanelles, but to create a considerable amount of confusion in Europe, to cause a great deal of inconvenience, and so to bring about the coercion of the Turkish Government by the action of the Powers which were inconvenienced. International morality may not be on a very high level at the present moment, but, at all events, this apparent attempt to prevent people front defending themselves when they have been attacked in an entirely unprovoked way has not met with success.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01909">It will probably be said that the Italian Government, being a belligerent, have the right to make war in any way they choose, and to attack any part of the Turkish Empire which they may feel inclined to do. In principle they are obviously entitled to carry out this course, but I desire to point out that in practice they are doing nothing of the kind. The natural point of attack for the Italians would obviously be the Albanian coast. Italy has long nourished ambitions with regard to Albania. Italy considers that she has important interests there. It is an open secret that Turkey has not been attacked on the Adriatic in consequence of the action of the Austrian Government. The Austrian Government have warned the Italians off the Adriatic and off the Gulf of Salonica, and this action has been taken, so far as we are able to judge, without impairing the relations between the two countries. Those relations apparently continue to be friendly. The Ministers of the two respective Governments make speeches in which they allude to their respective countries in friendly terms, and Italy remains a party to the Triple Alliance. What I desire to ask is why, if the Austrians have been able to obtain this concession, we and other Powers are not able to obtain the same for ourselves. We are all neutrals. All these Powers are neutrals. Why should the Austrians he placed in a privileged position, and why should not all neutrals be treated in the same way?</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01910">If we attempt any thing in the nature of the action which has been taken by the Austrian Government, is there any serious danger of our imperilling our present friendly relations with the Italian Govern-
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0485"/>
<col>919</col>
ment? It seems to me that we have given the most unmistakable evidence of our friendliness to the Italians during the present contest. Perhaps we have gone even further in that direction than many persons would approve. His Majesty's Government, so far as I know, have never made any sort of protest against Italian action, although we have been considerably inconvenienced. They have never condemned that action. The Press of this country has, upon the whole, been entirely upon the Italian side; and we have stretched our friendship to the Italians even to this point, that as far as I can gather we have prevented even unarmed or unorganised bodies of men passing through Egypt in order to serve as volunteers with the Turkish and Arab forces, Egypt being, it must be remembered, still a part of the Ottoman Empire. I do not think it would be possible to stretch friendship as a neutral further than we have done in this particular case. Surely in view of what we have clone, and putting aside, for the present at all events, all questions of morality, we are entitled to ask that the war should not be conducted in a way which has become almost intolerable, as far as we are concerned, and that it should be localised as much as possible in accordance with the original intention. This I venture respectfully to submit can be best secured by asking the Italian Government to make a plain declaration of its policy, and asking that Government at the same time whether it will agree to totally exclude the Dardanelles from the area of war. And if it is suggested to me that Italy is a friendly Power and that therefore we are not entitled to make a request of that kind, my reply is, and I think it is an obvious one, that Turkey is a friendly Power too, and that this is not a war which has been of her seeking.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01911"><member>LORD NUNBURNHOLME</member> also had the following Notice on the Paper&#x2014;"To ask why His Majesty's Government do not take steps to ensure the free passage of British ships through the Dardanelles."</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01912">The noble Lord said: My Lords, perhaps it will be convenient that I should put the Question standing in my name before the noble Viscount replies on behalf of His Majesty's Government to the speech of the noble Lord opposite. What I should like to call the attention of the Government to is the very serious losses that are being
<col>920</col>
caused to the trade and commerce of the whole of Europe, especially to the trade and commerce between Turkey and South Russia and England&#x2014;apparently because the Italians have come to a deadlock in their war with Turkey. Of course, it is not for us at the present moment to go into the merits of this disastrous and unhappy war, but I cannot press too strongly on His Majesty's Government that they ought to obtain from the Italian Government some pronouncement that the sphere of operations is to be limited. The day before yesterday I took the trouble to telegraph to Constantinople to ascertain how many ships were held up, and I received a reply saying that there w ere 185 vessels inside and outside the Dardanelles unable to move. It is unnecessary for me to point out to your Lordships the enormous value of the cargoes on board those ships. Many of those cargoes are at present deteriorating. Further than that, it is a well known fact that all bankers have stopped making advances on bills of lading, and the whole of the trade in that part of _Europe has come to a state of absolute chaos. We are still a great Naval nation, and I think that we ought to make some show of protecting our own interests in this matter and give proof that there is some use in being the predominant Naval Power, if there is no other way of bringing about a solution of the difficulty.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01913"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT MORLEY)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure my noble friend will not suppose for a moment that His Majesty's Government have been indifferent to the disastrous state of things&#x2014;it deserves no less serious a word than that&#x2014;which has been existing for several days in the Black Sea and the Dardanelles. The figure of 185, which my noble friend said was the information he got yesterday, does not quite correspond with our own. It is rather higher than we should put it, but it is not worth while arguing for a moment as to whether it is 185 or 135. The root fact remains that we are suffering huge damage. In the matter of the grain trade, and perhaps the oil trade, Russia suffers more than we do, South Russia being greatly dependent on our market, but we are suffering peculiarly in shipping. In shipping our predominance is extraordinary; shipping ordinarily passing through the Dardanelles is largely British. The total tonnage of shipping arriving at Constantinople in 1909,
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0486"/>
<col>921</col>
the date of the latest Consular report, amounted to 15&#x00BE;million tons. Of this 6&#x00BE;millions were British, 2&#x00BE;millions were Greek, 1&#x00BC;millions were Austrian, and 1 million was German. We have no information at the Board of Trade as to the shipping now, but the foregoing figures of the ordinary traffic show satisfactorily our supremacy in commerce in the Black Sea and how the relative effects of this disastrous closing of the Straits were distributed.<lb/>
I think my noble friend will feel that it is not worth while to go further into the details of the transactions between ourselves and the Governments of Turkey and Italy. But let me assure him that, since the Straits were closed, we have been in constant communication with both those Governments, and he has seen to-day in the public prints that, after no unreasonable length of time, considering the difficulties of the Porte in coming to a decision, after we had taken prompt and friendly steps to call their attention to the mischief which is being done to the great interests of ourselves, and, after taking reasonable time for consideration, we heard from our Ambassador, last night, I think, the intelligence which has already, in a less formal shape, been given through the public Press. Yesterday the Porte informed the Ambassador that it had been decided upon to open the Dardanelles under the same conditions as existed before its closing, namely, that vessels must pass with pilots. The opening will take place as soon as ever the mines can be removed, but the Ottoman Government&#x2014;it may be of interest to the noble Lord opposite&#x2014;maintains its absolute right to close the Dardanelles completely in case, and as soon as, the necessity should arise.<lb/>
The noble Lord opposite was, I think, rather unreasonable in asking His Majesty's Government here to make a general statement surveying all our relations with the Porte and with the Italian Government at Rome and other Powers. I think unreasonable because&#x2014;and no one in the House will understand, it better than the noble Lord himself&#x2014;it cannot be expected that, when you are in the middle of a war in which you are maintaining an absolute and firm neutrality, the Government should be called upon to produce all the Despatches, all the telegrams, all the
<col>922</col>
interchanges of views. I am sure he will feel in his conscience that that is not a fair thing to expect. Nor can the noble Lord expect me now to get up and follow him in the criticism he made of something that Austria-Hungary is supposed to have done, what the relations are between Austria-Hungary and Russia and Italy, what promise or undertaking has been given by Italy to Austria, and so on. Then the noble Lord, having assumed that there has been an undertaking by Austria-Hungary to Italy and <i>vice versa</i>, asks why we do not approach Italy to exact from her the same kind of undertaking in our own regard that he assumes she has given to Austria-Hungary. That is not at all a reasonable position to take up. Then he says plainly that we ought to protest to Italy that we cannot endure, being, as my noble friend said, the supreme Naval Power, these roving operations of war. I wonder that he with his diplomatic experience thinks it possible for a Government that is firmly neutral to say to either of the two belligerent Powers, "You shall not carry on the war in the way you are doing."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01914"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: I am sorry to interrupt the noble Viscount, but that is precisely what the Austrian Government has done.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01915"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: It is what the noble Lord says Austria has done, but I submit that nothing could be more inexpedient than that we should in this House assume that the Austrian Government has done this or that, and on the basis of that assumption we are to be catechised and interrogated as to whether we will not undertake the same step. You cannot. I am amazed that the noble Lord does not agree with this. He must agree. Could we in reason be asked to say either to Turkey or to Italy, "We will prescribe to you the limits within which you shall carry on your military operations"? If they came into the Thames then we should have something to say. But to say that Turkey is not to defend herself and that Italy is not to follow her own plans of military operations would be a serious departure from an attitude of non-intervention. There are those, I know&#x2014;I am not sure that there is not a member of this House&#x2014;who, by way of speculation to avoid the evils of war,
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0487"/>
<col>923</col>
wish that the Powers of the world at The Hague or elsewhere should agree to the acceptance of some sort of principle to the effect that the area of a war should be strictly localised and limited. That may or may not prove ultimately a step towards the civilisation of war and the conveniences of war, but it is no use for us to-day who have practical business on our hands and who have the difficulties and the inconveniences of the hour to settle, to assume any realisation of a speculation of that kind. When the correspondence and telegrams are, in the fulness of time, published in a Blue-book I will undertake to say that the House and the country will find that we have thoroughly and assiduously followed the full duties of a firmly neutral Power between these two belligerents.<lb/>
The noble Lord said nothing about the Turkish case. We have done full justice to the Turkish case. The Turkish Government have a right to take all legitimate means for the defence of their own territory. No treaty can oblige Turkey when her actual and immediate safety is concerned to open the passage giving free access to the destruction, if necessary, of her own capital. You could not expect that. Another point. This is rather against those who are impatient&#x2014;some, like the noble Lord, at our being so patient with Italy, and others at our being so patient with Turkey. We hold a completely equal balance. With regard to the Turkish case, when their military authorities tell them that to abandon the defence by mines would be an equivalent to a reduction of their power of defence by about 50 per cent., such a consideration a neutral Government like ourselves is bound to take into account. I will say this. Neither the noble Lord nor anybody in the House will deny the obligation by which Turkey is bound to keep open the Straits under the Treaty of Paris, 1856, the Treaty of London, 1871, and the Treaty of 1878. She is bound to keep the Straits open for neutral commerce unless some immediate and direct necessity for her own safety should arise. We have held that in full regard. But now I think we might say that, while the principle that the Straits are to be kept open to commerce unless danger is actual or imminent imposes an obligation on Turkey from the point of view of international morality, it carries with it the corresponding expediency&#x2014;<lb/>
<col>924</col>
I will not put it higher than that&#x2014;that that principle should not be strained and overstrained in case of war by other parties to it.<lb/>
The noble Lord indulged himself in a rather cynical interpretation of the attack on the Dardanelles. I have seen it in the public prints, and it comes to this, that neither the Italian nor the Turkish Government were averse to inflicting severe inconvenience on neutrals on the chance of hastening the effective intervention of those neutrals in bringing to an end what is certainly apparently an extraordinarily obscure and ambiguous military issue.<lb/>
As to Italy, I confess I was rather sorry to hear at this stage of things the tone of the noble Lord. I have said it before and say it again, we cannot insist on either of these belligerents foregoing their full belligerent rights or limiting them for the convenience of neutral States. May I add the consideration, and I venture to think it is well worthy of the attention of your Lordships' House, that it would be a very great mistake if in our natural impatience with such transactions as have recently taken place in the Dardanelles we were to leave out of sight the wider elements that affect both the Turkish and Italian cases and our attitude with regard to these cases. It would be a great mistake if we left out of sight with regard to Turkey the enormous Mahomedan interests with which we are concerned. With regard to Italy, on the other hand, it would certainly be an immense, and I will even say a lamentable, mistake, if we were to forget our friendship, our long traditional friendship, with Italy in the past, and, more than that, if we were to forget our concern in her position and relations as a Mediterranean Power. I do not think I need say more. I have disappointed, I am sure, the noble Lord. I could not make, and. I do not think he could expect it, a general statement of all that has been going on in this matter. We, at all events, have got for the time a situation which is better than a few days ago we could have hoped.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01916"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I desire to offer a few observations about one remark which was dropped incidentally by the noble Lord who raised this discussion. He referred to the neutrality
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0488"/>
<col>925</col>
of Egypt, and appeared to think that the enforced neutrality of Egypt was insisted upon by His Majesty's Government on account of their friendliness for Italy. I do not know what has been going on recently on this subject and I am not in the secrets of the Foreign Office, but I conceive I am not far wrong in saying that it would have been a departure from neutrality to have shown any special friendliness either to Italy or to Turkey. I do not think that the reason why the neutrality of Egypt was insisted upon was due so much to friendliness towards Italy as to a due regard for the interests of Egypt itself and of all the people who reside there. It would have been a disastrous thing for Egypt if they had been dragged into this quarrel, with which they have no sort of concern, and I think His Majesty's Government have done extremely well in keeping them out of it. I make these few remarks because if the idea got abroad in Egypt that we were not acting in Egyptian interests but rather in the interests of Italy, it might do some harm, and I think it is just as well to put the matter right.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01917"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have all listened with interest to the statement of the noble Viscount, and for myself I am prepared to say that I heard that statement on the whole with considerable satisfaction. The noble Viscount may perhaps have fallen short of the expectations of my noble friend on the Back Bench (Lord Newton). My noble friend certainly favours strenuous methods of diplomacy, which I cannot help thinking might not be found quite so easy of application as he supposes. At any rate the noble Viscount must have convinced all those who listened to him that he and his colleagues fully realise the great gravity of the situation which has arisen in the Eastern Mediterranean. I will not repeat what he has said as to the magnitude of oar interests in the commerce of the Black Sea, or as to the grave menace to those interests which we discern in the recent dislocation of that trade. It is satisfactory to know that His Majesty's Government have spared no efforts to bring about a mitigation of those circumstances, and that they have been able to achieve at any rate a certain amount of success.<lb/>
The noble Viscount said a word as to the Treaty obligations of Turkey, and
<col>926</col>
there I entirely agree with him. I think he might have gone back even to the Treaty of Adrianople to show the obligation of Turkey to keep the Dardanelles open for the passage of peaceful traders. The noble Viscount is no doubt correct when he tells us that that obligation must be interpreted subject to the inherent rights of Turkey to take whatever measures are reasonable, necessary, or justifiable to ensure her own safety. The Turkish I Government no doubt in this case claims that the temporary sealing of the Straits was a measure indispensable to secure the Turkish capital, and I think she may fairly add the argument that this unfortunate conflict was not one of her seeking and that it was not due to any action of hers that the area of the warlike operations now in progress was extended in a manner which most of us greatly deplore. But, my Lords, whatever the strict rights of the Turkish Government may be, we all of us feel that they should not be strained, and that the utmost regard should be paid to the interests and claims of all concerned, in the peaceful trade of the Mediterranean. It is, I think, creditable to the Turkish Government that they should have frankly recognised this, as I understand to be the case, and that they should have undertaken to open the Straits to the same extent as they were open before these lamentable events, subject to certain regulations as to pilotage which are no doubt indispensable in the circumstances.<lb/>
The accounts given in the newspapers of the conditions under which Turkey has agreed to this concession suggest one or two points which are perhaps a little disconcerting. In the telegram published in <i>The Times</i> this morning it is stated that in the Turkish reply which was communicated to the Russian Government the day before yesterday Turkey announces that the Turkish Government is anxious to reopen the Straits as soon as that is possible "without danger." I take it that that points to danger from mines, and I recall a statement that was made in the House a few days ago by the noble Viscount, in which he told us that there were still some mines the whereabouts of which was not precisely known, and it naturally occurs to one that some time may elapse before the Turkish Government considers itself in a position to intimate that no danger can arise to
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0489"/>
<col>927</col>
vessels passing through the Straits. Let us hope that the period of suspense may not he too much prolonged. In the same telegram it is said that Turkey will reopen the straits as soon as Italy gives pledges not to repeat her attack on the Dardanelles. I should be glad if the noble Viscount is able to tell us whether there is any truth in that statement, because obviously that would be a very serious limitation to the Turkish announcement and one which might make it much less satisfactory than we now believe it to be.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01918"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: That assertion in the newspaper is quite inconsistent with the words used to our Ambassador yesterday or the day before.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01919"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I am very glad to have elicited that statement. It will give great relief to many who have read this telegram and were a little alarmed by it. This is perhaps hardly the occasion for dwelling upon the larger aspects of the case, but they are very important. We think, of course, of ourselves, and of the&#x00A3;20,000 which we are said to be losing every day during the time when the Straits are sealed. But the real question which will no doubt have to be considered sooner or later is the extent to which a belligerent Power, controlling narrow waters which form a great trade avenue for the commerce of the world, is justified in entirely closing such an avenue in order to facilitate the hostile operations in which that Power finds itself involved. That is a very serious matter. There is a certain analogy between that case and the case of some of those unfortunate trade disputes which we have been lately discussing. It seems to me that just as public opinion in any country would be slow to tolerate arrangements under which a local trade dispute might have the effect of paralysing the whole industrial life of the country, so public opinion amongst the great nations would be slow to tolerate a state of things under which a local conflict involving only two Powers would be allowed to create such serious detriment and disturbance to the whole trading community of the world. I hope I may infer from the words of the noble Viscount that our diplomacy is being directed to obtain the recognition of that principle, and I entirely agree that whatever our policy may be in this matter we should
<col>928</col>
proceed tactfully and without undue impatience, bearing in mind upon the one hand the relations in which we stand to the Turkish Empire Owing to the great number of his Majesty's Mahomedan subjects, and upon the other hand our old friendship with Italy, which should certainly, so far as possible, be taken into account in any diplomatic communications with her at a crisis which affects her so closely as this crisis does.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01971">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01972"><member>THE PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY TO THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (LORD LUCAS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the subject with which this Bill deals has already been discussed by your Lordships on the Report of Lord Haversham's Committee, and in that discussion, which took place on March 7 last, I stated that we proposed to introduce a Bill embodying some of the recommendations of that Committee. The recommendations contained in this Bill are the Committee's, third, fourth, and fifth recommendations. I do not think it necessary to say anything about the other recommendations, because in the course of the recent discussion we gave the reasons why we were not prepared to take up any of the recommendations with regard to purchase. But, besides those, there were other recommendations of considerable importance, and those are the ones dealt with in this Bill. Only one of those recommendations&#x2014;the fourth&#x2014;which is embodied in the first clause of this Bill, can be considered in the least degree controversial.<lb/>
Clause 1 enacts that when notice is given to a tenant to quit for the purpose of sale, he shall be entitled to serve a counter-notice, which will enable him to remain in occupation of his farm for a year after the notice to quit would have taken effect. Legislation on this particular point has, in our opinion, been rendered necessary by the practice which has quite recently arisen, at least on any large scale, of giving notice to quit to the tenants before the land is put up for sale. This clause does not, of course, in any way apply to cases where what I may call the usual procedure up till the last few years still obtains&#x2014;namely, of selling the land without serving notice to quit on the tenants. we do not for a moment maintain that this provision in Clause 1 is, or can be considered, a sovereign remedy for the hardship which is occasionally created when land is sold over the tenant's head. Neither this recommendation nor any of the other recommendations of the Committee, nor, indeed, any recommendation that has ever been put forward, can meet that position; for the simple reason that where you have a man who is anxious to
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0492"/>
<col>933</col>
purchase land for his own occupation nothing that you can devise will prevent him from doing it, and when a person has made up his mind to purchase occupied land for this purpose somebody has to be dispossessed. That is the position which has to be faced, and the kind of disturbance that is thus created is bound to go on.<lb/>
But there is something besides that. Under the present system a great deal more disturbance and uncertainty is created than need be the case. I think this disturbance and uncertainty in the aggregate causes as much hardship as the actual hard cases themselves. The Committee expressed the opinion that actual hard cases are of extremely rare occurrence. The thing that happens at the present time on the majority of those estates where notice to quit has been served is something of this kind. The landowner, having made up his mind to offer land for sale and to afford the purchasers vacant possession, gives notice to quit to his tenants, and then within comparatively few months&#x2014;two or three months&#x2014;of the time when that notice would expire he puts the land up for sale. The tenant is thereby placed in a very difficult position. He has not the faintest idea as to what his fate is going to be. His land may be purchased by a person who is prepared to keep him on as a tenant on the old terms, or who might keep him on but exact a higher rent; but he may find that his farm has been purchased by some person who intends to occupy it himself. The position, therefore, is that until within something like three months of the time when his notice to quit expires he is in a state of complete uncertainty, and it amounts in a great many cases to the same thing as giving him three months' notice to quit. Within this period it is extremely difficult for the tenant to find another farm, and I have no doubt a great many cases have occurred where tenants have borrowed money to purchase their farms when they might very well have remained tenants. It came out in evidence before the Committee that, broadly speaking, the tenant farmers in this country desire to remain tenant farmers, and only purchase their land as a last alternative.<lb/>
One cannot, of course, foresee exactly what will be the effect of allowing the tenant to serve this counter-notice, but the probabilities are that it will have the
<col>934</col>
effect of stopping this new practice of serving notices upon tenants and thereby allay a great deal of uncertainty. It will, of course, give to the tenant time, after the sale has taker place, to make his arrangements should it become necessary for him to quit his farm; and instead of giving him three months to look round, it may very likely give him fifteen months; for if the landlord holds the sale at the same time as ho otherwise would have done, there will still remain after the sale has taken place a few months of the original year's notice to run, and there will also be the whole of the counter-notice year to run. That will give the tenant ample time in which to try and arrange terms with his new landlord, and, if he finds that he is not to be allowed to remain in possession of the land, it will give him time to look about and find another farm before he has to leave his present one, and that will make the whole difference to him.<lb/>
It has been suggested that the provision in this clause may have a bad effect in that it will prolong the period of uncertainty for the tenant; that a landlord will give notice, and, instead of holding the sale nine months after the time that he has given the notice, will hold it twenty-one months after. But, in regard to that, I would point out that a landlord who was selling a large portion of land on which there were a number of tenants could never be sure that the whole of his tenants would serve him with a counter-notice, and unless the whole of the tenants did so he would be in the difficult position of having a certain number of farms thrown upon his hands which he would have to farm up to the period of the sale, and I think that would act as a considerable deterrent to landlords taking that course. In cases where there was only a single tenant concerned, the date of the sale might be fixed according to whether or not counter-notice had been served. But, even so, matters would not be worse than they are now, and the tenant would be at any rate no worse off than he is at the present moment.<lb/>
This particular proposal was put before the Departmental Committee during the course of their deliberations, and it is interesting to observe the measure of support which it obtained. The proposal was put by the Committee before, I think, the majority of the witnesses who attended,
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0493"/>
<col>935</col>
and it was supported by, if not all, at any rate a great majority of those to whom it was put, and I think the names are rather interesting. Among the witnesses who expressed themselves as in favour of the proposal were Mr. C. W. Tindall, land agent, surveyor, and valuer, who was nominated to give evidence by the Surveyors' Institution; Mr. W. G. S. Rolleston, President of the Central Association of Agricultural and Tenant Right Valuers; Mr. Samuel Vergette, principal of the firm of Messrs. Fox and Vergette, auctioneers and land agents; Mr. Robert Gray, land agent; Alderman Illtyd Thomas, representing the Glamorgan Chamber of Agriculture; and Mr. Packard, Chairman of the Farmers' Club. Besides that, I think this recommendation was the most strongly supported on the Committee of any of their important recommendations. Ten members of the Committee were in favour of it, and out of the whole of the witnesses and members of the Committee before whom this proposal was definitely and explicitly placed, Mr. Frank and Captain Weigall, two members of the Committee, were the only two who opposed it.<lb/>
The strongest point in the opposition to this proposal is undoubtedly the contention that it may reduce the selling value of the land. I think there is no doubt that an intending purchaser who attached great importance to immediate possession would probably be prepared to pay a rather less high figure than he would if he was going to get vacant possession. But the man who wants immediate possession for the purpose of occupying the land is the man who is going to cause the greatest amount of hardship to the outgoing tenant. It is the fact that there are a certain number of people of that kind who really do want land and mean to have it. It is through the existence of those that these rather rare cases of hardship do arise. After all, you can only look at what actually does happen when land is sold. It is beyond dispute that when a landowner sells his land he becomes a very much richer man than he was before. The prices which land is fetching at the present moment make a man, from a financial point of view, better off. In other words, it is an extremely profitable transaction; and there is no question about it that the chief contributor to that, the person who has contributed largely to
<col>936</col>
that accretion of wealth on the sale of the land, is undoubtedly the tenant. You have, in these special circumstances where the tenant has to quit immediately after the sale, a case of hardship at once created; and where you have a transaction which is going to enrich the landlord and may very possibly, and probably in fact will, impoverish the tenant, it seems to me nothing more than common justice that you should have some give-and-take arrangement by which the tenant should not be made to suffer more than is necessary. If, as would be the case, the landlord got a little less price for his land, still the tenant would be saved from possible heavy loss, and it seems to me that it is only fair and right that the landlord should give up something for the benefit of the tenant.<lb/>
The second paragraph of Clause 1 deals with land which is bought for the purpose of small holdings, and we have followed the recommendations of the Committee in subjecting land of that kind to different treatment. We admit the principle which I have just stated, but we apply the remedy in a rather different form. The tenant of land which has been bought for small holdings will be entitled to compensation under the Small Holdings Act, 1910. That compensation, as your Lordships are aware, is paid out of the Small Holdings Fund. Broadly and approximately speaking, as far as our experience in cases that have arisen under the Small Holdings Act, 1910, can be taken as a guide, the compensation that he would receive may be regarded as equivalent to the amount that is usually paid to a tenant when it is desired to obtain possession of his land a year before the notice expires, so that, though the procedure is different, judged from a financial standpoint the treatment is the same. Clause 2 will do away with the system of six months' notice. That, I am glad to say, is a system which has already largely died out. It is probably a survival of the days prior to the Agricultural Holdings Act of 1875. The clause hardly needs justifying when one considers that agriculture is an industry which has to be conducted on a yearly basis. Clause 3 deals with what may be called reasonable exceptions. Clause 4 is important, because it enacts that disputes arising as to the notice to quit&#x2014;and I think there are bound to be disputes arising about it&#x2014;shall be settled by arbitration.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0494"/>
<col>937</col>
That is the whole of the Bill. As I say, it is a comparatively small Bill, but it is an attempt to deal with what undoubtedly is a rather serious feature in agriculture at the present moment. We believe that this system of counter-notice will alleviate, as far as any legislation can alleviate, not cases where a man has made up his mind to buy land for his own occupation and buys it and turns the tenant out, but a great deal of the rather unnecessary uncertainty and consequent hardship and loss of money created by this new system of serving notices to quit in the case of sales.

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01978"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as a member of the Committee who signed the Report which has formed the subject of the noble Lord's speech, I should be sorry in any way to oppose a measure which in any sense, or at all events in my own opinion, carried out that Report. But while I concur with a great deal that the noble Lord has said in moving the Second Reading of this Bill, I cannot agree that the Bill will meet the difficulties which the Committee discovered in the course of their investigations, or that it will, to use the noble Lord's words, alleviate, as far as legislation can alleviate, the hardships which tenants have to suffer. I think it is clear, reading the Report of the Committee and then reading this Bill, that this is a most inadequate attempt to deal with the problems which we found existing. It scarcely touches the fringe of the real question, and I am bound to say that it is a very great disappointment to me, and I think it will be to other members who served on that Committee, that after the many months of labour we bestowed on the question there should have come out such a really insignificant Bill as the present one appears to be.<lb/>
<col>938</col>
The noble Lord has stated the difficulties which the Committee were appointed to look into, and he also stated, what certainly appears in the evidence, that the number of cases of hardship which had arisen owing to the break-up of estates and other causes was not very great. But, in addition to actual cases of hardship, it was quite obvious to all who heard the evidence taken before the Committee that the operations of the Small Holdings Act and other things had brought about a feeling of real anxiety among tenant farmers which was doing away with the sense of security which tenant farmers always possessed before recent legislation. The security which a tenant has in carrying out his agricultural operations is of vast importance to him, and not only to him, but it has an effect upon the condition of agriculture; and keeping that in view I agree at once with the noble Lord that it is necessary that some legislation should be brought forward to meet those cases. This Bill, at all events, does not meet the difficulties. That was obviously the opinion of the Committee themselves, because they made it, I think, abundantly clear that in their view the only possible scheme to meet the case was a scheme of State-aided land purchase. That appears from the evidence of the great majority of the witnesses who came, before us, and the principle of State-aided land purchase was agreed to by every member of the Committee, except, I think, one.<lb/>
The fact that a Bill of this nature has been brought forward seems to show that the Government do not fully appreciate the real difficulty with which they have to deal. Or it may be that, finding the solution which the Committee had recommended so entirely against their view of the future of the land system of the country, they prefer that these difficulties should, go on rather than that they should meet the case by adopting the only solution which we know of so far. The Government have ignored altogether this main solution and have seized upon one comparatively small recommendation&#x2014;a recommendation which is only part of a much larger scheme. That recommendation is embodied in the first clause of this Bill, and it has already been explained to your Lordships by the noble Lord who has moved the Second Reading. I should like to point out&#x2014;and the Report of the Committee will confirm me&#x2014;that this particular solution, that of
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0495"/>
<col>939</col>
a counter-notice, was proposed merely as supplementary to our main solution of land purchase. The noble Lord will find that in the earlier part of the Report. It was for those who could not afford to buy that this was suggested. And following the actual recommendation in the Report the noble Lord will find that we stated that the clause would require exceedingly careful drafting to meet the difficulties. Yet we have in this Bill merely the crude and bald statement of the Committee themselves translated in almost the exact words.<lb/>
The object for which we proposed this recommendation was to deal with those particular cases where, owing to the very short period which could elapse between the sale of the farm and the expiry of the landlord's notice, there could not be sufficient time for the occupier to make his arrangements with the new owner, or, in the event of the new owner not agreeing to continue him, to find another place. This Bill will not meet that in any way. The noble Lord has suggested that, although it will not meet it, owners will not take advantage of this hole in the clause, for reasons which I could not fully understand. It seems to me quite obvious that owners will take advantage of it. Owners want to sell nowadays with vacant possession because purchasers require vacant possession. The scheme in this Bill merely postpones the evil day for the tenant and does nothing more. An owner gives notice, say, at Michaelmas, 1912, for his tenant to leave at Michaelmas, 1913. The tenant replies with a counter-notice, which gives him an extended period up to Michaelmas, 1914. The owner merely postpones his sale until June or July of 1914, and, if he sells the land, the tenant is in exactly the same position as he would be if this Bill had not been passed, with the added disadvantage that he has had two years of uncertainty instead of one, and that must have an effect upon the whole of the operations of the tenant throughout those two years.<lb/>
I say that this measure cannot help the tenant in any way. It has another disadvantage. Under the Agricultural Holdings Act, 1908, a tenant has certain advantages&#x2014;if they are advantages, and of that I am not quite certain&#x2014;of free sale of produce and of free cropping his land, but that power of free sale and free cropping
<col>940</col>
does not continue after notice has been given or received by either side, so that directly the counter-notice has been given there remain two years in which the tenant cannot avail himself of the advantages, if they are advantages, of that Act. In the first part of the clause with which I have dealt I can see no advantages whatever to the tenant. I cannot see that it meets the difficulties we want to meet in any way at all. But we see a much further disadvantage to the tenant in the proviso to this clause. The proviso is in connection with purchases by the county council. A tenant receives notice to quit, say, in October, 1912. He thereupon gives a counter-notice. Therefore he is quite safe in his farm until October, 1914. But in June or July, 1913, a county council come in and say, "You have to go out in two months; we want this farm." You provide in this clause that the counter-notice shall not apply when a county council wish to buy a farm for small holdings. The result is that, although this tenant has this additional period of security, he can be turned out at short notice by the county council, and he would in that case be in a much worse position than under the ordinary notice from his landlord.<lb/>
I hope that your Lordships will not pass this proviso. I know the reason for it. It arises from a remark made by the Committee, but it will require a great deal more thinking out before it is passed into law. The main question of the counter-notice, I believe, could be amended so as to make it of real advantage to the tenant. With regard to Clause 2, I think it is of considerable importance that the ordinary notice to quit should not be less than twelve months. Agriculturally speaking, anything less than twelve months is unsound. Prior to the year 1908 the notice to quit required by the Common Law was six months. Then by the Act of 1908 the period was increased to twelve months, unless some other agreement had been come to between the landlord and tenant. Now it is proposed to make the twelve months compulsory on the landlord's part but not on the tenant's part. The result is that, in the case of an agreement where six months' notice to quit is required, the tenant will still be allowed to give six months' notice, but any agreement on the landlord's part for less than twelve months' notice will be void.</membercontribution></p>

It would meet my point if the words "by a landlord" were left out, but as the clause at present stands it applies to a notice given by a landlord only. Of course, there are obvious exceptions which will have to be made in the case of the purchase of laud for building and other purposes, but as far as I can see they are all properly covered by Clause 3. I have criticised this Bill in the way I have done because I think it is in many respects a sham. It appears to have been brought in because it was expected that the Government should do something on the publication of the Committee's Report. But although it is a sham, it seems to me that it would be possible to make it into a useful measure, and for that reason I am not inclined to oppose it on Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01981"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HAVERSHAM</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I crave your Lordships' indulgence for a few minutes, as I was Chairman of the Departmental Committee on whose Report this Bill is founded. I am bound in honour to say that personally I owe thanks to the Government in that they have found it possible to embody in this Bill several of the recommendations of the Committee over which I presided. I differ very much from some of the remarks of my noble friend opposite, though I am bound to say that we were greatly indebted to him for his wise and experienced assistance on the Committee. He is probably second to none in this House for his knowledge of agriculture generally and the relations between landlord and tenant. I should like to point out to him that this Bill, in Clauses 1 and 4, which are the principal clauses, follows exactly the recommendations of the Committee. Indeed, Clause 4 is the <i>ipsissima verba</i> of the Committee's recommendation. Perhaps I may be allowed to read Paragraph 32 of the Committee's Report&#x2014;
<quote>"The majority of the witnesses were in favour of a longer notice to quit in all cases where the land is intended to be put, up for sale, and with a view, therefore, to mitigate the injury and possible
<col>942</col>
hardship inflicted at present on a tenant the Committee recommend that, in cases where a tenant receives notice to quit for the purpose of sale, the tenant should be empowered to serve a counter-notice churning that the notice to quit shall not take effect until one year after the original notice would have expired."</quote>
The Committee went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"The Committee think further that any question as whether or not a notice to quit has been given in connection with a sale or offering for sale should, in default of agreement, be referred by landlord or tenant at any time after the giving of notice to arbitration under the Agricultural Holdings Act. 1908."</quote>
I think any one who reads Clauses 1 and 4 of this Bill will see that they follow exactly these recommendations of the Committee.<lb/>
The reason for this extended notice is mainly the question of the Michaelmas tenants. If a man receives notice to quit at Michaelmas he has to go on in complete uncertainty until the sale takes place in the following May, June, or July, and in consequence of that uncertainty he cannot deal with his existing landlord and he cannot deal with the incoming landlord because he does not know who he will be, and after the sale is completed he then has only three months or so before the following Michaelmas, when the notice to quit takes effect, in order to look out for another farm. All that is proposed here is that he should have a further year. I do not think my noble friend can be right in saying that a landlord would postpone the sale in order to defeat this provision with regard to a counter-notice. The tenant would not give the counter-notice until the landlord had given him notice to quit. Therefore the landlord would have made up his mind to sell and probably would adhere to that although the tenant had given a counter-notice.<lb/>
I should like to reinforce my opinion by some of the best evidence we had before the Committee. Mr. Rawlence, of the firm of Messrs. Rawlence and Squarey, of Salisbury, surveyors and agents for the sale of estates, said [Q. 2297]&#x2014;
<quote>"I think under certain conditions a hardship is no doubt inflicted upon a tenant especially in the case of a Michaelmas tenancy. The sales do not generally take place until May, June, or July. We have to serve the tenant with notice at the previous Michaelmas. He does not know until after the sale takes place who his new landlord is to be, and then the purchase very often is not settled until the following Michaelmas. He either has to sit on and take his risks, or else directly the notice is given he must make up his mind to leave. I make the
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0497"/>
<col>943</col>
suggestion that where a sale takes place under these conditions the landlord should state in the notice for what purpose it was served; and provided the tenant has not at least six months after the completion of the purchase to negotiate with his new landlord, he should have the option of compelling the landlord to extend the one year's notice into two years' notice. This would give him plenty of time to negotiate with his new landlord."</quote>
Then he was asked&#x2014;
<quote><i>Q.</i>&#x2014;You think the landlord would be sufficiently protected if your suggestion was carried out?"</quote>
<quote><i>A.</i>&#x2014;Yes.</quote>
<quote><i>Q.</i>&#x2014;And you feel, knowing the circumstances in your part of the country, that that would meet all the difficulties?</quote>
<quote><i>A.</i>&#x2014;Yes, I should be satisfied with that.</quote>
Mr. Tindall, who represented the Surveyors' Institute, supported that solution. I will read the question [Q. 2581] and his answer&#x2014;
<quote><i>Q.</i>&#x2014;Mr. Rawlence put forward a solution which in his opinion would do good in the case of Michaelmas tenancies. He suggested that after the auction sale the tenant should be able to give a counter-notice to his landlord, in answer to his notice, that he (the tenant) would keep on another year, so as to give him time to look round to find another farm. Do you see any objection to that?</quote>
<quote><i>A.</i>&#x2014;I see no objection to that at, all.</quote>
I think your Lordships will agree that this is very strong evidence in support of the proposal in this Bill. I agree with Lord Clinton that tenants on large estates would prefer to remain under their present landlords, by whom they are so well treated, but in cases where estates are sold it will be a great relief to them to know that they can give a counter-notice and remain on their farms an additional year.<lb/>
On one point I cannot say that I am quite satisfied with this Bill. I cannot understand why my noble friend has omitted all allusion to the Committee's first recommendation, which seems to me an extremely harmless one. It could do no harm to any one, and I believe it would relieve considerable injustice. I refer to the recommendation that&#x2014;
<quote>"The period of notice of intention to claim compensation for disturbance under Section 11 of the Agricultural Holdings Act, 1908, should be amended."</quote>
What we say is this&#x2014;
<quote>"The Committee are of opinion that the provision in the Act with regard to the tenant's notice in writing of his intention to claim compensation is one that could be amended with advantage. At present a tenant is under an obligation to give such notice within two months of his receiving notice to quit or being refused a renewal. The Committee think that the early receipt by the
<col>944</col>
landlord from the tenant of notice of his intention to claim often has the effect of prejudicing the tenant in his negotiations with the landlord for a renewal. We are of opinion that the landlord would be sufficiently safeguarded if the tenant were allowed to give notice of his intention to claim at any time up to a date two months before the determination of the tenancy, and the Committee recommend that legislative steps should be taken to amend the Act accordingly."</quote>
The period stated in the Act of 1908 gives the tenant a very short time after receiving notice to quit in which to make his claim for compensation. We had evidence that these tenants do not very often employ a valuer at once, and of course they do not know until they do so what they ought to claim. There appears to be no reason whatever why the present period should have been put into the Act, and we think that if it were altered to two months before the expiration of the tenancy it would safeguard the landlord and be much more just to the tenant. In support of that view I would ask your Lordships to listen to an extract from the evidence of Mr. Rolleston, President of the Central Association of Agricultural and Tenant Eight Valuers&#x2014;
<quote><i>Q.</i>&#x2014;I think your associations are in favour of the time for a tenant claiming compensation being extended. At present he must give notice within two months of receiving notice to quit. How would it be if he were allowed to give notice of intention to claim compensation up to two months before he was turned out?</quote>
<quote><i>A.</i>&#x2014;A great number, I should think the majority, of members of our affiliated associations would favour a material extension of the time within which a tenant may give notice of his claim for compensation.</quote>
Mr. Vergette, principal of a firm of auctioneers and land agents at Peterborough, gave similar evidence&#x2014;
<quote><i>Q.</i>&#x2014;With regard to the notice for compensation, do you agree with Mr. Rolleston that it would be fairer to allow a tenant a longer time to put in his notice of claim for compensation?</quote>
<quote><i>A.</i>&#x2014;Yes, I do. I have often wondered how the present term came to be adopted. Many tenants do not consult a valuer until it is too late. I think the time should be fixed much nearer the end of the tenancy.</quote>
<quote><i>Q.</i>&#x2014;You think two months before ho has to quit the holding would be fair?</quote>
<quote><i>A.</i>&#x2014;Yes, I think that is sufficient.</quote>
<quote><i>Q.</i>&#x2014;You agree with Mr. Rolleston in that respect?</quote>
<quote><i>A.</i>&#x2014;Yes, two months before the end of the tenancy.</quote>
Mr. Cooper Coles, member of the Surveyors' Institute, said&#x2014;
<quote>"Under Section 11 of the Agricultural Holdings Act the tenant has to give notice of his claim for compensation within two months of receiving
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0498"/>
<col>945</col>
notice to quit. If there is any alteration in the Act I think it might fairly be extended so that the tenant could give notice within two or three months of the termination of the tenancy, instead of within two mouths of receiving notice to quit."</quote>
This was our first recommendation, and it was unanimously adopted by the Committee. I hope that my noble friend will see his way to include this in the Bill, or allow me to bring forward a clause in Committee to carry it out.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01982"><member>LORD HYLTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this Bill has been called by the noble Lord who brought it in a small Bill, and my noble friend Lord Clinton spoke of it as an insignificant Bill. But are your Lordships quite sure that it is so insignificant a measure as it appears to be? All agricultural tenancies throughout the kingdom will be affected, and considerably affected, by the clauses of this Bill; and, so far as I am concerned, if I can obtain any support on these Benches I shall do everything I can to prevent the Bill becoming law, at all events in its present form. And for more than one reason, with which I will venture to trouble your Lordships.<lb/>
This Bill, in the first place, only covers one point in the recommendations of the Departmental Committee over which Lord Haversham presided. His Majesty's Government have picked out one point in the recommendations of that Committee of which they happen to approve, and have thrown overboard those recommendations of which they do not approve. This is, I think your Lordships will agree, a. piecemeal and haphazard way of legislating, in view of the Report of an important Committee like that presided over by Lord Haversham. I oppose the Bill also because, while it can do little good to sitting tenants&#x2014;and in the opinion of my noble friend Lord Clinton it will do positive harm&#x2014;it may cause appreciable injury to landowners. The noble Lord the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Agriculture admitted that the Bill will, to a certain extent, act to the detriment of owners in selling their property, and he admitted that landowners in the case of a sale would have to give up something to their tenants. We all know that of late years considerably increased burdens have been placed on the landowners of this country. I will not refer to the seven burdens put upon land by the famous Budget of the present Chancellor of the
<col>946</col>
Exchequer, but now we learn from Lord Lucas that this Bill is to impose an eighth burden.<lb/>
Another argument against this Bill is that it is a fresh, uncalled for, and one-sided interference with contracts that have been freely entered into between landowners and tenants. It may be, in the opinion of some noble Lords, a small and insignificant measure, yet it is one more measure added to that interference with contracts which is tending every day to cause a greater feeling of insecurity and unrest in this country. As to the actual drafting of the Bill, I will only say a few words. Clause 2, as Lord Clinton pointed out, appears to have been drafted in a rather rapid and ill-considered way. If the noble Lord in charge of the Bill will look at Clause 1 he will see that the word "notice" in line 12 ought to read "counter-notice"; but these, perhaps, are points that can be better discussed in Committee if the Bill is read a second time.<lb/>
As regards the Report of Lord Haversham's Committee, after what the noble Lord has said to the House and after the lengthy debate which took place here on March 7, I need not detain your Lordships upon that. But you may, perhaps, remember that in that debate the Duke of Marlborough, in a very interesting speech, appealed in vain to His Majesty's Government to indicate to the House what was their general policy with regard to agriculture. The noble Duke got no response whatever from His Majesty's Government in regard to that appeal. All that we know is that His Majesty's Ministers approve of the breaking-up of large estates throughout the country. That being so, I should like to ask why they do not, in the agricultural measures that they bring in, try to facilitate in general the sale of land. The effect of this Bill, I venture to suggest, will be to retard instead of facilitating the movement favoured by the noble Marquess, Lord Lincolnshire, and others, of putting more persons on the land. As to the benefits that will result to sitting tenants under this Bill, if it is passed, I think they are very problematical. In the case of large estates sold <i>en bloc</i>, your Lordships are well aware that ninety-nine out of every hundred new purchasers are only too pleased to retain the tenants whom they find already on the land, and the advertisements of
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0499"/>
<col>947</col>
sales of landed estates which we see every day in the newspapers invariably contain a paragraph to the effect that the holdings are occupied by long established and respectable tenantry. Therefore this Bill would in no circumstances benefit the sitting tenants where an estate is sold in that way.<lb/>
The noble Lord in charge of this Bill admitted in the debate on March 7, and he has repeated the statement to-day, that the evidence given before Lord Haversham's Committee was to the effect that there were, as a matter of fact, under existing circumstances very few cases of hardship&#x2014;that the cases of hardship with which it is proposed to deal now were isolated and very rare. The noble Lord said something further in the debate on March 7. He then said that "hard cases made bad law"; and so the noble Lord on March 7 actually argued in advance against the Bill which he has brought in on May 7.</membercontribution></p>

To-day, however, he brings in a Bill to meet a few hard cases. Where these few hard cases may arise is, of course, in the case where an estate is sold in lots, where notice has been given to the sitting tenants by the vendor, and where the purchaser when the notice expires enters into occupation. That is one class of case. I venture to think that, from the point of view of the community and of agriculture at large, it is of advantage that there should be as many occupying owners as possible; and in these cases, even if there is a hardship on the tenant in being compelled to go out, his successor if he is an occupying owner is more likely to try and make two blades of grass grow where one grew before than any tenant however good a tenant he may be.<lb/>
But a phase of uncertainty must arise whether this Bill becomes law or not where the present condition of affairs continues, for until the auction takes place nobody knows whether the land will sell or not. The tenant in any case must go through a period of uncertainty. I have every
<col>948</col>
sympathy for such tenants, but surely there are two sides to this question, and I cannot help thinking that the landowner's point of view does merit some small&#x2014;it may be very small&#x2014;consideration. After all, an English landowner is in this position. He is not only the owner, for what that is worth, of the soil itself, but he is, in one sense of the word, a partner with his tenant in the occupation of the farm. English landowners provide the farm buildings, farm houses, cottages, and gates, and a considerable portion of the capital with which farming is conducted in this country is provided by the landowner. I do not say that the landowner's interest in these matters is as large as the tenant's. All I venture to say is that the landowner has some right to consideration, and I do not know that the noble Lord in charge of the Bill has made out any particular case why a new fraction should be taken away from the landlord and given to the tenant under this Bill.<lb/>
Where a contract has been entered into between both parties I have not yet been convinced that the noble Lord on behalf of His Majesty's Government made out a case why the contract is to be broken in favour of the tenant and is to be made a hard-and-fast one as regards the landlord. We have been told that contracts have been broken so often in legislation of late years that we have no right to use the breaking of contracts as an argument against a Bill. We had the Irish Land Acts quoted against us even by the noble and learned Earl on the Woolsack, who told us in a recent debate that we were not to mention the word "contract."</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01988"><member>LORD HYLTON</member><membercontribution>: All I ventured to say was that, after that statement of the noble and learned Earl. I was rather afraid of bringing forward the argument about the breaking of contracts. Lord St. Aldwyn, in alluding on March 7 to legislation on this subject, pointed out that if a measure of this kind became law it would be a considerable interference with the few remaining rights which landlords had over their property, and he very much questioned, I think, the advisability of legislation of this kind. It will be generally admitted that if this Bill is passed it will put a certain spoke in the wheel of land sales. It may not be a very formidable obstacle, but it will have a tendency to prevent sales going off as successfully as they have done, within the last year or two. And I say this, that His Majesty's Ministers have no right to do anything which will interfere with the facilities which exist for sales at the present time after the diatribes&#x2014;to quote the expression used by the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition&#x2014;that have been used by leading members of the Liberal Party against English landlords and the present system of land tenure in this country. It is because I think that this is a retrograde measure which will diminish instead of facilitating sales, because it appears to be a very ill-drafted and ill-digested measure that will do little good to tenants and appreciable harm to owners, and because it cannot benefit to any possible degree the agricultural community as a whole, that I shall do everything I can to prevent it finding its way on to the Statute-book in its present condition.<lb/>
One word on the question of the single arbitrator sent down by the Board of Agriculture and against whose decision there is no appeal. This single arbitrator was the creation of the noble Marquess, Lord Lincolnshire, and I wish to warn your Lordships against entrusting further powers to these Departmental inspectors from whose decision there is no appeal. Within the last twenty-four hours I happen, as trustee of a charity the surplus income of which is devoted to London hospitals, to have had brought to my attention a decision given by one of these arbitrators sent down by the Board of Agriculture. Sixty acres of this charity estate in Gloucestershire were taken by the county council for the purpose of small holdings. A very well known surveyor appointed on
<col>950</col>
behalf of this charity, whose name I am quite willing to give to the noble Lord in charge of the Bill if he desires it, valued the land at a rental of 40<i>s</i>. an acre, and was quite prepared not only to prove that land of a similar character adjoining it i was actually rented at 40<i>s</i>. an acre but was in demand at 40<i>s</i> an acre. Your Lordships will be surprised to hear that the arbitrator sent down by the Board of Agriculture decided that the land was to be in future rented by the county council at 17<i>s</i>. an acre. Thin is not a case where greedy landlords will suffer. It is the poor people in the London hospitals who will suffer, and I hope some inquiry will be made into this matter. I have only mentioned this case because I wish to warn your Lordships of what may take place if further powers are given, as is proposed in Clause 4 of this Bill, to single arbitrators against whose decision there is no appeal. I think this measure should receive ample consideration at your Lordships' hands before it is allowed to pass into law.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01989"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LINCOLNSHIRE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope your Lordships will permit me to say a few words on this subject, in which I naturally take very great interest. Lord Clinton, in putting the case as he always does in dear and temperate language, told us that he disliked the Bill because it was inadequate as an attempt to deal with a difficult question and tended further to do away with that security which existed before the present Government came into power. I will say a word upon that in a moment. Then he put a point which I think ought to be answered. He stated that if this Bill became law a landlord would have the power to postpone the sale for a year, so that the tenant would still have only three months in which to look round and get another farm. I do not think that any member of your Lordships' House would do such a thing as that. Whatever legislation is passed there are always ways of defeating it. You can, I believe, drive a coach-and-four through any Act of Parliament. But if such a thing as that were done, it seems to me on the spur of the moment and speaking entirely for myself&#x2014;for I am now able to indulge in one of those shrieks of liberty which people make when they are released from the cares of office&#x2014;that the best way to deal with it, if constantly done, would be by adding another year on to the period&#x2014;that is to
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0501"/>
<col>951</col>
say, give the tenant a further two years' tenancy instead of the one now proposed.<lb/>
Noble Lords opposite would, I suppose, say that it would be an outrage to propose such a thing, but I would like to remind the House what was the unanimous recommendation of the Welsh Land Commission which reported in 1896. And when I say the unanimous Report it must not be thought that it is the recommendation of hare-brained and half-cracked Liberal enthusiasts, for those who supported this recommendation included Lord Kenyon, Sir John Dillwyn Llewelyn, and Mr. Seebohm, who was well known as a great authority and a great friend of the late Lord Salisbury. The proposal of these three Conservative landowners was that in the case of the death of a landowner or the sale of an estate tenants should be protected by law in the occupation of their farms at the old rent for three years after such death or sale. The proposal in the Bill submitted to your Lordships to-day by my noble friend Lord Lucas is to give only one-third of the period recommended by that Commission a good many years ago.<lb/>
I was sorry to hear Lord Hylton state that he would do everything he could to prevent the Bill becoming law in its present form, and I was the more sorry to hear that remark come from a noble Lord who is so universally known and respected as a good landlord. I was pleased, however, when he went on to say that there was no evidence that not giving notice to quit interfered with the price that was given for estates when sold <i>en bloc.</i> But I know of many cases where members of your Lordships' House who have sold estates, not <i>en bloc</i> but in plots, have obtained just as good prices for their land though no notice to quit was given to their tenants as they would have done had they taken the arbitrary course which some landlords have adopted. I congratulate my noble friend in charge of this Bill on the necessity for its introduction. It shows that the present state of agriculture in England, after nearly seven years of Liberal government, is eminently satisfactory. Land, as we all know, is very readily let. If any one has a farm to let there are fifteen or twenty would-be tenants after it. The present condition of things reminds one of the good old times in the seventies, although, of course, it is not quite so good as at that time.
<col>952</col>
Landlords are tumbling over one another in all directions in their intense anxiety to unload their extra land upon the British public at very good and satisfactory prices. And here I join issue with the noble Lord opposite as regards extra taxation on agricultural land. I unhesitatingly deny that there has been any extra taxation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01990"><member>LORD HYLTON</member><membercontribution>: I said on land. I did not use the term agricultural land. I know what the noble Marquess is going I to refer to. He is going to mention the remission on agricultural land, but I find it very difficult to get that remission.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01991"><member>THE MAEQUESS OF LINCOLNSHIRE</member><membercontribution>:I will not say anything further on that point Clause 1 of this Bill provides that where the landlord of a holding, in connection with the sale or offering for sale of the holding or any part thereof, gives to the tenant notice to quit, the tenant may within two months after the receipt of that notice give to the landlord a counter-notice in writing claiming that the notice to quit shall not take effect until the expiration of one year from the date on which the notice to quit would otherwise have taken effect. I understand that there are two main objections to that provision. The first is that it is piecemeal legislation and only tinkering with the question. That objection recalls to me the case of a Liberal parson who declared himself to be in favour of Disestablishment and Disendowment, but when a Bill for the Disestablishment of the Church in Wales was brought forward some years ago I happened to meet him in the merry month of May when he was going to one of the celestial meetings and I said, "Of course,; you are going to vote for the Disestablishment and Disendowment of the Welsh: Church?" and he replied that he would I not vote for it because he was not in favour of piecemeal legislation. He went down i to Convocation and announced his in tention of voting against the measure, and of course his statement was received with rapturous applause by his clerical brethren. The noble Lord opposite has brought in King Charles's head in the shape of purchase. I do not propose to say anything upon that. If there was a debate on the subject of Tenancy <i>versus</i> Purchase I we should be able to hold our own, but it is irrelevant to the subject under discussion.<lb/>
The second objection to the Bill is voiced principally by Mr. Howard Frank, a personal
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0502"/>
<col>953</col>
friend of my own, who has sent a circular letter to members of your Lordships' House and who was courteous enough to send me one too. He says&#x2014;
<quote>"The Bill will not achieve the object. It only delays the evil. It is unfair to landlords and will do more harm than good to tenants."</quote>
I do not think that is the opinion of the tenant farmers of England as far as I understand it from their representative and mouthpiece, Mr. Colin Campbell, the Chairman of the Farmers' Union. I am not surprised at Mr. Frank's opposition. He is clever enough to seize his opportunity. He recognised that there was I a boom in land and he is rapidly making his fortune. He is an extremely shrewd, go ahead man, and he is, of course, trying to do the best he can for the noblemen and gentlemen who are entrusting their property to him for sale. He talks about the sanctity of contract, and so on. Every Agricultural Holdings Act interferes with the so-called sanctity of contract. Mr. Howard Prank's advice to landlords seems to be this&#x2014;"One of the two parties to the bargain must get the worst of it. Now do not let that one be yourselves."<lb/>
It seems to me that the whole situation is entirely reversed. We used to be told that tenant's right meant landlord's wrong. Now the situation, as far as I can understand it, is that if a landlord exercises his rights to their fullest extent he does in many cases a very hard and cruel wrong to his tenants. Mr. Frank quotes Paragraph 23 in the Report of Lord Haversham's Committee, in which they say that the landlord is within his rights in attempting to realise the capital value of his farm. Of course, he is. But have we never heard of a landlord pushing his rights too far? The landlord is no doubt within his rights in turning a tenant out of his holding at three months' notice. I have known a number of cases where notices to quit were given at Michaelmas and the sale did not take place till the end of June of the next year, yet the wretched tenants had to go out at the following Michaelmas. I have known that carried to a terrible extent, and in the case of one estate where large tracts of land were bought up by syndicates families whose representatives had been for 600 years on the land were turned out. Practically every day in England people are turned out with only three months' notice when land is put up for sale. Where on earth
<col>954</col>
is the tenant under present conditions to get another farm? The Government did what they could in the Compensation for Disturbance Bill, but in many cases the man is practically rained. I support this Bill because it will make such a cruel and wicked wrong as that practically impossible.<lb/>
Your Lordships are popularly supposed to own one-third of the land of Great Britain, and you occupy a very high and honourable position as regards the management of your landed estates. I do not mean for one moment to say that the House to which it is my pride and privilege to belong is extremely popular in all communities throughout the country, but I do say that, however much this House can be attacked far other reasons, no person can attack your Lordships as a body for not having treated your tenants well. You have this great record behind you. I respectfully ask your Lordships to live up to the great reputation which you have so deservedly won in that matter. This House has been willing to provide public money for land purchase. You have agreed that compensation should be paid to a farmer dispossessed for public purposes. Will you not welcome this, after all, very moderate Bill for the protection of the tenant farmers, for whom you have done so much in the past? The result of your sales may be slightly prejudiced. That is a matter of opinion. But those sales will almost invariably increase your already large incomes. You have claimed to be the farmer's friend in the past. I am bound to say&#x2014;and the farmers have not forgotten it&#x2014;that you fought the Land Tenure Bill, with its compensation clause, for all it was worth in the House of Commons and in this House, but you generously gave way in the end. You allowed the Bill to pass, and you sanctioned the principle of compensation to tenant farmers. Now my noble friend below me asks you to do a simple and not a very large act of justice to a hard-working, industrious and honourable body of men. If you are going to do it, as I hope you are&#x2014;the appearance of the House shows that there is no organised opposition to my noble friend's Bill&#x2014;would it not be a good thing to do it unanimously and graciously? You will then be able to claim to be the farmer's friend in truth and in reality. I earnestly hope that your Lordships will give to my noble friend's Bill the approbation it so richly deserves.</membercontribution></p>

He is admirably qualified to speak about security of tenure, for the insecurity in this country at present is caused by the noble Marquess's Small Holdings Act. There is not a tenant in England, whose holding is safe, and the noble Marquess knows that quite well. I must say it requires some effrontery on his part to lecture the House on security of tenure when the noble Marquess knows that he is unpopular with every farmer in England because of the insecurity that has resulted from his own Act. Those who go about the country and know what is being said about the noble Marquess and his policy are under no illusion, as he appears to be, as to the unpopularity of the Small Holdings Act.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01993"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LINCOLNSHIRE</member><membercontribution>: I never said that the Small Holdings Act was popular. What I said was that we ought to do justice to a deserving body of men. I did not mention the Small Holdings Act.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01994"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member><membercontribution>: I know the noble Marquess did not mention it, and that is the curious part. He wants justice done to all except that portion of this deserving body of men whom his Act deprives of security&#x2014;a far larger number of the tenants and farmers of England than have been affected by any action on the part of landlords for many years past. Not only is the security of the farmer affected by the noble Marquess's policy, but this arbitrator who is introduced into this Bill is the arbitrator who, as my noble friend Lord Hylton just now said, fixes 17<i>s</i>. an acre in respect of land valued by a valuer at 40<i>s</i>. an acre. The land in question was actually let at the time for 30<i>s</i>. It was not only valued as worth 40<i>s</i>. by the valuer, but was actually let at 30<i>s</i>. Yet this single arbitrator, from whose decision there is no appeal, fixed the rent at 17<i>s</i>. and some odd pence.<lb/>
The noble Marquess who spoke last and the noble Lord who moved the Second Reading of the Bill do not seem quite to agree as to whether or not the landlord will be injured by this Bill. I do think it was somewhat unfair on the part of the noble

Marquess who has just sat down to speak of the landlords of England unloading their superfluous land. I say nothing about your Lordships. We have been told that the members of this House own one-third of the land of Great Britain. I suppose you all roll in wealth! None of the land is encumbered! None of it is at all an anxiety to you! The noble Marquess knows perfectly Well that many landlords, the ordinary country squires of England, are greatly impoverished. He knows that heavy duties have been placed upon them, but he rides off upon the quibble that the extra taxation has not been upon agricultural land&#x2014;a remark unworthy of the noble Marquess. The landowners of England are bearing the heavy taxation which has been put upon them, and the moment they try to meet that heavy taxation by getting rid of land you speak contemptuously of unloading their superfluous acres, and so forth. Although Lord Lucas admits that the provision in this Bill will be a detriment to landowners, he thinks they will not suffer very much from it. The noble Lord said that the increased value of land was due to the tenants. I wish the noble Lord the next time he makes a speech on this subject would follow out that a bit. The value of your land is maintained by your tenant if he is a good one, but I have never heard that the value of the land under ordinary circumstances is increased. You might have a tenant who possibly increased the value of the land, but you might quite as often have a tenant who decreased its value. But to lay down as a general proposition that the increased value of land is due to the tenant I believe to be an economical fallacy.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01995"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: All I said was that the tenant was a contributor, and a very important contributor, to the increased value.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-01997"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord who has charge of this Bill introduced it to the House in terms of becoming modesty which go far to disarm our criticism. I thought that the tone of his observations was in agreeable contrast to the tone of some of the observations that proceeded later in the debate from the noble Marquess on the Back Bench opposite, with whose somewhat, i if I may be allowed to say so, superfluous admonition my noble friend the Duke of Northumberland dealt very appropriately a moment ago. The noble Lord in charge of the Bill told us very frankly that the Bill was not by any means in his opinion a sovereign remedy for the disease which we have to treat, and indeed I must say that, so far as I understand it, it appears to me to afford a very microscopic amount of alleviation to those sitting tenants for whom your Lordships' House entertain a very real feeling of sympathy. No one has been found to deny that those sitting tenants whose farms are, to use a convenient expression, sold over their heads, have a Teal and genuine grievance. Nor, I think, in spite of one or two things that have been said in the course of this discussion, will anybody seriously dispute that their hardships have been the result of the action taken by His Majesty's Government in their treatment of the land question. That is put beyond dispute if your Lordships recall what is said in the Report of Lord Haversham's Committee. You will see that in the seventh paragraph of that Report reference is made to the general feeling of apprehension which has been caused amongst landowners, and the Committee dwell upon the necessity of doing something to restore confidence. I do not think we need go beyond the finding of that very important Committee.<lb/>
During this debate we have been told again that these sales of land which are now proceeding at such a rapid pace are mainly, if not entirely, due to the desire of landowners to make a large profit by such transactions. That was assumed by the noble Lord who moved the Second Reading of the Bill, and the same proposition was advanced by the noble Marquess, Lord Lincolnshire. I think it quite possible that there have been some sales which have proved extremely advantageous to the sellers, but there have been a good many in which it would be idle to represent the transaction as a very profitable one.
<col>958</col>
Most of your Lordships who have watched these events must be aware of cases in which owners have been well content to take twenty-five years' purchase of the net rents&#x2014;that is, with proper deductions for landlords' expenditure, and so on&#x2014;as a reasonable price, and if you consider what twenty-five years' purchase of a rental with such deductions means, assuming that you invest the proceeds in trustee securities, you will see that the general result is very far from deserving the kind of description which has been given more than once by noble Lords opposite. There have, no doubt, been sales at a much higher figure, but what do they prove? They prove that in a great many cases the owners of the land have been content to let it at a figure very far indeed below the real market value which it could command. They have been ready to do so and would probably have still been ready to do so if it had not been for the disturbing causes to which I have referred. I was glad that the noble Duke commented upon the observation that we thought we heard Lord Lucas make, to the effect that, if there was a large margin of value, that margin was mainly attributable to the improvements executed by the tenant. The facts are perfectly notorious. There Was a tremendous fall of rents in what we commonly speak of as the bad times, and landlords very wisely and properly have not taken advantage of the improved demand for land in order to raise their rents prematurely to anything like the old figures, and for that reason no doubt in some cases there have been highly advantageous sales of land let below its value on liberally managed estates.<lb/>
As to the Bill, your Lordships will note that His Majesty's Government, having before them the Weighty Report of Lord Haversham's Committee, have brushed on one side entirely the main recommendation in that Report. The Committee's main recommendation was, of course, that these sitting tenants should receive assistance from the State in order to enable them to purchase their farms, and, as Lord Clinton truly said, these other minor recommendations were merely subsidiary recommendations to meet those cases in which the larger remedy of the Committee might prove not to be applicable. I have already ventured to speak upon this subject in your Lordships' House, and I will not repeat what I then
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0505"/>
<col>959</col>
said except to this extent, that I share with my noble friend his great regret that His Majesty's Government should not have seen their way to do something, at all events, to enable these sitting tenants to purchase their holdings. I do not for a moment desire to suggest that any large and indiscriminate scheme of land purchase such as that with which we are familiar in Ireland is applicable to this country. Nor do I suggest that any of the schemes which the Committee suggested is the best scheme for this purpose. But I should have liked to have seen the question taken up by His Majesty's Government, perhaps not in this session of Parliament, but taken up to this extent, that they would have shown a real desire to look into the matter, and, if possible, do something to afford a substantial remedy for the hardship which these people have to undergo.<lb/>
The Bill itself is, of course, based on the minor recommendations of Lord Haversham's Committee. One or two of the recommendations have, I think, been properly disregarded by His Majesty's Government. I think they were right in not accepting the suggestion of the Committee that there should be a universal notice of two years assumed in all cases where no contract of tenancy exists; and I am also glad, for reasons with which I will not trouble the House, that they did not accept the proposal that a tenant claiming for disturbance should be allowed I to postpone the date at which his claim might be put in. The Bill really deals; with two main points. There is the proposal in the second clause that there should in all cases be a minimum of twelve months notice to quit. That is the recommendation contained in the thirtieth paragraph of the Committee's Report, and a very proper exemption is made in the case of allotments. As to that proposal I have no comment to make. I think it one which your Lordships can well afford to accept. But I hope that we shall hear from whoever answers for His Majesty's Government that this change in the law will be made applicable to both parties, and not, as the language of the clause appears to suggest, to one of the parties only.<lb/>
The main proposal in the Bill is that contained in Clause 1, under which the tenant is allowed to serve a counter-notice upon his landlord. May I make one or two general observations that apply, I think, to all proposals of this kind?
<col>960</col>
I do not think we ought to allow our sympathy&#x2014;and it is a real sympathy&#x2014;with the sitting tenant to blind us to the fact that there are other interests to be considered besides his. There is the interest of the incoming tenant, which ought not to be left out of account. I think we may fairly say that the interest of the vendor ought not to be entirely ignored; and, apart from that, there is the question of the interests of the industry of agriculture. We ought not to do anything, it seems to me, which has a bad effect upon farming and tends to depreciate the productive power of the land. All these things ought to be considered, because it is frankly admitted by His Majesty's Government that this legislation is proposed, not in order to deal with a very large number of cases, but in order to meet a comparatively small number of hard cases of which they are aware. Another observation I venture to make in passing. I think we ought to remember that if the sitting tenant is only entitled to twelve months' notice to quit, that is his fault. There is not a tenant, I believe, who now holds under a yearly tenancy with a twelve months' notice who could not, if he chose to ask for one, get a lease from his landlord. That is a proposition which is established in the Report of the Committee; and I am very glad that it has been established, because we are all familiar with the speeches which are not infrequently delivered in which it is represented that the tenant farmers of this country spend their lives in a state of miserable insecurity, and, as it were, in a condition of servitude because they are denied any security of tenure. If landlords could get their tenants to take leases they would be delighted to let them have them, and that is a matter which should not be left altogether out of account. Then there is the question of the purchaser. The class of purchaser with whom we very often have to deal in these days is the small purchaser, and I believe both sides of the House are in agreement in desiring that these small purchases should be as frequent as possible. I am only saying what is notorious when I say that nothing deters the small purchaser so much as the knowledge that he will be kept waiting an indefinite time before he is allowed to obtain possession of that which he is buying.<lb/>
With regard to the effect of this clause, I do not think a clearer exposition could
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0506"/>
<col>961</col>
have been given to the House than that which we received from my noble friend Lord Clinton in the speech which he delivered earlier in this debate. Lord Clinton established clearly that under this clause a tenant will be entitled to the whole of the original year's notice to which he is at present entitled, <i>plus</i> what my noble friend described as the counter-notice year. That gives, it seems to me, a very long period of uncertainty and suspense, and a period of uncertainty and suspense which will not be very good for the farmer and probably not at all good for the farm. Then is it not the case, as my noble friend suggested, that in frequent cases the effect of this change in the law will be that the vendor will postpone the sale so that the sitting tenant, after all, will not be much better off than he is at present? All these seem to me to be questionable suggestions and to require a good deal of examination before your Lordships agree to accept the proposals which are made to us.<lb/>
And I am rather relieved at finding that I am not singular in that opinion. Since I came to the House this evening I have heard, upon what I believe to be excellent authority, that there has been held to-day a meeting of the Central Chamber of Agriculture, at which a considerable number of farmers were present. This Bill was under discussion, and I am told that no farmer was found to support it. I am told that the gentleman, a farmer himself, who moved the resolution dealing with the subject criticised the Bill of the Government as one detrimental to the interests of the tenant, disadvantageous to the landlord, and bad for the country from an agricultural point of view. I am told, further, that these opinions were endorsed by a number of leading men who were | present at the meeting. I trust that the noble Lord will make it his business to find out whether the farmers of this country will be really grateful for this Bill. I hope that time will be given to make such inquiries, and that His Majesty's Government will not commit the mistake of forcing the Bill upon the agriculturists of the country unless they really want it. That is all I desire to say. I certainly have no wish to impede the progress of the Bill at this stage. I am quite ready to vote for the Second Reading, but I think it more than likely that when we arrive at the Committee stage a good many noble
<col>962</col>
Lords will be found to offer practical suggestions for improving the Bill in matters of detail.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01998"><member>THE FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we who sit on this side of the House are very glad to think, not only from the concluding words of the noble Marquess but also from the general course of this debate, that your Lordships will be ready to give a Second Reading to this Bill to-day and proceed with the discussion of it during its subsequent stages. It is, indeed, refreshing to hear, for the second time within a short period, criticism passed upon a Government Bill on the ground that it does not go far enough. The noble Lord opposite, Lord Clinton, expressed the opinion that this Bill did not even touch the fringe of the subject, that it did nothing to alleviate the real difficulty. We all know what was in the mind of the noble Lord, who naturally wanted a scheme of purchase which he knows His Majesty's Government are not prepared to recommend the House to adopt. Having made up our minds not to adopt such a system, the question arose, What could we do? and we decided, following the recommendations of the Committee, to do something to mitigate the grievance from which, in our opinion, farmers certainly suffer. Unfortunately, the noble Lord damped our attempt by faint praise. The noble Lord on a former occasion spoke in terms of far higher praise of the provision which this Bill attempts to carry into law. On that occasion he used these words&#x2014;
<quote>"At the same time it will give a most important safeguard to the tenants themselves, that they will not be turned out at a moment's notice and without having sufficient time to find another farm."</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-01999"><member>LORD HYLTON</member><membercontribution>: I believe it would do so if the clause was properly drafted. But my point is that the Bill as it stands contains a great loophole for escape for a man who wants to sell with vacant possession.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02000"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: We are at tempting in this Bill to carry out what the noble Lord himself on a previous occasion said would be a most important safeguard in the interests of the tenant. We shall be very glad, I am sure, to have the assistance of the noble Lord in improving the drafting when we reach the Committee stage, and I hope the result will
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0507"/>
<col>963</col>
be a measure of which he will be able to approve as being properly drafted and at the same time as giving these tenants that very important safeguard.<lb/>
There were two matters, not of the first importance, referred to by the noble Lord to which I should like to give some answer. The first was as to the proviso to Clause 1, in the case of a holding purchased for the purpose of small holdings. I suppose that what was in the minds of the Committee when they considered this question was that some form of compensation should be given to the tenant. They did not at first know for certain whether it should be in the shape of longer notice or whether it should take the form of some money compensation, but in the end they thought that the granting of further time was the best method of giving compensation. But in the cases to which this special proviso refers compensation is already given under the Small Holdings and Allotments Act, and therefore unless this provision was inserted in the Bill there would be a double compensation not only of time but also of money. With regard to the insertion in Clause 2 of the words "by a landlord," my noble friend in charge of the Bill asks me to say that he regrets having misled the House in that matter. We shall be glad to consider any Amendment introduced on this point when we deal with the Bill in Committee.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Haversham was disappointed that we did not deal with the first recommendation of his Committee. I suppose that the criticism of the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition, who expressed his pleasure that we had not introduced legislation dealing with that matter, is a sufficient answer to the noble Lord behind me, and will show him how much more difficult the task of the Government would have been had we met his wishes and introduced such a clause in the present Bill. Lord Hylton criticised speakers on this side of the House on the point that they were not quite sure whether or not landlords would be injured by the operation of this Bill. May I say that in my opinion there will be no real injury to landlords, because this is an entirely modern practice which has grown up within a comparatively short time. It has not become a general practice, and we hope that after this Bill passes into law it will, even to the small extent to which it has obtained, disappear. As to the
<col>964</col>
noble Duke's criticisms, it is unnecessary for me to say anything in defence of the noble Marquess behind me. But may I put it in this form to the noble Duke? As I understand, when these squires of whom he spoke sell their land they have to pay exactly the same taxes and the same duties on the money they get for their land as before they sold it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02001"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member><membercontribution>: They have not to pay rates.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02002"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: That is calculated in the price they get for their land.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02003"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member><membercontribution>: That is just the question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02004"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: We shall be very glad to discuss that if the noble Duke will initiate a debate on the question of the incidence of rates upon land. I do not know that there is anything more to be said, because, generally speaking, the principle of the Bill at any rate is accepted by noble Lords opposite, who are going to give the Bill a Second Reading. We admit that except to tenant farmers this Bill may not be of great importance; but the Departmental Committee were persuaded by the evidence which was given before them that provisions such as the Bill contains would be of considerable importance to that class. Whether it is so or not, I think that your Lordships' House will be well advised in giving the tenant farmers that security of tenure for which they ask. If their fears are justified, there is a very real need for this Bill; but if, on the other hand, as some noble Lords opposite seem to think, there is no justification for their fears, His Majesty's Government have yet to learn that there would be any real injury if this Bill failed to act in the direction which we intend it should act. This Bill seems to me to illustrate once more the principle which His Majesty's Government have on more than one occasion tried to put into law&#x2014;that is, to try and make bad landlords act in the same way as good landlords do. Unfortunately, bad landlords do exist, and we know they give notices of this kind to their tenants in cases of sale. It is in order to prevent this that we have introduced this Bill, and I am glad to think that your Lordships intend giving it a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>

<title>SPECIAL RESERVE OFFICERS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02006"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member> had the following Notice on the Paper&#x2014;"To call attention to the deficiency of subaltern officers in the Special Infantry Reserve; and to ask the Secretary of State for War whether he is satisfied with the recruiting of Special Reserve Infantry officers."</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02007">The noble Duke said: My Lords, in considering questions connected with the Special Reserve we must remember that our military forces have been reorganised in two lines, and that the Special Reserve is an essential and an important part of our first line. I am dealing only with the deficiency of Special Reserve subalterns. The establishment of Special Reserve subalterns for all battalions is 1,915. On February 1, 1912, the total number serving was 697, and the shortage 1,218. The establishment of officers as well as their duties being different for the Third and Fourth Battalions, it is better to consider the state of these battalions separately. This is easily done by means of the Army List. I take the Third Battalions first. The establishment of Special Reserve subalterns for the 74 Third Battalions is 1,402, and the strength by the Army List of last March was 510 Special Reserve subalterns&#x2014;a deficiency of 892. The noble Viscount is committed by his plan to send on mobilisation 370 Special Reserve subalterns from the Third Battalions to the Line Battalions and to the dep&#x00F4;ts. He has thus available for battalion duties 140 Special Reserve subalterns for 74 battalions. This is less than two subalterns per battalion, and not one-tenth of the total number required for battalion duties.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02008">As regards the 27 Fourth Battalions, the establishment for subalterns is 513; the strength is 168; therefore the deficiency is 345. By Appendix VI of the Army Order of December 23, 1907, each of these 27 battalions has to send on mobilisation four subalterns to the Regular battalions. The noble Viscount stated on March 6 last that&#x2014;
<quote>"allowance had been made in their establishment to admit of four subalterns per battalion passing to the Regulars on mobilisation."</quote>
Now, as the noble Viscount has told us that allowance had been made in the number of the establishment to cover the transfer of four subalterns to the Line,
<col>966</col>
presumably enough would be left to carry on battalion duties. As a matter of fact, if 108 subalterns are to go to the Line on mobilisation, then 60 subalterns will be left for the 27 battalions&#x2014;that is, two subalterns per battalion. At the beginning of the year, by the January Army List, there was only one out of the 27 Fourth Battalions with less than 10 Special Reserve officers deficient. One of these Fourth Battalions was 22 officers deficient&#x2014;that is to say, it had seven officers when by its establishment it ought to have had 2ft Special Reserve officers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02009">The one great change which was to make the Fourth Battalions Special Reserve when reorganised by the noble Viscount as first line troops so superior to their former selves when second line troops, was the presence of four Regular officers per battalion in addition to the Adjutant. In 1910 a Return was rendered [Cd. 5018] showing that all the Regular officers, 108 in number, were doing duty with these Fourth Battalions. The Return thus proclaimed the perfection of the noble Viscount's plan. But it did not last long. On February 27, 1911, appeared an Army Order under which the 108 Regular officers were all to be reposted to their Regular units. I noticed by the November Army List that there were no Regular officers serving with the Fourth Battalions except the Adjutants and Quartermasters. We see, then, that as regards the Regular officers in these Fourth Battalions the plan has collapsed. The Regular officers are not there, because the noble Viscount has not got them to spare. It is certain from the Army List that as far as officers from the Special Reserve Infantry are concerned, the noble Viscount's plan will not work. On the mobilisation of the Infantry of the Special Reserve the noble Viscount has only one officer for both Third and Fourth Battalions where he ought to have ten. Now. it is obvious that one officer cannot do the work of ten, and that we have here a certain breakdown in a matter of first line mobilisation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02010">I pass from the question of numbers to that of training. We were told, when the Special Reserve was created, that officers of the Special Reserve Infantry were to do one year of continuous training with the Line battalion before joining the Special Reserve battalions. This training was to
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0509"/>
<col>967</col>
qualify them for employment as first line officers. However, it soon became apparent that on those terms officers were not forthcoming, so an Army Order appeared on February 27, 1911, which completely altered the original conditions. At present nearly all officers in the Special Reserve come from the Officers Training Corps. They do so because they prefer to enter the Army by a door which is purposely made easy in order to encourage the Officers Training Corps, rather than by ways which in comparison are made more difficult. If they are in possession of the necessary certificates from the Officers Training Corps then they do a three months' course which may be divided into two separate periods of six weeks each. That is a very different matter from a continuous year of training in the Regular Army. This preliminary training may be done with any Line battalion, after which the officer trains annually with his own battalion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02011">In addition, a Supplementary List has also been established. I quote from the Army Order of February 27, 1911&#x2014;
<quote>"It has been decided to allow Special Reserve officers to join Infantry regiments on a Supplementary List without being posted in peace to any particular battalion. These officers will train annually for fourteen days at any time which may suit their convenience. This training will be carried out with a Regular or Reserve unit."</quote>
Officers on this list do the same preliminary training. The difference is that they need not train with their battalions, and that their annual training is two Weeks and not four weeks. The object of this plan is to allow them the liberty of choosing the time and place most convenient to themselves for their annual military outing. It was hoped that this go-as-you-please, train-when-you-like, unattached plan would prove a greater attraction than joining a battalion of the Special Reserve and having to do a four weeks' training instead of two weeks, and that at a time and at a place and under a commanding officer not chosen by the subaltern himself. It is certain that if the unattached subaltern has any reason to find fault with his commanding officer during his two weeks' experience of him he will not train under him again, but choose another in preference. On mobilisation these officers from the Supplementary List will be posted to battalions they may or may not have
<col>968</col>
seen before, and commence for the first time their duties as regimental officers, because they have not previously belonged to any regiment. There is all the difference in the world between belonging to a regiment and belonging to none but being attached first to one regiment and then another, according to your own fancy, for a fortnight a year. When officers are attached to regiments for a couple of weeks' instruction they cannot be allowed to administer discipline. It would be grossly unfair on the men of the Regular Army that they should be constantly punished by cadets absolutely ignorant of the meaning of what they are doing. So these officers on the Supplementary List will join on mobilisation&#x2014;that is, at the moment when they are to proceed on active service&#x2014;without any knowledge of how they ought to treat their men or how they ought to maintain discipline; indeed, they have no idea what the discipline of the Regular Army means, because they have never been through the mill. It is preposterous to assume that officers trained in this fashion will be fit for first line duties with the battalions of the Expeditionary Force. The number shown in the Army List of these Supplementary officers is 34. We have only two lines, and Special Reserve officers are first line officers. Therefore unless trained for the first line duties which they are to perform in war there must be disaster. You can expect nothing else.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02012">As regards training, we see that under the Army Order of February 27, 1911, all attempts at elementary first line training for the Special Reserve officers have been definitely abandoned. No doubt this sacrifice of quality was made in the hope of securing increased quantity. On March 1, 1909, the noble Viscount was asked whether he was satisfied with the recruiting of Special Reserve officers. He replied&#x2014;
<quote>"Yes; because I am not wholly dependent upon the officers of the old class. I am depending upon contingents from the new Officers Training Corps, the fruits of which will begin to be seen in the summer."</quote>
The noble Viscount then expected to gather his first crop in the summer of 1909. But a year after&#x2014;on March 8, 1910&#x2014;the noble Viscount was again asked whether he expected that the shortage in Special Reserve officers would be met by supplies
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0510"/>
<col>969</col>
from the Officers Training Corps. The noble Viscount replied&#x2014;
<quote>"The Officers Training Corps has been in existence only a little more than a year, and we have not yet Been its fruit. Those who take commissions in the Special Reserve of Officers will remain there on an average about ten years. If you bring in 1,000 a year, you would thus get 10,000, and when you have once got a considerable establishment the wastage in that establishment will not be so serious. The Officers Training Corps must be judged by what it will produce, and not by what it is in the present year."</quote>
Well, the summer of 1909, which was to have produced the first harvest, had then come and gone, and now that of 1010 and that of 1911 have passed and we are well on in 1912. But what has happened? From the formation of the Officers Training Corps in 1908 up to February 1, 1912, by the statement of the Under-Secretary of State for War on February 20 last, 241 members have been appointed to the Special Reserve, all arms.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02013">The noble Viscount hoped to gather his first fruits in 1909, but his crop failed; nevertheless, in 1910 he hoped he would bring in 1,000 a year from the Officers Training Corps, but since its formation he has brought in 241. Then he told us that officers would serve for ten years in the Special Reserve, but it seems that out of the 241 who joined during the last two years 219 announced their intention of passing into the Army as soon as possible. According to the noble Viscount's statement of March 8, 1910, 3,000 subalterns ought to have now joined the Special Reserve from the Officers Training Corps, but it seems that only 241 have done so. Out of this number 217 have either joined or are about to join the Army. This gives an actual permanent intake of 24, instead of the estimated 3,000. Surely if you reckon on having 3,000 officers and you find on mobilisation that you have 24 it is apt to be inconvenient, especially in your first line. I can only repeat the question asked in 1909 and again in 1910. Is the noble Viscount still satisfied with the recruiting of officers for the Special Reserve by means of the Officers Training Corps? Does he still think that he will obtain 1,000 officers per annum from this source, and that they will remain in the Special Reserve for ten years? If so, when will the intake of 1,000 a year commence? And, meantime, what would be our position as regards Special Reserve officers if we were called upon to mobilise next year?</p>
<col>970</col>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02014"><sup>*</sup><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOE WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Duke has opened a formidable battery of figures, and I do not profess to be in a position to be able to deal with all that he has poured out, but there are some points with which I can deal now without further notice. I agree with the noble Duke that the question of the supply of subaltern officers for the Special Reserve&#x2014;there is no difficulty about the senior officers&#x2014;is a very serious one, and I also agree with him that the operation of the Officers Training Corps is a matter which wants close watching.<lb/>
The Officers Training Corps has now been in operation since 1908, and it is interesting to see what has been the growth of candidates for the Special Reserve during that time. The Officers Training Corps is now beginning to give its fruits. I take the figures of candidates appointed to the Special Reserve since September, 1908, when we practically began. The figures I which I give do not relate solely to those I who have come in from the Officers Training Corps, but that corps furnishes increasingly the main sources of supply. About fifty per cent, of those taking commissions as subalterns in the Special Reserve come from the Officers Training Corps, and the percentage is an increasing one. In 1908&#x2014;we did not practically begin until the month of September of that year&#x2014;we only got thirty-seven subaltern officers for the Special Reserve, of whom very few came from the Officers Training Corps. But in 1909 that corps began to tell, and we got a total of subaltern officers, including those who came from the Officers Training Corps, of 204; in 1910 the figure rose to 253; and in 1911, to 261.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02015"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member><membercontribution>: Were those for Infantry only, or for all arms?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-02018"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: I have not got in detail month by month the figures of the Infantry only.

<image src="S5LV0011P0I0511"/>
<col>971</col>
Special Reserve. That being so, the estimate of Sir Edward Ward's Committee, on which the Officers Training Corps was based, that 2,000 officers would be obtained from all sources in eight years will probably be substantially exceeded. Therefore I do not think the situation so far as regards the Officers Training Corps is at all bad. The noble Duke spoke only of Infantry, but we cannot look only at Infantry; and I think that in looking at the Infantry he left out of account the Unattached List, which is becoming an increasing feature of the Special Reserve.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02019"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member><membercontribution>: I mentioned that according to the Army List there were 34 of these supplementary officers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02020"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: The Infantry on the Supplementary List are now growing up for the first time, but they are growing up. The noble Duke will remember what the Supplementary List was, and the reason for its being brought into existence. It was found that a great many young men at the Universities and in professions could not come out in May and June with the Special Reserve, so opportunity was given them of training instead with Regular battalions, which they could do in September, their places during the training of the Special Reserve being taken by Regular officers whom they relieved later on. If the noble Duke will look at a Special Reserve Brigade such as may be seen out in the summer time on such places as Salisbury Plain, he will see that a large number of the officers there are Regulars who have come in for that purpose and who will be relieved of work later on by those on the Unattached List. For instance, I see that the establishment of Special Reserve officers is 2,707&#x2014;I am taking the figures of April 1 last&#x2014;the strength in units is 1,504, and there are 46 unattached. The number of those unattached is increasing. Officers are coming in through the Officers Training Corps on the Unattached List with greater rapidity than was the case before, and the rate of progress I gave from the other figures applies to the Infantry just as much as to the other arms.<lb/>
As I have said, I agree with the noble Duke that the question of officers for the Special Reserve is a very important one, but I see no reason to be depressed. The Officers Training Corps is answering its
<col>972</col>
purpose; it is sending in officers as rapidly as we anticipated. The estimate of the Ward Committee, that there would be 2,000 officers in eight years from all sources, is likely to be exceeded. The Officers Training Corps is very popular, and is furnishing us with the class of officer we want. We have reason to think that the opening of the Unattached List will increase the process of accretion. And if it is said that there is still a shortage, my comment is that there was a shortage before. The shortage that existed in the days of the Militia was assuming formidable proportions, and, unless we had taken the steps which we have taken to check it would have assumed really dangerous proportions. The fact is that the class which furnished subaltern officers to the Militia is a class which has ceased to exist. The younger sons of the landed gentry now, not unnaturally, are no longer content with the easy going lot which contented them in years gone by. They now go into the city and into every kind of business; they like to make money and are no longer satisfied to stay at home and do odd jobs and train the Militia. The result was that long before these changes were made the class of subaltern officer in the Militia had begun to fall off rapidly. The only thing to do was to turn to new sources. We turned to the Officers Training Corps, and that corps is giving every indication that it will supply the deficiency which exists.</membercontribution></p>

Though no one in your Lordships' House admires more than I do the energy which the noble Viscount has devoted to the War Office, I do think, if I may venture to say so, that the sort of optimism with which he views the present serious state of things i does not really tend to encourage confidence among the public.</membercontribution></p>

The noble Viscount stated that he had not furnished himself with the full figures; yet the noble Duke stated in his Notice in Very distinct terms that he wished to ask for information as to the strength of subaltern officers in the Special Infantry Reserve. I do not think that in his answer the noble Viscount impugned the really serious state of things which my noble friend explained to the House. What was the noble Duke's statement? The noble Duke stated that the Special Reserve, both Third and Fourth Battalions, had an average of only two subalterns per battalion. That is so, I think?</membercontribution></p>

that on mobilisation there will be only two subalterns on the average in each Special Reserve battalion. Every one knows that it would be quite impossible to work a battalion with only two subalterns.

<p id="S5LV0011P0-02031"><member>THE MARQUESS OP SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: There was an optimistic vagueness about the noble Viscount's answer. He did not wish to emphasise too severely the deficiency which exists even in the case of the Officers Training Corps. Speaking from my own experience, I can only say that I have been successful in getting very few officers from the Officers Training Corps. I do not know whether other commanding officers have been more fortunate. The noble Viscount would gain by taking the country into his confidence and telling us whether the experiments which he has tried are successful or not. Unless something can be done to increase the number of officers in the Regular Army and certainly in the Special Reserve there will be a serious situation, and the noble Viscount and his colleagues will have to consider whether improved conditions of service will not have to be offered. For officers they must have. I am sure the noble Viscount will be the first to admit that unless he can get officers by the methods which he has at present adopted he must find other methods. I invite the noble Viscount, not only to face these very difficult questions in his office, but to face them in your Lordships' House, and not allow the optimism of which he is so proud to prevent him telling the House and the country the exact position.</membercontribution></p>

<title>SPECIAL RESERVE OFFICERS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02073"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member> rose to call attention to&#x2014;
<ol><li>1. The statement of the Secretary of State for War on 8th March, 1910: "Those who take commissions in the Special Reserve of Officers will remain on an average about ten years. If you bring in 1,000 a year you would thus get 10,000, and when you have once got a considerable establishment the wastage in that establishment will not be so serious."</li>
<li>2. The answer of the Under-Secretary of State for War on 20th February, 1912, who, when asked the number of officers from the Officers Training Corps who have joined the Special Reserve up to 1st February, 1912, replied that "during the last two years 217 subalterns on joining declared their intention of presenting themselves for commissions, and some have already passed into the Regular Army. Up to the 1st February 241 members of the Officers Training Corps have been appointed to commissions in the Special Reserve."</li></ol></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02074">To ask if it is not the fact that&#x2014;
<quote><b>1.</b>&#x2014;(<i>a</i>) The number of Special Reserve subalterns serving in the 74 Third Battalions by the Army List of last March was 510.</quote>
<quote>(<i>b</i>) That the number required by Appendix V of Army Order of 23rd December, 1907, to pass to the Dep&#x00F4;ts and to the Line battalions on mobilisation is 370.</quote>
<col>982</col>
<quote>(<i>c</i>) That 510 less 370 leaves 140 Special Reserve subalterns available on mobilisation for battalion duties with the 74 battalions&#x2014;in round numbers, two subalterns per battalion.</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02075">2. That in the case of the Fourth Battalions&#x2014;
<ol><li>(<i>a</i>) The number of Special Reserve subalterns by the Army List of March last was 168.</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) That the number required by Appendix VI of Army Order of 23rd December, 1907, to pass to the Line battalion on mobilisation is four from each battalion, a total of 108, leaving 60 subalterns available for battalion duties with 27 battalions&#x2014;in round numbers, two subalterns per battalion.</li></ol></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02076">3. That the number of Special Reserve Infantry subalterns on the Supplementary List is shown in the Army List for April to be 34.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02077">The noble Duke said: My Lords, the Questions standing in my name on the Paper arise from the discussion which took place in your Lordships' House last week. I now call attention to the statement of the Secretary of State for War, made two years ago, which is the estimate that the noble Viscount made of the probable number of officers who would join the Special Reserve from the Officers Training Corps. Then I call attention to the statement of the Undersecretary of State for War in February of this year, which gives the result of the two years' working. The estimate and the results are widely different. Last week, as far as I could follow the noble Viscount's figures, he told us that from September, 1908, to April, 1912, 867 officers had joined the Special Reserve from the Officers Training Corps. But on March 6 the noble Viscount told us that since the formation of the Officers Training Corps 283 officers had joined the Special Reserve. It is really quite impossible to follow the noble Viscount's figures on this point. The Army List, however, will tell us whether the noble Viscount's plan is going to be a success or not. In the Army List we find the exact number of Special Reserve officers now serving in the Special Reserve Infantry. Then arises the question, Is
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0517"/>
<col>983</col>
that number adequate or not? I maintained last week that the number is wholly inadequate, and I have put on the Paper in detail to-day figures which show that on mobilisation the noble Viscount will find himself with two subaltern officers for every Special Reserve Infantry battalion. Last week the noble Viscount was not able to accept that figure; indeed he dissented from it altogether. I have now put down the calculation in detail, and I beg to again bring the matter to the notice of the noble Viscount by asking the Questions standing in my name.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02078"><sup>*</sup><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOE WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Duke begins by complaining that the Officers Training Corps has not produced more officers within the time during which it has been in existence. Seeing that it was not possible for anybody to get the "B" certificate until a little over two years ago, I do not think that complaint is very reasonable. I will give the figures of what the Officers Training Corps is producing, and it is producing up to expectations. As regards the noble Duke's general observation, I do not think I said that the 867 officers were for the Special Reserve. If that statement appeared, then I was misreported. I meant, and I think I said, that that number was the number of those who had taken commissions. But I will give the figures upon that in a moment.<lb/>
There are two general observations which I wish to make before I answer the noble Duke's Questions. The first is that I think it very inexpedient to discuss mobilisation arrangements in a public fashion more than is necessary. I have gone to the utmost limit in what I am going to give to the noble Duke to-day. The noble Duke is quite entitled, of course, to challenge figures which have been publicly given and to ask for explanations of them, but I do not think it is quite right that he should debate them. Whilst we do not desire to put before the world our mobilisation arrangements, which have been made and are being made with great care, we are quite ready to give information. We have nothing we wish to conceal; and if the noble Duke or any other noble Lord chooses to call at the War Office and see the Adjutant-General&#x2014;or myself, if he prefers it, though I think it is better that lie should get the
<col>984</col>
information from the officer responsible&#x2014;he will get information of a more full description than it is possible to give across the Table of the House.<lb/>
My second observation is this. The machinery which has been called into existence may be working slowly&#x2014;I never expected that it would work rapidly&#x2014;but at any rate it is better than no machinery at all. We used to have no machinery for supplying this deficiency. During the South African War we got officers where we could, and some very excellent officers we did get, who did much better than those would have expected who lay stress upon the absence of training and considerations of that kind. But we have now got, not only the Officers Training Corps, but other arrangements which supply us with a pretty well assured prospect of being able to mobilise the Expeditionary Force and the rest of the Army much more easily than when we had no such machinery. And when you pass to the question of mobilisation generally, I repeat what I said before. Mobilisation for war is for every Power a ragged business. We have our peace establishment of Regular officers. There is practically no deficiency there. But when we pass to mobilisation we want a great many more officers. So does every other Power in the world. In France they mobilise largely with non-commissioned officers. Wellington mobilised with non-commissioned officers. We ourselves did not use non-commissioned officers at the time of the South African War, but we have used them on other occasions. Germany, through her compulsory service system, has a supply of Reserve officers which enables her to be more independent than other Powers. But no Power that I know of keeps a peace establishment of officers which would be sufficient on mobilisation in time of war.<lb/>
I will now give the noble Duke the answers to his Questions, and I may say that the statement which I am going to read has been carefully prepared by the Military Secretary and the Director of Military Training, Sir Archibald Murray, in consultation with myself, and it has been revised by the Adjutant-General, and it goes to the utmost limit of the information which, in the public interest,
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0518"/>
<col>985</col>
we are prepared to give. If the noble Duke wants more information, I repeat that we shall be pleased to give it to him privately. The figures given by the noble Duke in his Questions are approximately correct, except as regards (<i>b</i>) in the second Question. That is the reference to the number required by Appendix VI of the Army Order of December 23, 1907, to pass to the Line battalion on mobilisation. The noble Duke refers there to the Fourth or Extra Reserve battalions, and it is not his fault that he has been misled. It is true that the Appendix he quoted lays down that four subalterns from each Extra Special Reserve or Fourth Battalion will join Regular battalions on mobilisation. That was originally intended and stated, and the noble Duke is quite entitled to refer to the statement. But in the course of the later developments of the mobilisation scheme this has ceased to be so, and these Fourth Battalions do not now have to part with any subalterns on mobilisation.<lb/>
With regard to the statement I made on March 8, 1910, which is quoted by the noble Duke, I should like to explain that it had reference to the productiveness of the Officers Training Corps when it should have reached its full effect. That it could not do until 1914 at the earliest. The organisation has only been working a couple of years and is still in its early days. I prefaced my statement by saying that&#x2014;
<quote>"The Officers Training Corps having boon in existence only a little more than a year, we had not yet seen its fruit."</quote>
The basis of the Officers Training Corps organisation is that its members should obtain certificates "A" and "B," the concessions granted in respect of which would facilitate their taking Special Reserve commissions. Since the chief condition underlying the grant of these certificates is a period of four years' service in the Officers Training Corps, it follows that no considerable results can be looked for in the way of Special Reserve commissions up to the present. The figure given as to the actual number of commissions taken in the Special Reserve from the Officers Training Corps up to February 1, 1912, is substantially correct; but, as I have said, the full effect of the creation of that corps is not expected for another two years.<lb/>
<col>986</col>
It is instructive, however, to notice the progress that the Officers Training Corps has made so far. In 1909 122 officers joined the infantry of the Special Reserve, of whom three came from the Officers Training Corps; in 1910 the figures were 168 and 48 respectively; in 1911 they were 199 and 107; and during the present year 92 officers have joined the Special Reserve, of whom 47 came from the Officers Training Corps. It will thus be seen that there 1ms been a steady increase in the numbers who have joined the Special Reserve, and that during the last sixteen months fifty per cent. of them have been provided by the Officers Training Corps. It seems unreasonable to judge an organisation by its output at some particular date when the productiveness o of that organisation has been shown to make a steady increase with every year i of its existence. It is true that a large proportion of those who have hitherto joined the Special Reserve of Officers endeavour to obtain Regular Army commissions, and that some of them are successful. But as they have to serve in the Special Reserve for a period of at least eighteen months before they can obtain Regular commissions, they are available during that time for the purpose that the Special Reserve of Officers is intended to fulfil&#x2014;namely, to take their places in a Regular or Reserve unit on mobilisation. That is an extra asset which the noble Duke has not taken into account.<lb/>
The steps that will be taken to provide officers for Special Reserve units in the event of mobilisation being ordered before the full output has been obtained from the Officers Training Corps have been fully considered. In completing the requirements of the Expeditionary Force as regards officers it has been found necessary to draw upon four sources&#x2014;(1) non-commissioned ranks; (2) Special Reserve units; (3) Supplementary Reserve; (4) General Reserve. Investigation has shown that it is possible from these four sources to meet all the initial requirements, both Staff and Regimental, of the Expeditionary Force of six Divisions on mobilisation. The next step is to complete the diminished <i>cadres</i> of the Special Reserve units, and to make them up to an establishment sufficient to ensure the easy reinforcement of the Expeditionary Force with efficient officers and the constant
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0519"/>
<col>987</col>
and efficient training of the men so long as they remain in England. In the first place, there will always be a certain number of Regular non-commissioned officers who during their service have been recommended by their commanding officers as suitable to receive commissions on mobilisation and have taken their discharge, either compulsorily or voluntarily, before any national emergency has arisen. These men will be useful for work in the subaltern ranks of the Special Reserve, and a register is being opened to ensure their being obtainable when required. Any Supplementary Special Reserve officers who are not required for service with the Regular units will join Special Reserve units. It is also proposed, as in the case of Regular battalions, to grant commissions in the Special Reserve to a certain number of non-commissioned officers serving in those battalions on the Permanent Staff. That is, of course, Regular non-commissioned officers. It will be seen, however, that a good deal of reliance must be placed on the General Reserve and other units for the completion of the Special Reserve units.<lb/>
It has been calculated that when the Expeditionary Force leave these shores complete in every particular as regards officers, there will be an initial deficiency in the Infantry Special Reserve units of about 1,100 subalterns. This is partly due to the number of officers we shall take from the Special Reserve for Regular battalions, and in this connection it may be pointed out that the Special Reserve subalterns that we have are a much more valuable asset to the Army as a whole than the Militia subalterns used to be, as the latter were not liable for service abroad. In fact, if we were not able to utilise the Special Reserve officers it is difficult to see how the additional subalterns for the Regular battalions on mobilisation could conveniently be provided. All the Regular officers belonging to the Special Reserve establishment in peace will remain with them on mobilisation, so that we are certain of having a good nucleus of teachers before the unit is made up of mere numbers. On mobilisation the companies of these Special Reserve units&#x2014;I am speaking of the 74 Third Battalions&#x2014;hange very much. They get filled up with men who have not attained the age of twenty and are too young to go abroad and with surplus Reservists, a large number of
<col>988</col>
whom would be new to the unit. The unit would not be one in which the officers would know their men or the men their officers. That is inherent, and it therefore makes less difference that fresh officers are coming in. It must be quite understood that the Expeditionary Force makes no demand upon, and is not granted the services of, the Regular officers attached to Special Reserve battalions. Neither can it in any way draw upon the services of any of the officers of the 27 Special Reserve units who do not act as mere training schools during war.<lb/>
There are at the present moment 124 Infantry subalterns on the General Reserve. Of these, however, some are known not to be available on mobilisation, but steps are being taken to purge the General Reserve of Officers of all useless members. Efforts are at the same time being made to fill their places by calling upon the members of the Officers Training Corps who have not found themselves in a position to take commissions in the Special Reserve. When a member of the Officers Training Corps reaches a certain age he decides whether his future work and his present circumstances admit of his accepting a commission in the Special Reserve or Territorial Force. If he finds that he is not able to do so owing to the calls upon his time made by the preliminary and annual training, he is approached with a view of ascertaining whether he is willing to accept a commission in the General Reserve. These commissions carry no obligation for annual training, and simply mean that he registers his name as liable to be called out on emergency, when he will form part of the officers' <i>cadre</i> of the Special Reserve units. While he is attached to these during mobilisation he will take up the training again which he dropped on leaving his school or University. Although there has not been intermediate training, that class of officer is a great deal better than the class of officer who was found useful in the South African War.<lb/>
The present strength of the Officers Training Corps is nearly 25,000, and about 18,000 have left the corps after receiving a certain amount of military instruction, and it is considered that many of these may be willing to join the General Reserve. Besides these sources from which officers can be drawn for the Special Reserve units, there remain the training colleges. The
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0520"/>
<col>989</col>
senior division at Sandhurst, consisting of about 200 cadets, will be available at once, and possibly the cadets in the junior division, especially if the Sandhurst course is lengthened, might also be taken. But as all these cadets will be only half trained in a military sense they will not be used for the Expeditionary Force, but will be sent to help to complete the establishment of the Special Reserve units.<lb/>
I have now gone through the different sources from which officers can be obtained in the case of a national emergency, but it must be borne in mind that the deficiency we are contemplating will only exist after all the Regular battalions have been brought up to war strength and all their seconded officers have been replaced. If we grant commissions to three noncommissioned officers per battalion and draft all Sandhurst cadets who have completed six months' training to the Special Reserve, we should obtain, roughly, 600 subalterns from these two sources alone; and if we also take into consideration the other sources of supply alluded to, notably the retired non-commissioned officer class, which will prove in time a fruitful source, it will be seen that material exists from which the deficiencies can be made good when the time comes. Even if the estimate we have made proves to be unduly optimistic, it is not too much to expect that, in the event of a supreme national emergency, feelings of patriotism would, as has always been the case in the past, induce a certain number of gentlemen to come forward and take commissions, and we may, I think, anticipate that, should their services he required, some 200 or 300 officers would be forth-corning in this way with whom we have no means of getting into touch at present, but many of whom would have had the advantage of the improved training now given in the Officers Training Corps. In the early stages of the South African War, during the month of April, 1900, 1,200 gentlemen volunteered their services as officers. From the foregoing it will be seen that though there is a considerable shortage of officers in Special Reserve units in peace time, there is every reason to believe that it can be made good in time of war to enable these units to fulfil their functions as feeding battalions.<lb/>
There are two remarks I wish to add. The first is that this does not represent
<col>990</col>
mere schemes in the air. This is what the Military Secretary's Department and the Training Department have been working at for the last eighteen months. The second remark is this. It may seem to the noble Duke unsatisfactory that we should not have officers ready to hand. But when, at any time in our history, have We ever been in the position of having them ready to hand? And when has any army, except the German Army, for the special reason which I have given, had its officers ready to hand? You always have that situation in time of war. All I can say is there is now more organisation, especially having regard to the difference which the Officers Training Corps is making, than we have had before. I do not say that it is ideal. It cannot be made ideal in a country where the voluntary system is the order of the day. And when you look back to Militia days and remember that the number of officers was dropping off year by year, for social reasons to which I alluded last Week, it is obvious that you could not expect to get officers unless under a new system. It was to meet that want that the Officers Training Corps was designed, and time will show whether it has been successfully designed or not. But take it as you will and put it as you may, there ought to be no difficulty, in a great national emergency, of doing what we have done in the past; and I hope we will have a still better chance in the future of getting sufficient officers with a sufficient amount of training to make them useful and brave officers in the work which they will have to do.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02079"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Viscount has taken a not very usual course in reading out a rather lengthy Memorandum to the House. But, despite the very full nature of the information which lie has given us, I very much doubt whether there is any man among your Lordships, unless it is the noble Duke, who is in the slightest wiser as regards the actual replies to the very succinct Questions which appear on the Paper. I have followed good many of these discussions, and have noticed that the noble Viscount's method of warfare is always to cover himself with a cloud of skirmishers in front in order to hide the main body, and when we come to the main body he withdraws at the most critical moment of the combat. I have not joined in several of these discussions
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0521"/>
<col>991</col>
of late so that we might avoid appearing to be constantly pressing the noble Viscount.<lb/>
We have the advantage of two experts in this House&#x2014;the noble Viscount, who is the author of a most abstruse work; and the noble Duke, who is the interpreter of it to your Lordships. Their disagreements are not really intelligible to all of us, and what I would suggest is that the noble Viscount should take one date which represents the past and a fair date representing the present, and give us the results. At the beginning of his remarks the noble Viscount said something about the facility of mobilisation now as compared with the time of the South African war. We all admit that the number of officers at that time was insufficient. It was the general resolution of Parliament that the number should be increased. I think that a fair date to take would be seven years ago, before the noble Viscount took office and at a time when the influence of the war had passed away&#x2014;say January 1, 1905. I do not wish to give the War Office prolonged labour, but let us have simply the number of Regular officers, the number of Militia officers, and the number of Volunteer and Yeomanry officers on January 1, 1905. Then let us have the number of Regular officers, the number of Reserve officers, the number of Special Reserve officers, and the number of Territorial officers on January 1, 1912.<lb/>
I sincerely hope that the advantage may lie with 1912. But the Return would have this advantage, that at all events we should be able to see whether the belief which the noble Viscount has frequently expressed, that he will be able to mobilise a much larger number of Regular troops, is justified. That has been challenged over and over again by the noble Duke, who has represented these officers as stage officers whom the noble Viscount moves about from the Special Reserve&#x2014;where they are undoubtedly wanted, and, if they are not there, their places must be taken by non-commissioned officers when mobilisation takes place&#x2014;to the Regular Army, which the noble Duke has shown requires all these officers in order to take the field. The Return would show us also I the position as to numbers, and it would leave it in our power to comment, if we thought it necessary, on the amount of training that Special Reserve officers will
<col>992</col>
have had as compared with that of the old Militia officers. I hope that the noble Viscount will see his way to give us this very simple Return, and if he promises it I would, on my part, appeal to the noble Duke and my other friends to leave the controversy until we have got the whole of the facts, and then, if necessary, raise the matter in some form which will enable not merely this House but the country to understand the results of the discussion. I am afraid a great deal that fell from the noble Viscount will not be reported in the Press.</membercontribution></p>

But quite incorrect if it means the provision we make on mobilisation. I explained the last time I spoke that under the system which we have now there is a growing number of officers from the Officers Training Corps who do not take commissions attached to a particular unit in the Special Reserve, but take them in a general list attached to the regiment to which the unit belongs. These do not train at the same time as the unit, but they release from training at other times Regular officers who train with the unit. If the noble Duke goes and looks at a Special Reserve unit training he will not find it short of officers, as he suggests. He will find that other officers have come in, and those other officers are only there because there are Special Reserve officers on the unattached list who release those officers and do their work at other times.</membercontribution></p>

But when you have got the Return it will not give all the information which the noble Viscount desiderates. You cannot compare unlike with unlike, and there is no analogy between the position as it was then and the position to-day.

There are many cases in which traders keep books up to a certain point, and when they find it is convenient to do so they destroy them and become bankrupt.

It must be remembered, in the first place, that the making of the failure to keep books a criminal offence is quite an innovation in Bankruptcy Law. As matters at present stand, where a bankrupt has not kept books the Judge takes that into consideration with regard to granting his discharge or not. This clause as drafted in the Bill proposes to make this a criminal offence only on the second bankruptcy, and that provision the President of the Board of Trade and his advisers consider proper. The effect of the Amendment moved by Lord Hollenden would be to make any person who failed to keep books before his first bankruptcy amenable to the criminal law. Although we are anxious that persons trading on credit should keep proper books stating what their financial position is, we do not think at the present moment that it would be advisable to enlarge the provisions of this clause to the extent asked by my noble friend.</membercontribution></p>

When this Bill was before your Lordships on a former occasion the noble Earl in charge of it gave us to understand that the word "gambling" was governed by the words "unconnected with his trade or business"; so that the clause was not directed to interfering with legitimate speculation in the trader's business. It was recognised that all trading is to some extent of a speculative character. To say that a man who gambled actually in his own business was guilty of a criminal offence would be a very serious extension of the law; and so the noble Earl, in order to console us, told us that the gambling must be "unconnected with the trade or business." But that does not appear to be so from the wording of this paragraph. The words "unconnected with his trade or business" really apply to "any rash and hazardous speculations." That reading of the Bill is confirmed by the appearance, a little lower down in paragraph (<i>b</i>), of the words "gambling or by such rash and hazardous speculations." The insertion of the word "such" rather shows that the gambling is general gambling and is not limited in any way. I do not wish to commit myself to any general approval of this subsection. The inclusion of gambling at all is a very great extension of the law, but I think the Government ought to be quite clear what they mean in their Bill.</membercontribution></p>

The noble Marquess said: I am conscious of my rashness in embarking upon this very technical matter, and my only excuse as a layman for touching upon it is the very great regard which your Lordships have always paid to the sanctity of marriage settlements. When a parent or guardian is entrusting the future life or fortunes of a daughter or ward to her
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0529"/>
<col>1007</col>
husband it is natural and proper that he should take every precaution that she should be protected in case of such mischance as the commercial losses of her husband, and it appears to me that the care which the parent or guardian thus displays ought to be protected in every possible way by Parliament.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02201">I ask your Lordships to consider the object the Government have in view, at least what I apprehend they have in view, and then consider the effect of this clause and the change which I now propose. What is the object which the Government have in view? I take it that it is this. They want to prevent a common form of evasion of the Bankruptcy Law, an evasion which takes this form, that when a man sees he is about to become bankrupt he gets rid of his property to his wife or someone else on whom he can rely and so cheats his creditors. A particular form of that evasion is this. When a man sees he is going to become bankrupt he contracts a marriage, and by settling on his wife not only the property he possesses but any property he may become possessed of hereafter he succeeds in defrauding his creditors. The Government, I understand, are endeavouring to stop that kind of evasion. But they have cast their net very wide, and they actually propose, not merely to declare void a settlement made under such terms, but even if the settlement has been made years and years before they propose to make void a payment made under it many years subsequently unless that payment has been made two years before the actual bankruptcy takes place. It is quite clear that, under such a clause as this, perfectly <i>bon&#x00E2; fide</i> precautions taken by a parent or guardian at the time of marriage might be rendered wholly inoperative. There might be a covenant or contract of settlement made ten or twelve years before the bankruptcy which might contemplate as one of its provisions that money to come subsequently to the husband from some particular person should be protected for the wife under the settlement. Yet if years after that the husband got into pecuniary difficulties, and the actual case contemplated by the settlement did not occur more than two years before the bankruptcy, then all these precautions would be torn up and the woman for whom all this had been carefully arranged would be left without this benefit which was one of the con-
<col>1008</col>
siderations for which she was allowed to contract the marriage. That cannot be the intention of His Majesty's Government.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02202">I do not know whether I have made the case clear. Let me give an example. Let us say that when a woman was about to be married one of the conditions which were put into the settlement by the husband was that money from a particular source which might hereafter come to him should be part of her property under the settlement. It might be that besides certain property of which he was then possessed he had expectations from his father. The father might have assured him that he would be remembered in his will. The husband might say that all that came to him from that source hereafter was to go to his wife. His father might go on living a long time after the marriage was contracted, and in the meantime the husband might be getting into commercial difficulties. Then one day the father dies, the will is read, and the money goes into the possession of the husband and is paid over into the settlement. But if within two years of the payment over of that money the man becomes bankrupt, then, if you please, the creditors are to be allowed to come down and tear up the whole of that arrangement, and the money is to be taken from the wife and paid over to the creditors. Surely it is clear that the moment of evasion is not when the money is paid over, but when the covenant or contract is signed. It is possible that where a man, seeing bankruptcy impending, enters into a covenant to defeat his creditors there may be evasion. But when the actual payment takes place there is no opportunity of evasion&#x2014;it is in pursuance of a contract made before.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02203">I propose by my Amendment to substitute the words "covenant or contract" for the words "payment or transfer," and I should have thought that it almost stands to reason that that is fair. It may be said that the kind of settlement which I have indicated, wherein a man puts into settlement money which he is not at present possessed of but which he may hereafter acquire, is not a very common settlement. But if it is not very common in the case of a man, it is a very common form of settlement on the woman's side. And your Lordships will remember that in this very Bill the Government are
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0530"/>
<col>1009</col>
enabling married women to be in entirely the same position with regard to bankruptcy following on failure in trade or commerce as a man is. Therefore the case in such settlements as I have referred to is material to the arguments I have addressed to your Lordships' House. Though we are, as my noble friend behind me said, a commercial country, we are not only a commercial country. There are other considerations besides purely commercial considerations which have to be borne in mind. It is a strange thing that everybody is protected under covenants or contracts in this clause except the wife. Of the money is assigned to somebody else, then; those who receive it are protected, but the woman herself is not protected. Surely I am right in saying that marriage is always regarded as a consideration, for the, woman gives something of value in; that she gives the most valuable thing she possesses&#x2014;namely, herself. The provision as it stands in the clause appeal's to me one of inequity and injustice which I am sure the Government do not intend. I beg to move&#x2014;</p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-02206"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: I share the sympathy of the noble Marquess opposite for marriage contracts, and agree with him as to the desirability of protecting the interests which marriage contracts create. The consideration of marriage is, I agree with him, one of the gravest of considerations, and ought to be protected, by law. But I do not think the noble; Marquess quite realises what he is asking your Lordships to assent to. It is all very well to take what seems to be a hard case, but you cannot extend that to other cases without seeing what the nature of the other cases is. if a person has property&#x2014;land, investments, or a specific sum of money&#x2014;which can be ear-marked, it is, quite right that upon marriage that sum of money should be settled, and settled; in the hands of trustees so that in the event of bankruptcy no creditors can touch it.<lb/>
But let me put the other side of the case. I have an illustration here which is a very cogent one. It concerns litigation which came before this House sitting in
<col>1010</col>
its judicial capacity. There was a gentleman who married in 1879 and made a covenant just such as the noble Marquess suggests. He covenanted to settle all the property to which he might become entitled, except his business assets. Well, in 1880, having by means of this covenant covered the whole of his property except what he had in business, he became bankrupt. He got his discharge in 1882 and started again in business, and in 1894 became bankrupt for the second time. Being an ingenious person he then turned about for other means of livelihood. He became an outside broker&#x2014;a business which, I believe, gives opportunities for highly ingenious enterprise&#x2014;and made large profits. He got together &#x00A3;17,000 as the result of speculations, and he bought a house in which he settled himself with his wife and family. In May, 1903&#x2014;a long time after the marriage, which, as I have said, took place in 1879&#x2014;he found himself indebted to the extent of &#x00A3;10,000 to his creditors on the Stock Exchange. He then, on the 23rd of that month, transferred the house aid furniture to the trustees of his marriage settlement in pursuance of this omnibus covenant. On May 29, six days later, he committed an act of bankruptcy, and the unfortunate creditors naturally tried to get hold of this &#x00A3;17,000 house which was bought really out of the proceeds of his speculations during his fortunate period. The case was fought and was brought up to this House, and your Lordships, sitting on the judicial side, had to regretfully declare that the law afforded no means of redress against this monstrous fraud. If the noble Marquess's Amendment were accepted that case might remain absolutely un-redressed.<lb/>
The noble Marquess took one side, and I am presenting the other. The question is what is the right line of legislation between the two. What the Government, after consultation with their advisers, think is the right line is this. If a man or a woman has a house or piece of land or a specific sum of money invested which is thrown into settlement on marriage, that should be sacred. On the other hand, it is equally clear that there should not be power to enter into the covenant which the ingenious gentleman whose career I have described entered into. The true view seems to me to be that what you should be at liberty to settle is just what
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0531"/>
<col>1011</col>
the clause describes. The clause enables you to settle any property in which you have at the date of marriage any estate or interest, whether vested or contingent, in possession or remainder, or property or money in right of the wife or husband as the case may be. That is quite right, because there you have the specific thing. But surely it cannot be right that you should be enabled to enter into a covenant which is to operate on something which you have not got. The noble Marquess referred to expectations from a man's father. The father could himself have put a clause in his will so settling the property, but if he leaves a sum of money at large to the son, surely the son had no better title to speculate upon that and to treat it as the subject of an omnibus covenant like this than to speculate on profits that he was likely to make. The clause is indeed a little more hard against creditors than might have been expected, because it allows a man who has entered into an omnibus covenant of this kind and who has made a transfer to have that transfer protected if it has taken place within two years of the bankruptcy.<lb/>
To my mind the opportunity should be taken when you are altering the law of seeing that the monstrous conduct of which the man was guilty in the litigation to which I have referred should not continue protected. I think it is a monstrous state of the law, and I am glad that we are able to take this opportunity of putting it on a better footing. I hope what I have said may have gone some way to convince the noble Marquess that we have, on the balance of advantages and disadvantages, taken the enormous balance of advantages in the public interest in drawing the clause in this form. The noble Marquess said it would be hard in the case of a married woman. I agree with that in the case of the ordinary married woman for whose benefit the original covenant was invented. But the position of woman has advanced. There are some so enterprising that they go into trade and become bankrupt with quite as much freedom and facility as any one else, and I do not think your Lordships are entitled to protect women who go into business. One step I beg your Lordships to take in the interests of the sudden and somewhat startling rise in the position of woman in the commercial world, and that is to apply the Bankruptcy Laws to her as freely as you do to your own sex.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-02207"><member>LORD FABER</member><membercontribution>: This is a very technical point, but it arises frequently in trade, and I venture to repeat what I had the honour of saying in the discussion of this Bill on Second Reading. A trader, a single man, has lost all his own money and is trading with his creditors' money. He says to himself, "How am I to get my creditors' money so that it cannot be taken away from me if I become bankrupt?" There is only one way, and it is often employed. He gets married, and marriage being a good consideration he settles the whole of the creditors' money on his wife. The creditors come next week and want their money, and he says "There is none for you." He may have &#x00A3;30,000 or &#x00A3;40,000 of their money, but as it is settled on his wife the creditors cannot touch it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02208"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: I would point out that if the man in question married the previous week the covenant would not be two years old, and would not in any way be affected by my Amendment. We all agree that if a covenant or contract is made just before bankruptcy, or even within two years before bankruptcy, it may be an evasion of the Bankruptcy Act. But the case which I am contemplating, and the only case which would be affected by my Amendment, is where the contract or covenant has been made a long time before, but where it is only the payment which has been made within two years.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02209"><member>LORD FABER</member><membercontribution>: What we want is to prevent a trader settling the creditors' money, and how are we to do that except by a clause of this sort I We must have some method of preventing a trader taking the creditors' money and settling it on his wife. Is it not rather the duty of a father or guardian, before consenting to the marriage, to look into the trader's affairs beforehand and see exactly how he stands?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02210"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: We are embarked upon a difficult subject, and one which, as I warned your Lordships on the Second Reading, is embarrassing to those who are experts, and must be still more so to those who are not experts. For example, the noble Lord who has just sat down instanced the case where a man who had money which he really ought to have paid to his creditors contracted a marriage and settled that money on his wife. The noble Lord seemed to
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0532"/>
<col>1013</col>
think that the effect of this clause would be, or ought to be, to make void that settlement. Not in the least, my Lords. If a man has any money which in law is his, and he, possessing it, settles it upon the highest of all considerations&#x2014;namely marriage&#x2014;then unless you can show that there was actual fraud to which he and the wife and all the rest of them were parties you cannot interfere with that. That is not this Bill, still less is it the Amendment of the noble Marquess.<lb/>
The proposal in the Bill is this, if I may put it in a few sentences. You want to treat with the greatest consideration every settlement that is made, even though it be a settlement in anticipation that money may be earned in trade hereafter and when earned may then be handed over to the trustees. But, on the other hand, it is quite obvious that a settlement of that kind may be abused so as to enable a man to go into trade and contract debts and then swoop down just before he is called upon to pay his just debts and, by virtue of the covenant which has been made, take away all the means with which in all honesty he ought to pay his legitimate debts. What you want to do is to draw the line fairly between the two classes of people&#x2014;on the one hand, the wife, who trusts to this very trading in order that any money may exist at all; and the creditors, without whose dealings in trade the money never would have been obtainable. What is done is this. We say that where money is so earned and not settled any transfer or payment of it in pursuance of a covenant made in the air before the marriage was contracted shall be void unless it can be shown that the transfer was made two years before the bankruptcy or that at the date of the transfer the man was solvent. That is the way you adjudicate the equity between these two kinds of people.<lb/>
What does the noble Marquess propose? Let me put his suggestion and invite him to consider what it means. He says that every such payment or transfer shall be good if the covenant&#x2014;the marriage contract, that is&#x2014;was made two years before. That is to say, a man may make a contract of this kind and may subsequently put it to every kind of dishonest use. The case to which my noble and learned friend Lord Haldane referred could, under this Amendment, be repeated. Does not the
<col>1014</col>
noble Marquess see that m this relation the date of the marriage contract is irrelevant? The unfairness as between the settlement trustees and the creditors is just the same however long or however short the period between the marriage contract and the insolvency. But the noble Marquess would allow the lapse of two years to cleanse the whole thing. Surely that cannot be right.<lb/>
The second thing the noble Marquess's Amendment would do would be this. If at the date of the contract&#x2014;that is to say, at the date of the marriage settlement&#x2014;the settlor was solvent, then the creditors would be defeated. How can that be right? A man if he marries as a young man is generally quite solvent. He probably has nothing and owes nothing. To say that, as this man was quite solvent twenty years ago, therefore he may make this covenant surely cannot be right. That is not a relevant consideration at all. Whether this is right, or wrong ought to be settled by what is fair play between, on the one side, the trustees of the settlement, and, on the other, the creditors, by trading with whom the whole of the profits are made, and not by the consideration whether twenty years or ten years before the gentleman who contracted this marriage and made this marriage settlement was solvent or not. Marriage is the highest of all considerations, and I, as much as any Judge who ever sat on the Bench, will always endeavour to protect marriage contracts and the covenants connected therewith sacredly. But do not allow contracts which are not based upon existing realities but which hypothecate in advance speculative future acquisitions to be used against those with whom the trading husband deals, so as in effect to sweep away unfairly from them the assets to which they were legitimately entitled to look in order to implement the business contracts made by the husband.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02211"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: I confess I am disposed to vote for this Amendment, although I do not say that it is ideally perfect. But surely it is within the resources of legal science to contrive some form of words more just than those in the clause. One of the greatest pieces of injustice ever done was the sweeping away in 1834 of the right of dower, and it is, I think, to complete it to leave a woman, although she has a settlement, without
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0533"/>
<col>1015</col>
protection. If the Government resist any amendment of this clause I shall vote with my noble friend behind me. I suggest that it might be possible to be a little more lenient in respect to what settlement may be considered good. One knows something of the 27th of Elizabeth, where the test is whether the person was solvent at the time the settlement was made. It is not a new form, but one with which we are very familiar, and we have generally got rid of those difficulties by referring to the intention with which such and such a thing was done and making that fraudulent which was found to have been done with fraudulent intent. Something between the Government's proposal and that of my noble friend behind me might, I think, he suggested. I shall certainly vote with him if the Government show no sign of yielding.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02212"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: I recognise that my Amendment, as my noble and learned friend has said, is not ideally perfect, and I feel that I should be doing wrong if I pressed it upon your Lordships at the present stage. I feel greatly flattered that I have drawn such speeches from noble and learned Lords, who must have thought much of what I said exposed a great deal of ignorance on this most difficult subject. The lucid speech of the Lord Chancellor has shown me how difficult a subject this is, and I should be sorry to press upon the House on a matter of law of this kind an Amendment against which so much can be said. But I hope that between now and the next stage of the Bill the Government will consider what fell from my noble and learned friend, Lord Halsbury, and see whether they cannot arrive at some middle course to protect legitimate forms of marriage settlements consistently with stopping the evasion of which the noble and learned Lords opposite complain.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02213"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: I need not state what the authority of the noble and learned Earl opposite is on these matters. If he can suggest any, what I may term, palliative&#x2014;although I do not think when he examines the clause he will find that it is a really severe one&#x2014;we will pay the greatest attention to it. Intent in this instance can hardly be the test, because you would have to establish at the commencement a desire to defraud, and this is not necessarily a fraud&#x2014;it
<col>1016</col>
is only a disposition of assets in one direction which in fairness ought not to be exclusively directed there. If the noble and learned Earl can suggest an improved wording we shall certainly consider it. Of course, I cannot say we will accept it, but we will give it most respectful consideration.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ART EXHIBITIONS AND THE SHOPS ACT.</title>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02317"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF PLYMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask His Majesty's Government whether societies of artists, holding annual exhibitions at which works of art may be purchased by the public, are required under the last section of the Second Schedule to the Shops Act, 1912, to apply to the local authority for a certificate that they are entitled to exemption. I put this Question on behalf of the Imperial Artists League, which represents a considerable number of the societies that hold exhibitions of pictures and art in London. It is not clear whether it was intended that these societies should be subject to the Shops Act. Their position seems to be an ambiguous one. If they are required to apply to the local authority for a certificate that they are entitled to exemption, there seems to be considerable difficulty in their position.<lb/>
<col>1024</col>
At the end of the first paragraph of Section 6 of the Shops Act appears a provision that the local authority must be satisfied, if there are any objections to their Order, that the occupiers of at least two-thirds in number of the shops affected by the Order approve the Order, and they may then make the Order. Then in Section 9, the section which deals with provisions as to trading elsewhere than in shops, it is provided that it shall not be lawful in any locality to carry on in any place not being a shop, retail trade or business of any class at any time when it would be unlawful in that locality to keep a shop open for the purpose of retail trade and business of that sort. It July be that these exhibitions are treated in the same class as dealers' premises, which are shops under the Act. I venture to put this Question in the hope that His Majesty's Government will consider whether such exhibitions, if the Shops Act applies to them, could not be placed in a separate class, and whether special regulations might not be made for picture exhibitions which are open for a limited period and do not carry on a continuous business.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02318"><member>THE PAYMASTER-GENERAL (LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl's Question involves an interpretation of the Shops Act, 1912. The point which he raises is really a point of law, and it is not within the province of a Minister or a Department to interpret an Act of Parliament. That is a matter for a Court of Law, and until such a case as that suggested has been decided it is not possible for me or anybody else to give the noble Earl a definite statement one way or the other on the point he has raised. But if the noble Earl asks me for my personal opinion, it would be in the affirmative. I think the real point is whether picture exhibitions such as he has in mind come under the definition of retail trade. Any exhibition in which pictures are sold whereby the society which exhibits the pictures derives some advantage, either by commission or otherwise, seems to me to come within the definition of retail trade. If so, it falls under Section 4 and is liable to the half-holiday closing order, and this provision can only be modified by the local authority, who are given power in the last sentence of the Second Schedule to certify that such retail trade is subsidiary or ancillary only to the main business of the exhibition
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0538"/>
<col>1025</col>
or show. I do not understand how Section 6 or Section 9 applies to this case. Section 6 has reference to early closing; it has nothing to do, so far as I can see, with the question before us, which really comes under Section 4. Section 9, again, is not germane to the subject.<lb/>
But on the general question as to whether these exhibitions suffer hardship from falling under the provisions of Section 4, I would like to point out to the noble Earl that there is really very little difference between a society which exhibits pictures for sale and derives profit from the sale of those pictures and a Bond-street dealer who exhibits artists' pictures for sale and receives commission. It seems to us that the two cases are really analogous, and if the dealer is to come under the provisions of the Act a society which is really fulfilling similar functions should fall under the same provision. I suggest that it is not a great hardship for a society which is a <i>bona fide</i> exhibitor of pictures to make application to the local authority, who I imagine in almost every case would be only too glad to exempt exhibitions from the provisions to which the noble Earl takes exception. However, that is only my personal opinion. I suggest to
<col>1026</col>
him that it is a case for a Court of Law to determine.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02319"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF PLYMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: I wish to thank the noble Lord for the answer he has given me. The only point that I would emphasise is this. If the exhibitions of these societies were classed together and if no difference was made between them and the premises of picture and art dealers, they might be outvoted&#x2014;that is to say, two-thirds of this particular class might be in favour of closing on Saturday afternoon, which might be the very afternoon when, from the point of view of the public, it would lie a great hardship that these exhibitions should be closed. I quite understand that if I was asking a question on what is really a point of law the noble Lord could not answer it. But could not these particular societies be placed in a different class and their case judged separately? I make that suggestion in the hope that the noble Lord will kindly consider it.</membercontribution></p>

It is not desired to read it a second time until the Standing Orders Committee of the House of Commons have given a decision which they are expected to give very shortly, but their decision has not been arrived at in time for me to move the Second Reading of the Bill now. The Bill to which I refer is the Great Central Railway Bill, and the particular subject concerns a dock at Grimsby. It is a late Bill, and I do not wish to move that it be read a second time until it is known whether the Standing Orders Committee in another place will dispense with their Standing Orders to allow the Bill to proceed. The decision of that Committee will not be known until later this afternoon, and if their decision is in favour of the Bill proceeding, it is important that it should be read a second time before we adjourn for the Whitsuntide recess, so that the time for depositing petitions might commence to run at once and the

<title>FOREIGN AND MILITARY POLICY.</title>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02338"><member>THE EARL OF PORTSMOUTH</member> rose to call attention to a speech delivered by the Secretary of State for War at Barn-staple on April 20, and to ask His Majesty's Government how they are able to reconcile the principles of foreign and military policy then enunciated with recent events and the statement made to the House of Commons by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02339">The noble Earl said: My Lords, in calling attention to the speech which the noble Viscount delivered at Barnstaple, I must remind your Lordships of what was said by Sir Edward Grey in November last in the House of Commons. I shall therefore be obliged to read from the speech of the Foreign Minister an extract which generally summarises the foreign policy which Sir Edward Grey, after full and careful deliberation, considers is the one which should be accepted by this country. Speaking in the House of Commons on November 27 last, Sir Edward Grey made use of these words&#x2014;
<quote>"There is one foreign policy different from the one which I have been endeavouring to sketch to the House, and it seems to me to be advocated in some quarters of the country. It seems to me to be simply disastrous. It is that we should give it to be understood that in no circumstances, however aggressively, provocatively, or wantonly, a friend of ours was attacked, we should give our friend no assistance whatever. That would be an attempt in revert to what was once called a policy of 'splendid isolation.' It would deprive us of the possibility of having a friend in Europe, and it would result m the other nations of Europe, either by choice or by necessity, being brought into the orbit of a single diplomacy from which we should be excluded. The ideal of splendid isolation contemplated a balance of power in Europe to which we were not to be a party, and from which we were to be able to stand aside in the happy position of having no obligations and being able to take advantage of any difficulties which arose in Europe from friction between opposing Powers. That policy is not a possible one now. Any single Power that attempted to adopt that policy in Europe to-day would be felt as a public nuisance, and if we were that single Power, one result would be that m the course of a few years we should be building warships, not against a two-Power standard, but probably against the united navies of Europe. As a matter of fact that policy, which would be disastrous, is not a policy. It is the negation of policy."</quote>
<col>1030</col>
Those words are very clear and distinct, and I believe that the vast majority of the people of this country supported Sir Edward Grey in that clear and moderate statement of our policy abroad.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02340">I must ask your Lordships to consider the effect of the language of the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War. Speaking at Barnstaple on April 20&#x2014;I am quoting from the <i>Western Morning News</i> report, which I believe to be on the whole the most reliable report I could get&#x2014;the noble Viscount made use of these words&#x2014;
<quote>"All military organisation, all naval organisation in this country depends on foreign policy."</quote>
I am sure We entirely agree with the noble Viscount on that point. He proceeded&#x2014;
<quote>"It is on our foreign policy that the shape of our Army and Navy depends&#x2026;If foreign policy changes, you will Have to have a new system, but I hope foreign policy is not likely to change. I do not think it is likely to change, as I believe our best policy is to be as free as possible of Continental alliances, to manage our own affairs in our own great Dominions, to have our great Fleet commanding the sea, to have our great Oversea Army which we can send anywhere&#x2014;the Continent or anywhere else necessary&#x2014;and to retain our independence, relying for home defence on the voluntary efforts of our citizens."</quote>
I do not know what the noble Viscount meant by our independence unless it implied an independence of all understandings with foreign Powers. It does seem to me to be impossible to reconcile the principles of policy stated by Sir Edward Grey and those views expressed by the noble Viscount opposite.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02341">I should also like to ask the noble Viscount what he means when he talks of our great Oversea Army. He went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"We have 320,000 men engaged for oversea service&#x2014;77,000 in India&#x2026;"</quote>
But, my Lords, we could not send the men in India anywhere. Those men in time of crisis, or presumably so, would have to remain in India. Then the noble Viscount went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"We have an Expeditionary Army with its line of communications which is about three times as large as the Expeditionary Army for oversea service of any other Power in the world."</quote>
I cannot understand what the noble Viscount had in his mind when he spoke of our having an enormous Oversea Army. He went on to speak of Germany. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"Germany has somewhere under 3,000 men who are engaged for voluntary service oversea. They have 3,000 men in Africa; that is the whole Oversea Army of Germany."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0541"/>
<col>1031</col>
But surely the German Army and the French Army, provided they had the ships, would go and take their part wherever the theatre of war was in Europe. It seems to me ridiculous to talk about the German Oversea Army as limited to 3,000 men. Why, I believe that at the present moment, though it is difficult to get at the exact figures, it is a modest computation to say that the Italians have at least 100,000 men in a purely Expeditionary Force in North Africa.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02342">I come back to the point of an Oversea Army. When the noble Viscount talks about a great Oversea Army, let us see what the great armies of the Continent are, which for all practical purposes, if they could land on these shores, could be used as much against us in England as if we were part of the Continent. At the present moment, putting it at a very modest computation, the Germans can put at least 900,000 men into the field at once, and it is a very modest computation also to say that the French could put at least 700,000 men into the field at once. I should like, now that I am touching on this question of Germany and France, to call your Lordships' attention to this fact, which is a very significant, and, I confess, a very serious one. The population of Germany is 65,000,000, with a yearly increase of 900,000. The population of France is 40,000,000, and their population is practically stationary. The French have to take at the present moment for military and naval purposes, of those attaining the age of twenty, 77 per cent.; the Germans have only to take 47 per cent. Germany, by adding, as she has decided to do, 29,000 men to her peace establishment, will in five years' time add at least another 100,000 men, well trained, to her army. On the other hand, the French Military Budget for 1912 provides, owing to decreasing birth rate, for a decrease of 10,000 men as compared with 1911. All these facts give great weight to what I have no doubt was in the mind of Sir John French when he spoke at the Royal Academy and stated that the maintenance of these great Continental armies must depend very largely upon the maintenance of population. That brings me back to this point. I have great respect and regard for the German people, but this is not a time when, if we wish to maintain our good feeling with and fulfil our obligations to France, we ought, knowing how
<col>1032</col>
pressed in regard to population the French are, to show any inclination that we are not prepared to take our part in a reasonable assertion of the balance of power in Europe.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02343">There is another part of the speech of the noble Viscount which seems to me to indicate a contradiction or confusion of thought, unless it is a further emphasis of the policy of splendid isolation. Speaking on the subject of home defence the noble Viscount said&#x2014;
<quote>"We do not need to make home defence our first concern, as we are girt round with the sea, and so long as we have a Navy that commands the sea we can rely on the exertions of the citizens, properly organised, to do the rest. Our first line of home defence is the Navy, the second our professional Army, and the third the Territorial Force, which owes its existence to the sense of duty of our citizens. If we tried to combine the thing, if we brought in compulsion, we should do just what the Chancellor of the Exchequer does&#x2014;he stops all voluntary gifts to himself."</quote>
With your Lordships' permission I would like to deal with these sentences as they stand. The noble Viscount says, first of all, that we can rely on the exertions of the citizens properly organised. If that means anything it means the Territorial Army. It is not necessary to make general statements against the Territorial Army. Every one realises, no one more than myself, the enormous difficulties that have confronted and must confront the Territorial Army. Among other things, I think people are beginning to realise that the Territorial system is one which in a nation like ours, a great commercial nation, introduces, not technically a system of compulsion, but involves and brings with it a great sense of hardship. The best of those who join the Territorial Army&#x2014;I think the larger portion of them&#x2014;are more or less engaged in trade. One of the reasons which I am convinced in my own mind is beginning to have a considerable effect in recruiting for the Territorial Army is this, that the men are beginning to realise that not only are they performing a duty which ought to be shared by all alike, but that in case of mobilisation they are placing themselves in a very serious business difficulty. What I mean is this. Supposing that the system of the Territorial Army had obtained during the time of the South African war. Men engaged in business in London and elsewhere would have had to leave their places and would have been taken away from them for an indefinite time, and they
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0542"/>
<col>1033</col>
realise the fact that, however well disposed employers may be, it is impossible for them to keep the places open for an indefinite period.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02344">But, my Lords, do not let us go into the question now merely as to the difficulties of the Territorial Army. Let us look at the facts as they have been disclosed to us by official statements. We know, according to the last Return&#x2014;that of October 1, 1911&#x2014;that we had a shortage in officers of 1,774; in non-commissioned officers and men, of 47,351&#x2014;the difference between strength and establishment. We know that the engagements of over 80,000 non-commissioned officers and men expire between October 1, 1911, and September, 1912. We know also that if these men remain on it is not possible for them to form a Reserve. We know, further, that after four years of existence the Territorial Force Reserve numbers only 166 officers, and 490 of other ranks. Again, we know that Sir John French, in his official Report, was not able to say a single word as regards the efficiency of the Territorial Army. He spoke a great deal of their patriotism, but said nothing about their efficiency. We know also that quite recently he told the East Anglian Brigade that the Territorial Artillery could not possibly be fit to meet Regular troops without more training. We know that there were absent from camp, with leave, 1,450 officers and 25,317 non-commissioned officers and men, and that there were absent, without leave, 41 officers and 6,703 non-commissioned officers and men; so that out of a total strength of 264,000, about one-eighth, or 33,500 officers and men, did not attend camp at all.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02345">Then as regards the question of discipline. No punishment has been awarded for absence without leave; in fact, the Under Secretary of State for War, in reply to a Question in the other House on May 7 as to what punishment had been awarded to the officers and men of the Special Reserve who had absented themselves without leave, and who I find from the Army Annual Report number 41 officers and 1,455 men, said that the War Office had no information as to whether any, and, if so, what punishment had been awarded to these men for what, after all, as regards the Special Reserve, which is a higher branch of the Army, is a very serious offence. Then as regards physique.</p>
<col>1034</col>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02346">We know that 12.76 per cent. of the Territorials are under nineteen years of age. As regards the physique of the recruits of the Special Reserve, Colonel Seely would not give any information. I am informed&#x2014;I hope it is not general&#x2014;that in some cases men have been engaged whose height was only 5 feet 1&#x00BD; inches, and their chest measurement 29&#x00BD; inches, and it is really absurd to suppose that these men can possibly carry the field service equipment, which, as your Lordships know, amounts to close upon 60 lbs.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02347">Then the noble Viscount said that our second line of defence against invasion is our professional Army. If our professional Army is to be our second line of home defence, what becomes of the Expeditionary Force? You cannot count it two ways. I think it was the noble Marquess who leads this House who, in some former discussion on this subject, implied that if we could not send the whole of the six Divisions of the Expeditionary Force abroad we should have to send fewer. Judging human nature by what it is, do you suppose that if we were confronted by a serious Continental Power the people of this country would allow our shores to run the risk of being invaded by 70,000 men, if they could get across and avoid our Fleet, and permit the invaders to be confronted only by Territorials whose numbers and discipline and training are admitted by official figures to be absolutely incomplete and inefficient?</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02348">Then I come to another sentence in the noble Viscount's speech&#x2014;
<quote>"If we tried to combine the thing, if we brought in compulsion, we should do just what the Chancellor of the Exchequer does&#x2014;he stops all voluntary gifts to himself."</quote>
It is always difficult&#x2014;in fact, it is impossible&#x2014;when you enter into the region of prophecy, to know exactly what will take place. It is impossible to predict exactly what would be the effect, if we had in any shape or kind a compulsory system, upon recruiting for outside service; but it seems to me that the balance of fact, judging from the past, is in favour of our being able to work in conjunction a voluntary and a compulsory system. I do not for one moment say that the system of the Militia ballot, which was a matter of chance and unequal, was a good one, but I should like to give your Lordships certain figures which were drawn up by the Adjutant-General's Office in November,
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0543"/>
<col>1035</col>
1813&#x2014;that is to say, figures which showed the working of Lord Castlereagh's Local Militia Act. Those figures are rather significant. That Act, if I remember rightly, was passed in June, 1808, and the following returns were drawn up by the Adjutant-General's Office of that time. In 1809&#x2013;10 we got, for the Napoleonic wars by ordinary recruiting, 20,815; during that year we got 23,885 volunteers under the Local Militia Act. In 1811 the numbers were&#x2014;by ordinary recruiting, 11,472; volunteers, 11,453. In 1812 the numbers were 14,432 and 9,927 respectively; and in 1813, 11,285 and 8,834 respectively. Therefore during the years of the Napoleonic wars 43 per cent. of the recruits were volunteers under the Militia Act. It is not my object to-day to discuss compulsory service, but at the same time, if the noble Viscount wishes to controvert the arguments as to compulsory service, I do not think he can say with any certainty at all that compulsory service would interfere with voluntary recruiting for the Regular Army. There is only one other matter which I wish to put to the noble Viscount. I do think that the country ought to have some assurance that the principles of foreign policy enunciated by Sir Edward Grey now hold the field. Certainly the speech delivered by the noble Viscount reads in a different direction. At any rate, so it seems to me, and I am sure it would have that effect upon a provincial audience. It seems to echo a sort of return to the old provincial policy which we had hoped was dead and buried&#x2014;the policy of splendid isolation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02349">One word more, my Lords. I am very anxious that I should not be misunderstood with regard to a certain sentence in the noble Viscount's speech. I am at one&#x2014;at least I hope I may say I am&#x2014;with the noble Viscount in a dislike and a distrust of what are technically called Continental alliances, offensive as well as defensive. But unless Sir Edward Grey's speech meant nothing and was mere empty verbiage, it is not a reasonable policy for this country to ignore the balance of power in Europe; nor does it seem to me an honourable policy, still less an effective policy, to make no adequate military provision for acting up to any understanding we may have with our friends on the Continent, whose interests under certain contingencies, which it is unnecessary to discuss here this evening, deserve and demand mutual
<col>1036</col>
help and support. Without wishing for one moment&#x2014;I should deprecate it very strongly&#x2014;to use any language which could be provocative to or distrustful of any foreign Power, I do hope the noble Viscount when he rises to speak this evening will be able to assure us that we shall do nothing which in any way could weaken the sense of our good understanding with our friends. I go further than that. I hope that the noble Viscount may realise, perhaps more fully even than he did in his speech at Barnstaple, that it is our duty as well as our interest to provide suitable military provision to carry out our obligations abroad.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02350"><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Notice on the Paper in the name of the noble Earl was to call attention to a speech delivered by me at Barnstaple and to ask the Government how they were able to reconcile the principles of foreign and military policy then enunciated with recent events and the statement made to the House of Commons by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. The exordium and the peroration of the noble Earl's speech dealt with that topic, but in between there was interposed a large body of matter which does not appear strictly relevant to the Notice, and therefore I do not propose to go into the general question of the principles which lie at the foundation of the Territorial Force. I would rather refer the noble Earl to those speeches which he made when he was the eloquent and enthusiastic apostle of this Force during the conduct of the Territorial and Reserve Forces Bill through this House. He spoke to-day of Territorial numbers. Territorial recruiting is always a difficult question. But if I am too optimistic, the noble Earl ought not to be quite so gloomy. After all, on April 1 last year the Territorial Force was within eleven of the highest point it ever reached during the boom period. Recruiting has been very good during this year; and as to the exodus, men have remained and others have taken the places of those who have left. As to the future we cannot tell; we must await that. But as to the present, I do not think that any one has any title to be full of gloom. Then the noble Earl spoke of the lesson to be drawn as to the possibility of combining compulsory service with voluntary recruiting from what took place at the beginnings
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0544"/>
<col>1037</col>
of the last century. The period of the Napoleonic wars was very different from a period of peace. Therefore I do not think much of the case which can be founded upon that.<lb/>
I come to what was the real point of the Notice and speech of the noble Earl. It may be clue to some obtuseness on my part, but I cannot for the life of me find anything that is in the slightest degree inconsistent between my humble utterances at Barnstaple and the speech of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the House of Commons last November. We said, as far as I can see, precisely the same thing. I certainly meant to say the same thing, although I did not say it so well as my right hon. friend did. We both of us spoke in the same sense. It is quite true that the policy of splendid isolation is over. I never said that it was not. I was speaking of the difficulties which alliances impose. I never uttered a single syllable about those friendships, those ententes, which are much more the order of the day than they used to be. What I was speaking of is apparent from the excellent report with which the noble Earl provided himself, and I have in my hand a verbatim report of my speech taken from another local newspaper. What I said was this&#x2014;
<quote>"No one Empire has ever been so great as our Empire, and it extends all over the globe, in distant places to which our soldiers have to go. The result is that we must have a great Navy to command the seas, and an oversea professional Expeditionary Army which can go out and reinforce the garrisons which defend the distant possessions of the Crown. No other country has such an Empire; no other nation such an obligation."</quote>
In that sentence I defined what I meant by an Oversea Army. I did not mean an Army that travelled for a short distance over an arm of the sea, or that crossed a frontier such as that of France or Germany, or that made a short transit like that of Italy. I was speaking of an Oversea Army which is required to defend our distant possessions in India and in other parts of the Dominions of the Crown, which may have to go there for prolonged periods and serve for many years, and the men of which have therefore to be recruited professionally for long service in a fashion which enables you to get them only upon a professional and voluntary basis.<lb/>
The noble Earl referred to the German Army, but if he will give his attention to
<col>1038</col>
the story of the German Army he will find that Germany did not send its compulsorily raised soldiers to China, its last long distance expedition; the men who were sent were raised voluntarily. Germany does not send compulsorily raised soldiers to Africa; she gets them voluntarily. Germany has some 2,850 professionally recruited soldiers for service oversea, as against 320,000 which we get, and get without very great difficulty, under our voluntary system. That is why I said I did not wish to gamble with our present system, because our present system is essential to us so long as our distant Dominions are not in a position to provide for their own defence. Therefore I said that our first concern was a great voluntarily raised Army and a Navy commanding the seas. Then I went on to point out what I meant by alliances. I said I could conceive a change of foreign policy, one in which we entered into actual alliances with other Powers possessing great Navies, which might relieve us from the necessity which we are under at present of keeping an enormous Navy for ourselves. I did not advocate that policy. On the contrary, I said I hoped we might never come to it; but I said that if we did the price exacted by these Powers under alliances might be the provision of a large Army for service on the Continent which could only be got by compulsory service.<lb/>
I pointed out that our military system depended on foreign policy and changes in foreign policy. f should have thought that was a truism, and I ask the noble Earl, Wherein in the enunciation of that truism is there anything inconsistent with what was said by ray right hon. friend in the House of Commons? I certainly said no word in the slightest degree referring to our friendship with France, a friendship on which we rightly set great store. I spoke of a policy of alliances in a sense defined, which is a very different policy from our policy of to-day. Our policy to-day is not a policy of splendid isolation; it is a policy of certain friendships which my right hon. friend explained in the other House. I was not quite sure from the conclusion of the noble Earl's speech whether, although he said he did not like alliances, his mind was not tending a little in the direction of alliances and the kind of Army we might have to raise if the alliances included in their terms the provision of such an Army.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-02351"><member>THE EARL OF PORTSMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: I share with the noble Viscount distrust and dislike of Continental alliances in the technical sense. My first point was that it was possible to read into the speech of the noble Viscount a weakening of the position taken up by Sir Edward Grey, and the other part of my speech was to show that where you have an alliance or understanding your military policy and military position must be sufficient to be able to maintain your diplomacy.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02352"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: I hope I have shown that any suggestion such as the noble Earl feared is not to be read into any utterance of mine. As to the noble Earl's second point, there again he puzzles me. You cannot provide a great Continental Army contemporaneously with the pursuit of the policy which is our present policy, and which is conditioned by our obligations with regard to the distant Dominions of the Crown. If that ever changes, then would arise the possibility to which the noble Earl has referred. The reason why I carefully guarded myself from pointing in that direction in the speech to which he has referred was the reason which I have given to-day. I think I have now made it clear that there was no deep-lying or sinister intention in the speech I made at Barnstaple, and I confess, having read that speech over again&#x2014;a thing I very rarely do with my own speeches&#x2014;I am very much puzzled to understand how such an idea could have got into the noble Earl's head.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02353"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the debate this afternoon has been particularly interesting in that we have had an opportunity, which is rare in this House, of hearing the two noble Lords who were responsible for the introduction of the Territorial Army scheme&#x2014;one pointing out the weakness of the scheme, and the other defending the scheme. The noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War has rather talked round the point which I feel sure many of your Lordships would like to get at&#x2014;namely, whether the Expeditionary Force is actually there and able to sail. The noble Viscount said there was no contemplation of any policy of a great Army on a Continental basis. I do not suppose that any of us imagined for a moment that there was. But is it possible that this Expeditionary Force, of which we hear so much, can be sent out
<col>1040</col>
of the country? Through the policy which His Majesty's Government have adopted in regard to the land defences of the country they always find themselves on the horns of the same dilemma. They talk very largely about the Expeditionary Force, and for the purposes of this Force all the officers are counted in. But when it comes to a question of home defence these unfortunate officers are counted over again. I should like to ask, in the first place, whether we have the organisation to send out the Expeditionary Force; and, secondly, whether we can afford to let it go. The noble Viscount ought to tell us at some time or another whether the policy of His Majesty's Government is the policy laid down by Sir Edward Grey, or the policy which I read into the noble Viscount's speech&#x2014;that we cannot compete on the Continent with the great Continental armies.<lb/>
Every day that passes we see less and less hope of the Expeditionary Force being able to set sail. The noble Duke behind me pointed out the other day the lamentable state of things in regard to officers in the Special Reserve. If I read <i>The Times</i> report of the noble Duke's speech correctly, he stated that there would be practically no subalterns at all in the Special Reserve at the moment that the Expeditionary Force is to sail. I understand that for this integral part of our home defence officers are to be improvised after the Expeditionary Force has left these shores. I notice that the noble Viscount dissents from that. But, according to him, 'we shall be 1,100 officers short in the 74 battalions, and we are to make up for 600 of them by getting boys from Sandhurst. Youths with only six months' training at Sandhurst or Woolwich are to be pitchforked among a number of men they have never seen, and perhaps at the moment before action. You are to make up 600 officers of cadets. What are the remainder going to consist of? The noble Viscount spoke of two or three hundred "patriotic gentlemen" who are to come forward. God help those men! They will indeed be patriots to join an army which is going to be organised in this manner. In the noble Viscount's own words, there will be 1,100 subalterns short at the moment of mobilisation. Therefore I ask the question again, Can this Expeditionary Force sail, or can it not? And is there any intention that it
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0546"/>
<col>1041</col>
should ever sail? All sorts of attempts have been tried to get out of this. We were told by the noble Marquess the Leader of the House some two years ago that Continental operations were outside the scope of the Government's ideas&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02354"><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Has the noble Lord the reference to what I said?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02355"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: No, I have not; but I will give it to the noble Marquess afterwards. Then we had the statement that only four out of the six Divisions would sail. And afterwards we were told that only three were going to sail, the authority for that statement being Lord Lucas. Then we had a statement in the other House of Parliament by the Under-Secretary, who produced plans by which the six Divisions could get under sail within fifteen days. If they are going to fight on the Continent and fight with success they must be on the spot somewhere between the fourteenth and the fifteenth day. The great battle would take place between the eleventh and the twenty-fifth day, and unless we had our Expeditionary Force there in time for the great action we might as well not send it at all. Our bagatelle of troops would be nothing to a defeated army on the Continent, but it might make all the difference if our Expeditionary Force arrived in time. I trust that some noble Lord on the Front Bench opposite will give us further enlightenment on this point, and let us know what the policy of His Majesty's Government is and whether they can send this Expeditionary Force oversea if circumstances arise which make it desirable that we should send it for the support of our ally.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02356"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think the question put by the noble Lord who has just sat down is a fair one, but your Lordships are in some difficulty over the Notice on the Paper. The noble Earl, Lord Portsmouth, put down a most innocent looking interrogatory, and on that he has founded a speech which in reality goes into the whole question of the external relations of this country, and, in addition, raises in a very definite form the desirability of our adopting compulsion for military service. I am under a difficulty which I think a good many of your Lordships are under in that we had not the advantage of reading the speech
<col>1042</col>
which the noble Viscount delivered at Barnstaple. I have tried hard to get a copy, but have not been able to discover what this epoch-making speech actually alleged. But to a great extent we are relieved from that difficulty, by the speech to-day of the noble Viscount, who has practically ranged himself in line with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. I can only say that we on this side of the House congratulate ourselves that the noble Viscount has taken that attitude. If there was anything in the Barnstaple speech which appeared to differ from the attitude of the Foreign Secretary, we are obliged to Lord Portsmouth for having succeeded in obtaining so reassuring a statement as we have had this afternoon from the noble Viscount. The only thing I think we are entitled to say, after that statement, is that that announcement of policy, that clear abandonment of the isolation of this country, the adoption of the policy of alliances, does involve a corresponding obligation and liability on the Secretary of State for War.<lb/>
What I think your Lordships in these discussions sometimes find so difficult is to disentangle the interchange of criticism and recrimination as to the past as against the present, and as to our alleged strength and our real strength. What seems to me to be the really important issue is this. Is the policy of His Majesty's Government such as involves a heavier charge and liability on the country than was the case seven years ago? And still more, Have circumstances altered in relation to our possible antagonists in such a way as make the professions of the Government more difficult to carry out than they were some years back? I for one do not shrink from these comparisons of strength as against a few years ago, because I believe that the state of our Forces as we handed them over in the then circumstances of the time was absolutely defensible, indeed in some respects a good deal more defensible than would be the case under similar circumstances at the present moment. But I think we ought to keep clearly in our mind that the obligations and dangers of 1912 are very different from the obligations and dangers of 1905. There has been a great change in the comparative power of Fleets, of our own Fleet as compared with foreign Fleets. We know that the two-to-one standard was then adopted, and we know now that
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0547"/>
<col>1043</col>
His Majesty's Government have not found it possible to work up to so high a standard. There has been also a great change in policy. Upon this matter the noble Marquess asked for the reference to his speech which was alluded to by Lord Lovat. I have a perfect recollection of that speech, in which the noble Marquess told us that we did not expect so to organise our military forces as to enable us to employ them on the Continent of Europe. The change which was made last year was, I venture to say, an epoch making change, and especially so coming from the Benches opposite. There is also, I am afraid I must say, too, in this relation a considerable decrease in our offensive power in certain particulars, especially in the case of Artillery and of officers. What I really ask for, in supporting what has just fallen from Lord Lovat, is that we should get on all these subjects rather more chastened information than we have had in the past.<lb/>
I do not wish to accuse the noble Viscount of any desire to do otherwise than give the House absolutely reliable information, and I am not going either to follow out the question of whether we can defend ourselves at present without compulsion, which was raised by the noble Earl, or even the question of whether six Divisions could be sent abroad at the present moment, but I am going to lay down two things which I hope your Lordships will take note of, and which I think the country ought to study. The first is that the policy of the Government has changed completely in the last three years with regard to the number of troops they would send abroad in the contingency of there being a European foe by whom we might apprehend invasion. This point was put over and over again to the Government in a debate about three years ago, and in the end we had a direct statement from the noble Marquess the Leader of the House. We pressed the Government on this point. We said, "You can make up six Divisions somehow, no doubt. If you do, you will, in our opinion, leave behind forces quite unfit to use against a European army. Will you, in these circumstances, send six Divisions abroad?" The noble Marquess, after the fullest deliberation and after the question had been put by four different speakers on this side, stated that if there was anything like a danger of invasion, if there was anything to apprehend, unless
<col>1044</col>
the sky, so to speak, was clear in that respect, the Government did not propose to send more than four Divisions abroad.<lb/>
In certain circumstances last year the Government, as we all know, found it necessary to contemplate sending abroad the whole of the six Divisions which were said to constitute our Expeditionary Force. That involves a complete change in the situation in regard to home defence, because the whole of the Government's scheme rests upon their having six months in which to prepare forces for home defence. That six months would be taken away, and my noble friend Lord Lovat was anxious to pursue the question and to know whether or not, in the circumstances, the six Divisions could go. I have my own opinion about that, and I believe that, one way or another, they would go. I believe that the organisation for sending them is in a far better state. I am not quite so sure about the stores, and the noble Viscount has not been so reassuring on that point. I should like to know a little more as regards the reserves of stores for that occasion, of course assuming that a sufficiency is left behind for home defence.<lb/>
A dangerous feature in all the assumptions of the noble Viscount is that regiments at home will have to be wrecked in order that the six Divisions may be sent abroad in complete form. The noble Viscount stands first on one leg and then on the other, and expects us to believe that in each case he is resting his whole frame on both. I have here the remarks which he made on March 6 last and the remarks which he made two nights ago, in reply each time to the noble Duke. The noble Duke's point is this. He says, "You may be able to send the six Divisions, but you are going to take practically every subaltern out of the Special Reserve. You give Regular officers to the Special Reserve and you say the Special Reserve will not be efficient without those officers, yet you are going to take the whole lot away on mobilisation." On March 6 I asked the noble Viscount what number of officers who would go abroad would have to be taken from the Officers Training Corps, the noble Duke having said that 600 of them would be officers of the Special Reserve. The noble Viscount replied&#x2014;I am quoting from <i>Hansard</i>&#x2014;
<quote>"You would not, at any rate to any large extent, take officers from the Officers Training Corps of
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0548"/>
<col>1045</col>
the Special Reserve for that purpose. What you would do would be to draw upon the Regular officers belonging to the other establishments at home. There are 780 of them with the Special Reserve battalions. You would make your Expeditionary Force as perfect in officers as possible."</quote>
That is a definite statement that from the 780 Regular officers with the Special Reserve battalions will be drawn the officers necessary to bring the six Divisions up to strength on mobilisation. Two nights ago the noble Duke made a very damaging case as to the condition of these regiments if officers were to be taken away in this manner, and the noble Viscount then used these words&#x2014;
<quote>"All the Regular officers belonging to the Special Reserve establishment in peace will remain with them on mobilisation."</quote>
That is an absolute divergence of statement. I do not for a moment suggest that the noble Viscount deliberately intends to mislead the House. But when the attack is that the six Divisions cannot go, he tells us that he can draw on the Special Reserve and take away their Regular officers for that purpose; and when the attack is that the Special Reserve will be perfectly useless because it will have no subalterns of experience in it, he says that the whole of them will be left for home defence. A man cannot be in both places at the same time. I am not going to ask your Lordships to go more deeply into this question to-night, but I have deprecated on previous occasions and I deprecate now the system under which the noble Viscount, who is trying to make bricks without straw, endeavours to prove to us that all the bricks will be forthcoming at the time of mobilisation. We are not in the least averse to helping the noble Viscount in his difficulty if he has any. We do not in the slightest degree complain of the firm language which has been used in certain foreign difficulties recently, but we do complain that the Government will not tell the country what sacrifices may be necessary in order to make that firm language effective.<lb/>
There is, the noble Viscount must know, one serious grievance amongst officers in this country. I have long been of opinion that it is impossible to fill the ranks of officers unless you pay a living wage. Army subalterns are worse paid, in my opinion, than any other body of men in this country, except, perhaps, those who go into the Church. While other trades and pursuits have been more highly
<col>1046</col>
remunerated, I do not think there has been any improvement in the position of the subaltern officer in the Army for a great number of years. For a long time the argument used to be&#x2014;I remember hearing Lord Randolph Churchill make use of it in a speech in the House of Commons&#x2014;that it was absurd to talk of adding to the pay of officers in the Army. The great mistake, said Lord Randolph, was to pay them anything at all; they were quite willing to join for the honour of serving the Queen, and it was absolutely unnecessary, he said, to consider the question of pounds, shillings, and pence. That is not the case now, and, considering the lavish expenditure into which this Government has been plunged, I do say that before we desert the idea of voluntary service and before we say that Regular officers cannot be obtained in sufficient numbers we ought to consider whether the inducements offered to them ought not to be improved.<lb/>
I add the pious hope that, with these strong pronouncements of policy, we may be allowed some insight into the difficulties and, what is really more important for the remedying of them, some admission that there are difficulties now that the policy of the Government includes sending six Divisions abroad immediately without the six months' delay for training, and now that the Government themselves must realise that there are difficulties, not anticipated by the noble Viscount five years ago, in filling up the ranks, not merely to the numbers which now ought to be there in case of invasion, but to the numbers which then, under much more favourable circumstances, he said were the minimum on which he could contemplate the efficient defence of the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02357"><member>THE EARL OF ERROLL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to say a word in support of what has fallen from the noble Viscount as to the necessity of paying officers better. In every other walk of life when men are wanted higher wages are offered and the men are generally obtained, but during the last 100 years I believe the pay of officers has been almost stationary while that of the men has been very much increased. It seems to me that the British officer at the present moment is the worst paid in the world. You give him the wages of an artisan or of one of your
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0549"/>
<col>1047</col>
Lordships' butlers, and you expect for that to get an educated gentleman to Rive his services to the country. I should like to read to your Lordships a comparison with what is paid to officers in America and in Australia, and you will see how very much worse off are the officers in this country. I gave these figures to your Lordships four years ago, but since that time I believe nothing has been done.<lb/>
A second-lieutenant in the British Army gets the princely wage of&#x00A3;95 a year; in Australia, apparently, there are no second-lieutenants; but in America a second-lieutenant receives&#x00A3;280 a year. A lieutenant in the British Army gets&#x00A3;118 a year; in Australia he gets&#x00A3;200, rising by&#x00A3;25 a year to&#x00A3;300; and in the American Army he gets&#x00A3;300. A captain in the British Army receives&#x00A3;211; in the Australian Army a captain receives from&#x00A3;325 to&#x00A3;400; and in the American Army&#x00A3;360. Majors receive in this country&#x00A3;247 a year; in Australia they get from&#x00A3;425 to&#x00A3;500, and in America&#x00A3;500. Lieutenant-colonels receive here&#x00A3;328 a year; in Australia they get from&#x00A3;500 to&#x00A3;600, and in America&#x00A3;600. These figures show that the Colonies recognise the justice of giving a fair day's pay for a fair day's work, and that they treat their officers much more generously than we do. I cannot help thinking that there are plenty of young men in this country ready to come forward and officer the Army, young men who are absolutely suitable from their pursuits and their traditions to do so, but at the present moment I do not think the conditions offered are adequate to induce them to come forward in sufficient numbers. At present the rates of wages which you offer are too low, the prospects are hazy, and the plums are too few.</membercontribution></p>

That apparently harmless Question has grown into a discussion ranging over the whole field of foreign policy and Imperial

My noble friend, Lord Haldane, performed a service in the course of his speech in pointing out that these discussions are apt to be conducted with a certain laxity of language and without a perfectly clear understanding of what particular terms mean as we use them. He instanced the term "Oversea Forces." It is quite true that the term "Oversea Army" is used alike at different times for a force which has to take a long spell of service in tropical countries, and for the entirely different services which a British Army might conceivably be called upon to fulfil&#x2014;namely, that of serving on some part of the Continent of Europe. The battle of Assaye was fought overseas and so was the battle of Waterloo, but they were engagements of a totally different class, fought by the same General but with entirely different armies and under totally different conditions. It is important, I think, to keep this distinction clear in one's mind, because it has a real bearing upon the difficult and vexed question of compulsory service, which I quite agree this is not the moment to discuss in all its bearings, although it has, of course, a close reference to the subject under discussion.<lb/>
My noble friend behind me also pointed out that there are two extreme policies, both of which were repudiated in his speech and also in the speech of my right hon. friend Sir Edward Grey. On the one hand, there is the policy, which some people regard as an ideal policy for this country, of complete isolation, of remaining absolutely uninterested in what happens on the Continent of Europe, and of resolving that in no circumstances will you take part in any complication unless you are yourselves directly attacked. That is a policy which, as Sir Edward Grey pointed out and as my noble friend has also pointed out, it is riot possible for this country to pursue in existing circumstances, if indeed it ever was a possible policy for this country to maintain as an abstract proposition. Certainly it has never been maintained as a historical
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0550"/>
<col>1049</col>
fact. The alternative policy, of course, is the policy&#x2014;also repudiated by the noble Earl opposite&#x2014;of close alliance with great Continental Powers involving the performance of serious obligations on our part, perhaps in matters in which we have no real interest whatever.<lb/>
I was not quite certain what the noble Earl intended when he spoke of offensive and defensive alliances as being the kind of alliances which he thought we ought not to undertake. I was not quite certain whether he desired to hint that we might conceivably undertake a policy of defensive alliances as distinct from the universal obligation attached to offensive and defensive alliances, but I am sure the noble Earl will be aware that what is called a defensive alliance may, as a matter of fact, throw almost as heavy an obligation upon any Power as an alliance for all purposes; and for this reason, that where an attack is made by one Power on another, which is the really responsible party in the collision between the two Powers is a matter which in fact can only be decided by the ultimate verdict of history. It is a matter upon which it is hardly possible to give a sound opinion at the time. If the noble Earl would consider all the various wars that have taken place in which European Powers were concerned in the whole of the latter part of the nineteenth century, he would find on examination that in the case of almost all those collisions each side would have said that it was not the attacking but the attacked party. Consequently such a distinction as I could not help thinking the noble Earl meant to draw is one which in fact it is exceedingly difficult to make.<lb/>
The noble Lord opposite, Lord Lovat, alluded specially to the Expeditionary Force, and to some phrases of mine which I used, I think, about two years ago. As I stated earlier, I have not the precise reference to what I said, but I have no reason to think that I hold now a view in any way different from that which I held then; nor, which is infinitely more important, have I any reason to suppose that the policy of His Majesty's Government has in any way been modified since that time. If I remember aright, on that occasion an attempt was made to pin us to a statement that at a moment's notice, in all circumstances, whatever might be the condition of affairs on the Continent
<col>1050</col>
of Europe and whatever might be the threats which had been levelled against us, we should be prepared to send out six Divisions to some part of the world&#x2014;it is not important where&#x2014;but that we should be prepared at once to send them out of the country. At that time I stated, and I am quite prepared to state again, that the circumstances of Europe might be such that it would not be possible to send at short notice more than four Divisions out of the country.<lb/>
I am prepared to go further than that. I can conceive other circumstances in which it might not be possible to send more than two Divisions. I can conceive other circumstances in which it would not be possible to send a single man out of the country, and I have not the least doubt that there is not one of the great military Powers on the Continent of Europe which would not be able to make a similar declaration as to what might happen in special circumstances on the Continent of Europe. The fact is, my Lords, we have two forces which both exist primarily, of course, for purposes of defence, but are both capable of offence&#x2014;the first being the Fleet, and the second being that portion of our Army winch it is possible to send abroad. Without knowing what the precise circumstances are, what Powers are hostile to you in Europe at the time and what are friendly, what are their relations among themselves, and what is the position on the Continent of Europe in regard to alliances <i>inter se</i>&#x2014;without knowing all these things it seems to me altogether impossible to lay down as a general proposition that you are prepared either to send abroad 50,000, 100,000, or 150,000 men, or, in the course of time, the whole male population of this island which is capable of bearing arms.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02359"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: That is our point. We say you are not sufficiently strong at home to be able to make use of the Expeditionary Force in all circumstances.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02360"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I in no way dispute the conclusion which the noble Lord chooses to draw from the observations which I have made. It appears to me that it would apply equally well, as I have said, to every country in Europe. If it were at the time being engaged in a contest of a particular kind, it might not be able to send either part if its Fleet or a particular
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0551"/>
<col>1051</col>
part of its Army to a particular part of the world. You could, easily devise a case, I suppose, with regard to any of the great military Powers of Europe which have possessions abroad, in which it would be exceedingly difficult for them to send any troops abroad. It would not, I should think, be taken as a confession of weakness on the part of the German Army or of the French Army were they to admit freely that if they were engaged in a great European war on their frontiers they would not respectively desire to send, or even in a sense be capable of sending, 100,000 men in one case to South Africa and in the other case to Indo-China. It would be an entirely irrelevant question to put to those who control those armies to ask them if they could conceive any special circumstances in which they would not be able to move their men about the chess board in the manner in which they might move them supposing no complications existed. That being so, I am quite certain that my noble friend will not feel himself in any way pinned into a corner by the fact that he is obliged to admit that the precise number of men that can be sent away from this island at any particular moment must depend on the special circumstances of the case and primarily upon the issues of foreign policy.<lb/>
Some part of the speeches made has dealt with specially military questions of the character of those touched upon in the Questions of the noble Duke which are next on the Paper. I have no desire to attempt to play any of my noble friend's cards by dealing with those questions, which excite great interest, such, for instance, as that which was dealt with by the noble Earl who spoke last and was also touched upon by the noble Viscount opposite&#x2014;namely, the exceedingly important question of the pay of the British officer. Nor would there be any advantage in my attempting to deal with those other questions as to the supply of subalterns for the Expeditionary Force or for the Home Defence Force, which were touched upon by the noble Earl who initiated this debate and also by Lord Lovat. With some of those matters I have no doubt my noble friend the Secretary of State will be able to deal in his reply to the noble Duke's Questions. I have endeavoured to confine these observations simply to questions of policy, and to show, so far as I could, that the discrepancy alleged by the noble Earl
<col>1052</col>
between the observations of my noble friend and of the Foreign Secretary does not in reality exist, because although this country does not take up a position of complete isolation from all possible interests on the Continent of Europe, yet it is equally removed from the policy of the opposite pole&#x2014;that of entangling or embarrassing alliances.<lb/>
The noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, used the word "alliances." That could only have been a slip, because he is, of course, aware that no such alliance with any Great Power on the Continent of Europe exists. We have no engagements of any kind, as has often been stated, involving military obligations on our part. That has already been clearly stated by my right hon. friend, and in view of the character of this discussion and of the rather easy manner in which the possibility of moving large bodies of troops on to the Continent of Europe has been mentioned, it is desirable, I think, that that statement should be categorically made again. We have no entangling military alliance. But, as noble Lords opposite know very well, we have friendly understandings of an intimate character, and of the possible bearings of those understandings upon conceivable foreign complications noble Lords who keep their eye on the world at large are as competent to judge as we are, because the whole business is entirely above board. We have no secret engagements or obligations, and noble Lords opposite are entitled to figure for themselves, and are quite capable of doing so, the conceivable circumstances in which those understandings might lead&#x2014;which Heaven forbid should be the case&#x2014;to our interfering in some complications abroad. But I think that my noble friend made the matter, as far as he is concerned, quite clear, and I have done nothing more than to repeat what he said.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02361"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it appears to me&#x2014;I do not know whether I am mistaken or not&#x2014;that the noble Marquess has just dealt a mortal blow to the military policy of his colleague beside him. The keynote of that military policy, so far as I have understood it, is that this country, owing to the admirable arrangements which the noble Viscount had made, was in a position to send abroad 150,000 men whenever they were required in any conceivable contingency; and the Under-Secretary of State for War went so far
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0552"/>
<col>1053</col>
as to assert in the House of Commons the other day that he had only to address an envelope and the thing was done. Now we gather that in certain circumstances that are not altogether improbable the Government are not prepared to despatch a single man of the Expeditionary Force. I do not desire to offer any further comment upon that. I am not going to say anything on the general political situation, because I venture to think that without notice and on an impromptu occasion like this it is a very imprudent thing to discuss international relations. But I hope that at least the nation will realise what the military position of this country actually is. I do not know how this declaration will be taken abroad. I do not know how it will be taken in this country. But, at all events, I do feel convinced that anybody who studies the declaration which has just been made will come to the conclusion that the veil of optimism with which the noble Viscount has so successfully clothed his scheme up to the present moment is in rapid process of disappearing.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-02362"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member> rose to call attention&#x2014;

<li>(<i>b</i>) "In the Peninsular War we had to make up a deficiency of officers on mobilisation, and we promoted a large number of non-commissioned officers in those days."</li></ol></li>
<li>3. To ask the Secretary of State for War whether, on the mobilisation of the six Divisions of the Expeditionary Force, Regular officers attached to the Infantry of the Territorial Army will be re-posted to their Regular battalions in order to complete the number of Regular officers required.</li>
<col>1054</col>
<li>4. Whether it is the intention to promote from the non-commissioned rank to fill vacancies in the commissioned ranks before the embarkation of the Expeditionary Force, or subsequently during the progress of the campaign; and to move for Papers.</li></ol></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02363">The noble Duke said: My Lords, on mobilisation the Expeditionary Force will be short of 600 Regular Infantry officers, not including those required for Staff duties. To meet this deficiency the noble Viscount told us on March 6 that he has "1,571 Regular Infantry officers available&#x2014;namely, 780 Regular Infantry officers now doing duty in the Special Reserve and 791 belonging to the infantry of the Regular Reserve of Officers." I wish to test those figures. The first point is to discover the total shortage of Infantry officers in the Expeditionary Force when the requisite number are withdrawn for Staff duties. The requisite number is given in detail in "War Establishments, Part I, Expeditionary Force, 1912." "War Establishments" is a War Office manual published by authority. I find in that book that there are required for Brigade and Divisional Staff 48 officers; for transport, signalling, and machine gun, 3 officers per battalion&#x2014;234 officers; a total of 282. I do not propose to give the details, which would mean the reading of a page and a-half from this manual, but if the noble Viscount challenges these figures I have the detail here and shall ask to be allowed to read it in the course of my reply. Then comes aviation. This is not yet allowed for in "War Establishments." For aviation work 182 officers from all branches of the Army are required by Memorandum on Naval and, Military Aviation [Cd. 6,067]. Say that the Infantry contribute 50. That makes a total of 332. If, therefore, for Staff work 332 more Infantry officers are required, then the total deficit of Regular officers for the Infantry of the Expeditionary Force is 932. If we say, in round numbers, 900 Regular Infantry officers, we shall be well under the mark. Because this estimate does not include every Staff appointment, and it does not make any allowance for unfitness for active service. How is this deficiency of 900 Regular Infantry officers to be met on mobilisation?</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02364">The noble Viscount told us, on March 6 last, that he had 780 Regular officers
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0553"/>
<col>1055</col>
serving with the Infantry of the Special Reserve, and that he was going to draw upon them in the first place to make good the deficiencies in Regular officers with the Line. But the noble Viscount forgot., when he gave the figure of 780, that he had already withdrawn all Regular officers from the Fourth Battalions of the Special Reserve except the adjutants and quartermasters, and was left with 632 Regular officers in the Special Reserve Infantry. Now, out of this number field officers, quartermasters and adjutants are not available as company officers. There are available, by the Army List, in the 74 Third Battalions of the Special Reserve 358 Regular company officers, which is not quite the same as 780, being less than half. The noble Viscount wants 900; he has got 358, and is left with a shortage of 542. He then falls back upon the Reserve of Regular Officers. He told us, on March 6 last, that in the Reserve of Officers&#x2014;
<quote>"There were at present 791 Infantry officers after allowing 40 per cent. for officers who for various reasons may not be forthcoming. That figure by itself would wipe out his (the Duke of Bedford's) 575,"</quote>
that being the deficit excluding Staff.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02365">But what is the real state of the case here? There are available in the Regular Reserve of Officers, by the statement of the Under-Secretary of State for War on March 13, 129 Infantry captains and 38 Infantry subalterns who are resident in the United Kingdom, who do not belong to any other branch of our military forces, and who have left the Army less than three years&#x2014;a total of 167 to meet a deficit of 542, leaving a shortage of 375. It is impossible for the sate of efficiency to allow more than three years of complete rustiness to accumulate upon an officer who is to command a company in action within three weeks of rejoining&#x0021;Again, there is the point of age. It is useless to call back elderly captains to command Infantry companies on active service after they have "got slow." To sum up the noble Viscount's figures. He has told us that he had in the Special Reserve 780 Regular officers and in the Infantry of the Reserve of Officers, after allowing for all wastage, 791&#x2014;a total of 1,571 Regular officers available to make good deficiencies in the Infantry of the Expeditionary Force. But when we come to go into detail by reference to the Army List we
<col>1056</col>
find that, instead of 1,571 officers being available, we have 525&#x2014;that is, one-third of the number given by the noble Viscount. The deficit in the Expeditionary Force is 900; the number available for wiping out the deficit is not 1,571, it is 525, leaving a shortage of 375.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02366">The question I ask is, How does the noble Viscount, having exhausted all available Regular officers in the Special Infantry Reserve and in the Regular Reserve of Officers, propose to make good this shortage of 375 Regular Infantry officers previous to embarkation? To bring back a lot of rusty and elderly captains from the Reserve and put them in command of companies over the heads of senior subalterns fully qualified for the promotion which is due to them will not add to the efficiency of battalions. There are 129 captains to come back from the Reserve, so that it seems that on mobilisation companies to the numerical equivalent of sixteen battalions&#x2014;that is four Infantry Brigades&#x2014;will be commanded by Reserve captains. That is not desirable, although perhaps the best that can be done in the circumstances. But what is very much worse as far as efficiency goes as well as still more unfair to the Line subalterns is to bring in several hundred non-Regular officers from the Special Reserve. Bringing in non-Regular officers over the heads of Line officers previous to embarkation ought at all costs to be avoided; anyhow, the less of it the better. The effect of posting some hundreds of non-Regular captains and subalterns from the Special Reserve and Supplementary List of the Special Reserve to Line battalions on mobilisation is this. In the case of the captains, captains who have served fewer months consecutively than Line subalterns have years, and who have passed for their promotion under much easier terms, will step in and deprive the latter of the promotion due to them, for which they are qualified and to which the officers who go over their heads have no sort or kind of claim.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02367">In the case of lieutenants, first lieutenants from the Special Reserve will supersede second lieutenants in the Line. The Special Reserve first lieutenants on being posted to the Line on mobilisation, however much junior they may be, rank s<ob/> to all Regular second lieutenants however
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0554"/>
<col>1057</col>
much service they may have had. A first lieutenant from the Supplementary List of the Special Reserve who happens at his own convenience to have completed four separate fortnights of service, two months in all, will go over the head of a junior Line subaltern with nearly four years of consecutive service to his credit, and who has passed for the rank of first lieutenant in the Army. Now, as a former company officer in the Army I say at once that there is nothing I should have resented more keenly than a man who has avoided all the drudgery and hard work of military life in time of peace coming into my battalion over my head. An individual of one's own age, or very likely younger, and very probably a known failure to get into the Army, is to supersede you the moment it is a question of active service. This supersession of Regular officers by non-Regular officers on mobilisation destroys the Army as a professional career. The noble Viscount told us on March 6 last, "You would make your Expeditionary Force as perfect in officers as possible," and he proceeds to supersede the fit by the less fit, and that on the eve of active service.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02368">The noble Viscount, in dealing with the Army Estimates on March 14 of last year, said&#x2014;
<quote>"There is no difficulty at all in mobilising as far as officers of the Expeditionary Force are concerned. But, of course, you would deplete to a very considerable extent the dep&#x00F4;ts and home establishments."</quote>
I demur to the statement that there is no difficulty at all in mobilising as far as officers of the Expeditionary Force are concerned, but I entirely agree that the home establishments and the dep&#x00F4;ts must he depleted. But what does the noble Viscount mean exactly by the home establishments? On the departure of the Expeditionary Force we are left with four Regular battalions for the whole of Great Britain and Ireland and the Channel Islands. I presume that the noble Viscount does not propose to deplete these four borne battalions of their officers. But it would be satisfactory to have an assurance from him that he does not intend, to do so. Then as to the dep&#x00F4;ts. The noble Viscount cannot deplete the dep&#x00F4;ts because he has done that already. All Regular officers belonging to the dep&#x00F4;ts leave the depots of mobilisation with the Third Battalions of the Special Reserve, and we have already
<col>1058</col>
dealt with them. There is nothing left at the dep&#x00F4;in the way of Regular officers on mobilisation, and you cannot deplete nothing. But there is still a body of Regular Infantry officers left in the country&#x2014;namely, the adjutants of the Territorial battalions. There are 207 Regular infantry officers serving as adjutants of Territorial battalions. It is these officers, and not non-Regular officers, who should join the Expeditionary Force. Home Line battalions mobilising under great pressure for instant active service abroad are no place for non-Regular officers. With the best intentions in the world they will be more in the way than anything else, because they lack all knowledge and experience, in dealing with Regular non-commissioned officers and soldiers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02369">A battalion at home has been called by the noble Viscount a feeding battalion in the sense that it has to send drafts to its linked battalion abroad. If the feeding battalion is called upon to take the field within two or three months of having despatched all its drafts, then it is in the condition described by Lord Wolseley as that of a "squeezed lemon." When Lord Card well established the linked battalion system he most certainly never contemplated squeezed-lemon battalions being used within a fortnight of mobilisation for a great European campaign. He meant them for home defence. But His Majesty's Government, whether rightly or wrongly I do not know, are credited with having contemplated the possibility of using them last summer on the Continent of Europe. It is that which makes it especially interesting to consider in detail the composition of the battalions with which the Government were prepared to embark on a European campaign. In round numbers there will be available for each home battalion, after the departure of drafts abroad, 300 young soldiers with the Colours; consequently on mobilisation 600 Reservists will be required. First, as to the serving soldiers; most of these are boys of twenty years of age with little more than one year's training. They cannot be the equals of what are often referred to as Continental conscripts, who are men of not less than twenty-two years of age and none of whom will have done less than two years' training. Again, on the Continent the whole manhood of the nation is in the Army. You cannot say that Line recruits in this country
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0555"/>
<col>1059</col>
represent the manhood of the nation. It is idle to suppose that the boys serving with the Colours in the Infantry of the Expeditionary Force will not be outclassed in every respect by the Continental soldiers whom they will have to meet.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02370">Next we come to the Reserve. Now, we organise our Reserve on a different plan from that of Continental Powers. They train their Reserve officers and men annually with the units with which they did their Colour service and with which they will serve again on mobilisation. We do not. We do not train our Reserve, either officers or men, annually, and we post officers and men to units in time of war with which they have never served in time of peace. Our plan ensures our Reservists becoming more and more rusty with the lapse of each year spent in civilian life without any military training. Our Reserve is of varying quality&#x2014;from excellent to the reverse. The men in Section "A" who have done seven years' Colour service and have not been more than a year in the Reserve are probably the best trained Infantry soldiers in the world, but their numbers are limited. Some Reservists, and you must take the best, are required by Mobilisation Regulations, 1912, for Mounted Infantry duties in place of the Divisional Cavalry, which is lacking from the Expeditionary Force. But few of the serving boy soldiers would have been through a Mounted Infantry course, or would be strong enough to ride. They could not control one cob, let alone holding two or three others all unbroken to Mounted Infantry work. A boy cannot do a man's work in the Army any more than in any other field of labour. In the present Army Reserve many men have been passed prematurely to the Reserve after two or three years' Colour service. The exact number is known only to the Adjutant-General in the War Office. But what is known to every one outside the War Office is this, that men who have had two years' training with the Colours and spent many more, in the Reserve without any training at all are of no immediate value as first-class soldiers. Thus in the Regular Reserve you pass by degrees from excellence in Section "A" to uselessness amongst the re-enlisted Reservists in the last years of their service in Section "D."</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02371">The evidence given by many General Officers before the South African War
<col>1060</col>
Commission shows that Sections "A" and "B" of the Reserve proved most satisfactory on service, provided always they had had time to regain military habits, discipline, and proficiency. Field-Marshal Lord Methuen states that he found the Reserve efficient with the exception of the men in Section "D," who could not march and many of whom he had to leave behind. We rely, by the way, on Section "D" men for the Expeditionary Force. Lord Methuen adds that&#x2014;
<quote>"The difficulty with the Reserve is that when you bring them, as I did, up the Orange River and launch them against the enemy at once, they have hardly got to know their officers and non commissioned officers. Therefore I should say that to give a battalion a full chance the Reservists ought to be with the battalion a few weeks in the field before they are used."</quote>
Now the first-class Army Reserve was called up on October 7, and the Battle of Magersfontein was fought on December 11&#x2014;nine weeks after mobilisation. There had been mobilisation at home, the voyage out, the disembarkation, the march up the Orange River, but, even after that, the Reserve was not yet at its best. Now what chance is there of the Infantry of the Expeditionary Force having nine weeks previous to going into action on the Continent of Europe? The answer is none, absolutely none. The men will not have time to get used to their new boots much less their new rifles. The problem is how to attain the maximum of efficiency in a couple of weeks with a battalion composed of a collection of 300 young serving soldiers undoubtedly inferior to Continental soldiers, and 600 Reservists some of whom may be superior and others again inferior to the troops to whom they will be opposed. The degree of efficiency to which a battalion can attain under these circumstances within two or three weeks must depend entirely on the ability and experience of its officers and non-commissioned officers. Hence the necessity of employing none but Regular officers who know how to handle and deal with Regular soldiers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02372">The noble Viscount must summon the 207 Regular officers from the Territorial Army. We remember that in the early days of the Territorial Army the type of man to make an ideal Territorial adjutant was said to be a young solicitor. Could not the noble Viscount cause lists to be
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0556"/>
<col>1061</col>
prepared of young solicitors who would be ready to act as adjutants on the mobilisation of the Territorial Force, and thus set free Regular officers urgently required for more important duties abroad? No one has ever yet been able to explain the use of the Territorial Army. We have had many debates in your Lordships' House on this subject, all of which have intensified the obscurity. But this is clear&#x2014;if the Territorial Army is to endanger the initial success of the Regular Army in a Continental campaign by depriving it of Regular officers, then so surely the Territorial Army as an institution becomes at once a standing danger to the Empire. If the noble Viscount reports to the Army 207 adjutants from Territorial battalions, then there is still a deficit of 168 Regular officers to be made good from the Special Reserve and by promotion from the ranks. If the noble Viscount leaves the Regular officers with the Special Reserve battalions as he told us last Thursday, then it will be 168 <i>plus</i> 358&#x2014;that is, 526. The noble Viscount can make good that shortage by taking every Special Reserve subaltern from the Third Battalions&#x2014;there are at present 500 available&#x2014;and making good the further shortage by promotions from the ranks. But I have included the 207 adjutants from the Territorial Army. If the noble Viscount does not repost these Regular officers to their Line battalions, then he must make good the 207 by promotion from the ranks. As regards the Special Reserve officers I would venture to make this suggestion to the noble Viscount. Send none but subalterns to the Line previous to embarkation, and make all Special Reserve subalterns, whether they be first lieutenants or not, join at the bottom of the list of Regular officers as recruit officers. Let them join as they do now on passing for the Army. Why should the fact of not passing for the Array allow them on account of mobilisation to join senior to Line subalterns? You will thus avoid interfering with promotion in the Line, anyhow previous to the commencement of the campaign, whatever may happen afterwards.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02373">Then as to promotion front the ranks. On March 6 last the noble Viscount told us that&#x2014;
<quote>"In the Peninsular War we had to make up a deficiency of officers on mobilisation, and we promoted a large, number of non-commisioned officers in those days."</quote>
<col>1062</col>
Does the noble Viscount propose to promote from the non-commissioned ranks before the embarkation of the Expeditionary Force or during the progress of the campaign? I cannot find instances of noncommissioned officers promoted from the ranks previous to the commencement of the Peninsular War. Perhaps the noble Viscount would kindly inform me where the records can be found. During the campaign several non-commissioned officers were promoted for distinguished service in the field and were generally appointed adjutants in other regiments. The Under-Secretary of State for War stated, on March 12, that lists of non-commissioned officers qualified for commissioned rank had already beer prepared. It is impossible to tell if an officer, a non-commissioned officer, or a man will show distinguished ability on service. In the Peninsular War they tried non-commissioned officers in the field first and promoted them afterwards. The obvious disadvantage of promoting front the ranks on the eve of embarkation is that experienced noncommissioned officers are invaluable on mobilisation, and although the commissioned ranks may be strengthened the non-commissioned ranks must be weakened by being deprived of their best and most experienced members. It may be that promotion from the ranks on an extended scale at the moment of mobilisation may impair, and not add to, the total efficiency of battalions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02374">If the noble Viscount resorts to promotion from the ranks he must give those promoted a living wage. The pay of a second lieutenant is 5<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>. a day; that of a sergeant-major, 5<i>s</i>. But when a cadet joins from Sandhurst he is not as a rule a married man with a wife and six or eight children, which is generally the case with sergeant-majors and senior non-commissioned officers. The noncommissioned officer has his uniform, boots, and other articles of clothing provided, also his rations. Then he has free quarters for his wife and children, and when the battalion moves they travel at the public expense. The moment he is promoted to commissioned rank he loses all these allowances. I presume that this question of pay has been considered, and I hope the noble Viscount will give us some information upon the point. In conclusion, I hope that the noble Viscount will do as he told us he was going

<col>1063</col>
to do, namely, make the Expeditionary Force as perfect as possible in officers. But that entails depriving the Territorial Infantry of the Regular officers, and not superseding Regular officers by Special Reserve officers. I have avoided any reference to the wastage of war, as my remarks apply solely to the officers of the Infantry of the Expeditionary Force previous to embarkation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02375"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I confess that experience has now taught me to tremble when the noble Duke gives notice of a Question, because it branches out into a vast variety of topics. Much of what he said dealt with matters to which this Motion does not refer. For instance, the quality of the British Reservist as compared with the Continental Reservist. It is quite true that he is not trained during his Reserve period to the extent that some Continental soldiers are trained; but, on the other hand, the British Reservist has served seven years with the Colours and is a much better trained man initially than his Continental contemporary, and that is the reason why we lay less stress on training than is laid upon it on the Continent, where the Reserve period commences after two years' training. There were other topics to which the noble Duke referred, to even touch upon which I should be taking up a great deal of your Lordships' time. I will only refer to one. He said that aviation will require an increase in the establishment of officers. That is quite true. We shall have to recruit more officers to meet the demands which aviation is making, and we are proceeding to do so. Recruiting for that establishment will be added to the recruiting for the other establishments, and as aviation grows so we must get as many officers as we can for this work. It will be satisfactory to noble Lords opposite to know that the officers of the Flying Corps are on the whole well paid. We have seen to that. As regards non-commissioned officers who may be promoted, there, again, I can inform the noble Duke that we have anticipated what he said, and his observations have therefore not fallen upon deaf ears.<lb/>
Then the noble Duke went into a string of further figures, of which again I had no notice. If there belonged to your Lordships' House a noble Lord with the gifts of one of those marvellous youths to be seen in the music-halls in the capitals of this
<col>1064</col>
country and the Continent, who can perform astounding feats in impromptu calculation and carry in their heads strings of figures, he might be in a position to cope with the noble Duke; but I am wholly deficient in those gifts, and therefore I can only deal with the figures of which he has given me some notice, except where by chance I happen to carry some others in my head, which I fear is but rarely. The noble Duke spoke first of the deficiency of 600 Regular Infantry officers, excluding Staff, on the mobilisation of the Regular Infantry of the six Divisions of the Expeditionary Force. He asked what would be the deficiency, including, Staff. My answer to that is that the actual shortage in the Infantry battalions of the Expeditionary Force on March 1 last, after deducting the officers required for Staff and extra-regimental appointments, was 666. The number varies from day to day, and can no more be considered constant than the number of subalterns to be taken from each Special Reserve battalion. This number must depend on the requirements of the Regular units and on the strength in officers of the Special Reserve battalions. The authorities do not propose necessarily to take four officers from each Special Reserve battalion. If a particular Special Reserve battalion is considerably below-its establishment of subalterns, its strength may be left undisturbed.<lb/>
On Monday last I told the noble Duke that in all periods of history and in every country mobilisation must be a ragged business. The immense leap front peace to war establishment, in the case of officers in particular, is always trying, even in the most perfectly regulated armies. If the noble Duke found himself in Berlin he would probably hear complaints, almost as loud and long as his own, of the system which they have there, although it is a better system, owing to their circumstances, than we have here. The actual method of filling the deficiencies in the Expeditionary Force must be determined at the time and in the circumstances of the moment, having regard to what the number may be when the need arises. Then the noble Duke called attention to what I said on March 6. I then said that what we should do would be to draw upon the Regular officers belonging to other establishments at home. The noble Viscount opposite has also called attention to that sentence. But meantime&#x2014;on Monday last
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0558"/>
<col>1065</col>
&#x2014;I explained what I meant. I said that we should draw on the Regular establishments at home, but that that was not to be taken as meaning that we should mop up all the officers, or the greater part of them. We have no intention of taking away the Regular officers with the Special Reserve units. We have no intention of depriving the Territorial Force of its Regular officers, of its adjutants and so on. I do not think the noble Duke displayed any love for the Territorial Force in the suggestion which he made to me on that point. But I can assure noble Lords that as regards the Territorial Force our virtue is proof, as it is in the case of the Special Reserve, so far as regards Regular officers. In the course of the development of mobilisation schemes it has been found that it is not desirable that we should draw Regular officers from any establishments at home except the Staff College and other establishments which would naturally be closed on mobilisation. As I explained on Monday, we do not propose to draw away the Regular officers with the Special Reserve battalions or the Regular officers with the Territorial Force.<lb/>
Then I explained that it is our intention to promote a number of non-commissioned officers on mobilisation, and we have made provision for proper remuneration for them. It is intended to give commissions to a number of non-commissioned officers to fill vacancies in the Expeditionary Force prior to its embarkation, and this source of supply may subsequently be drawn upon also to meet the wastage of war. While non-commissioned officers are very valuable, this is not an aspect in which the Army is deficient. We have always been able to maintain great elasticity in the supply of non-commissioned officers, and the Reserve is sufficiently large to enable us to make up the slight depletion which the promotion of these non-commissioned officers would occasion. I have now answered all the points as to which the noble Duke interrogated me in his Questions. I am wholly unable to cope with the torrent of figures which he poured out in his speech and to which no reference is made in his Notice on the Paper; and. I can only say again that if he wants information about these figures, many of which go into great detail, the best plan would be for him to come and see us at the War Office and we will supply him with all the in-

We should avoid doing anything which would injure the efficiency of the Territorial Force.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02382"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: We wish to find out where these officers are coming from.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02383"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord ought to know that it is contrary to the practice of every country but our own to give even as much information as I have given regarding mobilisation. The noble Lord's experience must show him that it is not in the public interest to probe far into mobilisation details.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02384"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: I decline to accept the reference to other Continental Powers. The noble Viscount said that there was equal anxiety in Berlin. Germany has a reserve of officers under the rank of major numbering 28,000; and France, I believe, has a reserve of officers of about 17,000. Therefore we have in this country every right to be anxious and to desire to pin the noble Viscount down to every single thing we can get cut of him. Moreover, a good many of our officers appear in two places. They appear in the Army List both as officers of the Territorial Force and in the Reserve of Officers. I should like to ask whether any of these can be taken away to serve with the Expeditionary Force on mobilisation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02385"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: Do you mean Regular officers?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02386"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: I mean officers who have been Regular officers and who are now serving in the Territorial Force.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0559"/>
<col>1067</col>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02387"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: I should say certainly if the interests of the country required it. In those circumstances it would be right to take them. They are not Regular officers in the sense in which I have spoken. They are officers who have been Regular officers and who have become Territorial officers, but who are still under obligation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02388"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: I do not dispute the noble Viscount's wisdom in saying that he might take these officers away, but I wish to press home this fact, that the Territorial Army is to be depleted at the time of the mobilisation of the Expeditionary Force of its most efficient men. Thus the training of the Territorial Force will be deprived of its backbone. The noble Viscount said that he did not tie himself to take any particular number of officers from any of the Special Reserve regiments. All the Special Reserve regiments are short, I think, with only three or four exceptions. The inference, therefore, is that they will be entirely denuded of subalterns.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02389"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: Most of these officers who have served long enough to get a pension and are now in the Territorial Force are senior officers and of captain's standing, at all events, and there is no deficiency in officers of that sort. The General Reserve of Officers contains officers liable to serve in that rank in abundance. The difficulty is in junior subalterns, and to supply these we have called into existence the Officers Training Corps, which, as I explained the other day, now consists of 25,000, and some 18,000 have passed through it having obtained either the "A" or "B" certificate. We believe that the Corps will give us a large supply. As regards the rest, the promotion of non-commissioned officers, which the noble Lord opposite seemed to think a bad system&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02390"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: No. What I said was that it is a bad system at the moment of mobilisation; in fact, at the moment of mobilisation it is an infamous system.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02391"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: it is, at any rate, resorted to in France, and it is only not resorted to in Germany because of that large reserve of officers to which I referred last Monday. On mobilisation
<col>1068</col>
we have to do the best we can. It is only by making use of such means as the Universities and public schools afford that we can deal with the subject, and it is not made any better by probing too minutely into details.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02392"><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member><membercontribution>: I regret that the noble Viscount will not harden his heart and take the 500 or 600 Regular Infantry officers whom he proposes to leave at home with the Territorial Force. They would be valuable for the Infantry of the Expeditionary Force. The noble Viscount has not told me where I can find the record of commissions granted before the sailing of the Army for the Peninsular War.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02393"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: I will make inquiries among those who are learned in these things, and if I can get any light on the subject I will communicate with the noble Duke. As to the question of the desirability of taking away Regular officers from the Territorial Force, the noble Duke must fight that out with the noble Lord (Lord Lovat) who sits below him.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0011P0-02419"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (THE MARQUESS OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have the honour to move that an Address be presented to His Majesty to express the sorrow of this House at the loss which he and the Royal Family have sustained, and I also move that a similar Address be presented to Her Majesty Queen Alexandra on this sudden calamity which has befallen her. The personality of his late Majesty the King of Denmark was not very familiar in this country, less so perhaps than that of his illustrious father, who occupied the Throne of Denmark for so many years, but those who had had the privilege of meeting His Majesty will retain an impression of soldierly dignity accompanied by an unusual measure of geniality and kindness. We offer our respectful condolences to His Majesty the King, who has suffered more than an ordinary share of domestic bereavements since his Accession to the Throne, and we also offer them to our much-tried Queen Alexandra, who has had so many sorrows to bear. Her Majesty has been so entirely identified with English life, and has so completely shared all our national troubles and rejoicings that we might be tempted to forget&#x2014;though I am certain we do not forget&#x2014;that her affection for the home of her childhood has remained altogether unimpaired. I venture to think that if anything could add to the feelings of devotion and respect with which Her Majesty is regarded in this country, it would he that fact, because to everybody in this country it has been known that the happy home circle of the Court at Copenhagen has always supplied a model to those in exalted station. We have regarded with interest the affectionate family gatherings which have been held there during so many years, and we have admired the fine simplicity of life at that Court, a simplicity, indeed, which is illustrated by the particular circumstances of the deplorable event upon which we are offering our condolences to their Majesties to-day. In offering these condolences to His Majesty and to the Royal Family, and also to Queen Alexandra, we may be allowed, I trust, to express the respectful hope that His Majesty King Christian of Denmark may enjoy a long and prosperous reign over a nation for whom we feel such warm sympathy and
<image src="S5LV0011P0I0562"/>

friendship as we do for the people of Denmark.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0011P0-02420"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My 
Lords, upon this sad occasion we are on this side of the House well content that the noble Marquess who leads the House should be regarded as the spokesman of the whole House, and not of one side of it alone. A friendly nation has been deprived prematurely of a Sovereign greatly endeared to his people at the end of an altogether too short reign. The late King of Denmark enjoyed the esteem of his subjects, no doubt in great measure owing to the amiability of his disposition, but also, no doubt, because he had known how to preserve consistently the attitude of a Constitutional Sovereign, and that in the midst of circumstances that were at times of a somewhat perplexing character. I think it is also, no doubt, the case, as the noble Marquess has told us, that the great simplicity of the late King's character helped to secure for him the affection of his subjects, a simplicity which characterised not only the whole of his life, but its closing hours. But, my Lords, we think of the late King of Denmark not only as the Ruler of his own people, but as the kinsman of our Royal Family, united to this country by many close ties. I do not think it is any exaggeration to say that the attachment of this country to Denmark&#x2014;to the people of Denmark and to the Royal House of Denmark&#x2014;has been of a specially close and intimate character ever since the memorable day when, nearly fifty years ago, a Danish Princess arrived on these shores to be the Consort of one British Sovereign and the mother of another. She came here also to establish over all British hearts an empire which neither time nor vicissitudes have been able to shake or to impair. It is in these circumstances that we desire to offer our sympathy to His Majesty the King, to those members of the Royal Family who with the King are mourning for the loss which they have sustained, and above all to Queen Alexandra, to whom, besides her great and overwhelming sorrow of two years ago, the last few years have brought so much domestic bereavement. My Lords, I gladly second the Motion which the noble Marquess has submitted to the House.</membercontribution></p>
