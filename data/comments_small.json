{"date": ["1803", "nov", "22"], "content": "&#x2014;Sir, In rising to second the motion of my honourable friend, I find a considerable degree of embarrassment; not proceeding so much from the apprehension of addressing this House, whose indulgence I have before experienced, hut from the momentous crisis in which I am permitted to address you. A crisis, Sir, which whether we consider the general situation of the continent of Europe, sunk and depressed as it is by the predominant influence of one power to the rank and level of a petty German State, or whether we consider the particular situation of this kingdom rearing its head above those clouds of anarchy and despotism which have in succession shed their noxious influence on the globe: in whatever light we view, it, I believe it is a crisis unparalleled in the history of antient, and I am confident unequalled in that of modem times.&#x2014;At a period like the present. Sir, when preparations are making, the avowed object of which we know to be the destruction of this country, when even at the moment in which I am now speaking, the mediated attack may possibly have commenced on our coasts, I am sure I need not call upon the members of this House for that unanimity on which our salvation depends. Small indeed, I am well aware, is the influence which any argument of mine would produce, but I rely with confidence on the unanimous vote of the House in support of the motion of my honourable friend, because the experience of the last session of Parliament has taught me, that whatever shades of difference there might be in political opinions on speculative or theoretical points, however gentlemen might disagree in their sentiments of past measures, or of proposed plans of defence, yet, whenever the welfare of the King, the country, or the constitution, was at stake, this House possessed but one opinion and one voice.&#x2014;Let us, then, at the commencement of a session, during which it is probable the fate of this country will be decided, set an exam-18ple of unanimity to the British empire; let us not by dissentions here paralyze the efforts which a generous and patriotic enthusiasm is making for the preservation of the country.&#x2014;If, Sir, any argument was necessary in favour of unanimity, from what source could I deduce it better, than from the disunion, the selfish politics, and the lust of partial aggrandizement, which have deluged Europe with blood, and involved the innocent and guilty in one common ruin.&#x2014;But, Sir, I feel no apprehension of the want of unanimity, either within these walls or without. The moderation which his Majesty invariably shewed throughout the whole of the last war, the disposition which he at all times manifested to conclude a peace on fair and honourable terms, and the opportunity of which he availed himself to accept proposals of peace as soon as they were offered, have convinced the people of the necessity of the present war, and have united them in the prosecution of it. I fear not the want of courage in the people, or of vigour in the Government; but there is a circumstance from winch I confess I do entertain some apprehension; because, if the threatened attack is postponed to a more distant period, it may diminish the energy of the people, and may induce them to despise that danger, which I wish them to view alike without contempt or without dismay; it is from that improvident and overweening security which pervades many parts of the country. There is a language which I frequently hear used, which is in my opinion of so pernicious a tendency, that I have always thought it my duty, both as a magistrate and a man, to re-probate and refuse it. It is a very common phrase in all parts of the kingdom, to which I think every gentleman who now hears me can bear witness, that our present alarms are imaginary, that Buonapart&#x00E9; is as well convinced of the impossibility of invading this country a we are, that his preparations are only meant to alarm us, and to involve us in a ruinous expense. Now, Sir, if those who hold this language would consider the character of the enemy with whom we are to contend, if they would recollect that he invaded Egypt, and carried his arms further in that country than European troops had ever I penetrated before, at a time when he was engaged in a war with all Europe; if they would consider the armament which covers the coast of France from the Texel to the Bay of Biscay; if they would recollect that he has hitherto invariably attempted whatever he has threatened; that humanity, which forms a barrier to the ambition of other men, is no obstacle to his views; that of so small19estimation is life itself in his mind, that the sacrifice of thousands nay of whole armies, is no impediment to Ins progress; if they would reflect on these circumstances, I think they could not for a moment doubt, that he will attempt the invasion which he has threatened What the event of that attempt will be, it is not for human wisdom to foresee, but this it may be fair to predict; that if, like the Swiss, the Dutch, or the Hanoverian?, we wait, in a torpid or two confident security, until the enemy is at our gates, we shall share the fate of those unhappy countries; but if, on the contrary, we go forth with the spirit and the souls of Britons, to meet hire on our coasts; if we unite with one heart, and one hand, in defence of our country, we shall drive him back, with disgrace and discomfiture, to those who have raised him to the tyranny he usurps; where, like the Arch Fiend of old, he will return to his Pandemonium, and hear,On all sides, from innumerable tongues,A dismal, universal hiss&#x2014;the soundOf public scorn.But, Sir, whatever may be the final issue of this contest; however glorious its termination may be to Great Britain, I shall always regret the revolution which it has produced in the manners and constitution of every state in Europe. For, Sir, the habits, perhaps the prejudices, of my education, have taught me to look with a jealous eye on every increase of military power; and I grieve to think, that while the military despotism of France exists, every nation must rely, for the protection of its liberties, not on its civil constitution, but or; its military force. But, Sir, while ibis evil does exist, for I must call it an evil, though, I admit it to be a necessary evil, I rejoice to see the hands in which arms are placed, rejoice to see a rank and file of property, I rejoice that arms are intrusted to those who will be induced by interest, as well as by principle, to use them in support of the laws and constitution of their country. Let me, Sir, draw ii contrast between the military force of the two nations: in the one I see the wretched conscript dragged in chains to fight the battles of his tyrant; in the other see free and independent volunteers rushing in such numbers, that it is necessary tore-strain their ardour, and impossible to supply all of them with arms, to the defence of whom? Of the father of his people, the King of a free country, of the sovereign who comes20forth on this, day, and pledges himself to his people, that, in the hour of peril, he will share their exertions and their dangers with them, in defence of our constitution, in defence of our religion, in defence of the laws and independence of his dominions.&#x2014;Sir, T have purposely avoided entering into a detail of the different subjects I touched upon in his Majesty's speech, because my hon. friend has dilated upon them I in so ample and so clear a manner, that I am apprehensive of weakening the effect of his argument, by endeavouring to illustrate them. Gratitude, however, forbids my passing over in silence, the conduct of the British Navy. Of splendid achievements, indeed, the enemy has given them no opportunity; but the patience and perseverance with which they have continued to block up the ports of France, and the vigilance with which they have watched the motions of the enemy, so that I do not believe the smallest boat has escaped their notice, deserves our highest commendation. The conduct of the hon. Admiral, who commands the Channel fleet, in persevering to hold his station on the coast of France, in defiance of the storms and tempests incident to the season of the year, is above all praise.&#x2014;I regret, Sir, that I cannot look back to the events which have taken place in Ireland with equal satisfaction. But though the seeds of rebellion have again germinated in that country, yet they have sprung from so weak a root, they have been cultivated by so unskilful a hand, and have been cut-down at so early a period, by the vigilance of government, that I would willingly flatter myself the time is approaching when they will be finally eradicated. If, Sir, we may believe the dying declarations of the leaders of the insurrection, even they were not sunk so low, as to wish for a connection with France, or to be insensible to the horrors of French fraternity; and the trials have evinced, that the deluded people who joined them, were influenced more by former engagements, and oaths imposed on them, than by any conviction of the justice or advantage of the cause they espoused.&#x2014;I have already occupied so much of the time of the house, that I will not enlarge on the wound which we have inflicted on the foreign possessions of the enemy; while we have detained their fleets, blockaded in their own harbours, and' scarce suffered a single gun-boat to skulk from port to part. At any other period those conquests would have been considered as an adequate compensation for the21expenses of a war; but the splendor of these victories is, in some degree, lost, by the very circumstance which ought to make it more grateful to us, because they have been gained without bloodshed; and because the people of these colonies have voluntarily sought the protection of a government, whose mild and beneficent sway, they had before experienced.&#x2014;Sir, I am now to thank the house for the indulgence which they have shewn, and the patience with which they have permitted me to state my reasons for supporting an address, which L trust will meet the unanimous approbation of this house, because I believe it speaks the feelings of every subject of the British empire.", "author_id": "/people/mr-john-burland", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

{"date": ["1803", "dec", "12"], "content": "rose to move the second reading of theIrish Habeas Corpus Suspension Bill.&#x2014;His lordship began his speech by stating to the House, that though it might not be exactly in order, he should, with the view of facilitating any discussion which might take place, introduce any observations which occurred to him to be necessary to justify the motion for the second reading of theIrish Martial Law Bill, which would follow the motion for the second reading of the bill now before the House. He felt himself authorized in pursuing this course, more particularly when he considered, that the same arguments which would convince their lordships of the necessity and expediency of the one bill, would be equally applicable to the re-enactment of241the other. The circumstances which rendered the renewal of both bills necessary and expedient were now so similar to those under which they had been renewed at former periods, that he did not feel it his duty to trouble their lordships at any great length. When, however, he rose to propose any measure of such magnitude as that now before the House; when he rose to move for the renewal of bills which, to a certain degree, suspended the ordinary privileges of the constitution among a very considerable proportion of the population of the united empire, he certainly considered it incumbent on him to give some explanation of the grounds on which he called on their lordships to vest the ministers of the crown with these extraordinary powers. He trusted that their lordships had seen nothing in the conduct of his Majesty's ministers which could induce them to believe that they would call for such extraordinary powers without the sincerest conviction of their imperious necessity. He would refer to every measure which they had taken, to prove that they had in no instance been forward to avail themselves of opportunities of getting such extraordinary powers entrusted into their hands. In every case of the renewal or re-enactment of bills which went to invest them with powers which for a time suspended the usual privileges of the constitution, they had proceeded on the ground of such imperious necessity. They had seen, on former occasions, that such measures had contributed in a material degree to the salvation of the empire, and they conceived themselves bound, under circumstances nearly similar, to resort to measures of similar precaution and similar vigour. As his Majesty's ministers had not been forward to call for powers which they were conscious that they exercised under a most perilous responsibility, so their use of it certainly evinced nothing of a wish to employ those powers for any other purpose than the preservation of the public tranquillity in Ireland. He was happy that he could state, without fear of contradiction, that no one instance had occurred in which the powers granted by these bills had been exercised with wantonness, indiscretion or cruelty. With respect to theMartial Law Bill, he had to state to their lordships, that the powers which it granted were resorted to only in one solitary instance. In every other case the ordinary common law tribunals of the country had been resorted to. The result of this was not unknown to their lordships, and it was not unfair, from this past experience, to infer, that the same individuals who had exercised their powers with such mode-242ration, would not be likely to abuse them in future. It was the unfortunate state of Ireland which compelled ministers to resort to measures, which every friend to the constitution would adopt only when he viewed them as essential to the preservation of the state from the greatest miseries which could afflict a kingdom. He referred their lordships to the conduct pursued by ministers on the appearance of a most diabolical conspiracy in this country. On that occasion, several individuals had been convicted, on the clearest evidence, of a most atrocious conspiracy to compass the death of the sovereign, and had suffered the sentence of the law. What, he desired their lordships to recollect, had been the conduct of ministers? Satisfied with having brought atrocious criminals to condign punishment, they had resorted to no extraordinary measures. They had not come to. parliament and called on them to suspend any of the ordinary privileges of the constitution; they had appealed only to the common law courts of the country, and the cause of loyalty had been signally supported, while treason had suffered the punishment which it in every case merited. TheHabeas Corpus Actcontinued in full force. The idea of introducing martial law was not thought of, even for a moment. The reason of this their lordships must clearly comprehend. It was the result of a conviction on the part of ministers, that the loyalty of the great mass of the population was sound to the core. They found that a few frantic individuals had meditated a most desperate attempt on the life of our beloved sovereign; but they knew that the people at large were attached to their king, and devoted to the constitution of their country. They punished criminals, but they did not invade the privileges or suspend, even for a moment, the liberties of a people who had given so many instances of their unalterable loyalty. Very different, however, their lordships would agree with him, was the situation of Ireland. He needed not to expatiate on the circumstances of that country in the year 1798. At that period their lordships were aware that a rebellion, the most extensive, the most desperate, and the most malignant which it was ever the fate of a government to combat, had broke forth with the greatest possible fury. It was not necessary for him to recall to the recollection of their lordships, that the object of that rebellion was nothing short of the dissolution of British connexion, nothing less than the establishment of an independent government by means of the assistance of France. Fortunately, the valour of his Majesty's forces, aided by the co-ope-243ration of the loyal part of the population, had succeeded in putting down this rebellion, and in restoring tranquillity, at least tranquillity so far as the efforts of general rebellion were concerned. It was not, however, in the nature of things, that all the agitation, animosity, or revenge, which the atrocities of the rebellion had created, should at once subside. It was natural to expect, though rebellion was put down in the field, the spirit of its adherents was not broken. They dared no longer contend with the regular forces arrayed in the field; but they might be supposed to follow their former views in secret, and, unobserved, to prepare the means of new-insurrections and new crimes. This was the conclusion which a general knowledge of human nature justified, and, certainly, events had fully demonstrated its truth. From the time of the rebellion in 1798, there had been various evidences of a spirit of disaffection. Without, however, enlarging on these, he should at present content himself with alluding to the transaction of the 23d of July. With the events of that day their lordships were sufficiently acquainted. The evidence on the trials of the wretched individuals who suffered (or their guilt, clearly explained the object and views of those engaged in the conspiracy. He would not now take up the time of their lordships, in any attempt to point out the extent or the force of this attempt at rebellion. One tiling, however, was undoubted, and he begged leave to call it particularly to the attention of their lordships, and that was the circumstance of the abortive attempt of the 23d of July, having in view the same object, directed to the same end, of destroying the connexion betwixt this country and Ireland, by the assistance of the foreign and common enemy of both countries. Under these circumstances, he begged leave to appeal to the candour and fair judgment of their lordships, whether the notoriety of these events did not furnish a fair parliamentary ground of necessity for the renewal of the bills. A good deal might be urged a? to the severity of the measure of establishing martial law. He would never pretend that this was not to be regarded as a measure of an extraordinary nature, and only to be justified on grounds of an extraordinary emergency. Their lordships would recollect that his Majesty, by the exercise of his prerogative, had the power of proclaiming martial law, when it appeared to him to be called for by the circumstances under which any part of the244empire might be placed. It was not, however, unknown, that when martial law was proclaimed in this way, all the ordinary forms of law were, for the time being, suspended. In fact, the common law was in the interval considered to be extinct. When circumstances required such an exercise of the prerogative, it was obvious that every member of the community must be subjected to material inconvenience. The object of the present bills was to operate as measures of precaution. They were designed to repress the views of the disaffected, without interfering with the course of civil and criminal proceedings in the ordinary courts. He viewed theMartial Law Billnot as a measure of severity, but of extensive clemency to the loyal part of the community of Ireland. In the course of the rebellion of 1798, the excesses committed on both sides were the subject of much animadversion. The rebels were accused of giving vent to their fury, by acts of barbarous cruelty. On the other hand, many individuals attached to the government, and active in their exertions to put down the rebellion, were charged with the commission of many acts of savage retaliation. Believing, as he firmly did, that there was a great deal of exaggeration respecting the conduct of both parties on the occasion to which he had referred, he could not but allow, that, to a certain degree, they were founded in truth. It was impossible, in the nature of things, that, excesses could be altogether avoided. He was convinced, that the enactment of theMartial Law Billwas the measure which, more than any other, put an end to those excesses. It was clear to every one who reflected for a moment on the subject, that when individuals had the redress of their own injuries, real or supposed, put into their own hands, they were too seldom guided by moderation. The more unworthy passions of our nature too frequently gained the ascendency; and resentment, not satisfied with the punishment of a particular injury, proceeded the length of savage and deliberate revenge. The enactment of martial law put an end to this system. Government were then armed with powers sufficient for the suppression of rebellion. The loyal part of the community felt a confidence of receiving adequate protection. Their individual passions no longer descended lower than the performance of their public duty, and those scenes which, at the origin of the insurrection, disgraced and afflicted humanity, were no longer repeated. This was245a view of the subject which he considered to be of the highest importance, and he earnestly intreated their lordships to weigh well the inference which it warranted. In this consideration of the question, every argument drawn from the severity of the measure was materially diminished in its application; particularly when it was recollected that, hitherto, it had never been resorted to, with the exception of one case, in he had already, occasion to mention in the beginning of his speech. But, perhaps, it might be argued, that the circumstance of the powers granted by the bill not having been used, was (he best proof of its not being necessary. He must be permitted to protest against any such inference, which did not at all appear to him to be conclusive. It was not by any means unfair to conclude, that the very existence of the powers granted by the bill, was the reason for their never being actually exerted. This was no uncommon circumstance in the history of human affairs. Precaution frequently prevented evils of the greatest magnitude. The apprehension of certain punishment, paralysed the efforts, and blasted the hopes of the most desperate offenders. He had, he trusted, shewn their lordships, that the measures which he proposed were not urged on light or frivolous grounds. He had began by saying, that lie at all times should feel reluctance in proposing measures of severity, or measures which, even for the shortest time, put any part of his Majesty's subjects out of the enjoyment of the ordinary privileges of the constitution. The principle of our constitution, and the principle of which we were proud, was, that the people should enjoy as great a portion of practical liberty as they could enjoy, or, perhaps, he might add, as great a portion of liberty as ever was enjoyed by any civilized community since the beginning of time. It was not to be forgotten, however, that while it was the excellence of our constitution to grant to the people the greatest portion of practical liberty, it was cue of its wisest provisions, that extraordinary powers should be vested in the executive government, on the appearance of circumstances of extraordinary emergency. The object of this wise provision was, to enable the executive government to take proper measures of precaution for the safety of the state when threatened with formidable dangers, and at the same time, as far as possible, suffer the ordinary tribunals of law, to go on with their ordinary functions. Such a power as this, which he246had now stated grew out of the constitution, and was essential to its perfect application. It was an arrangement for affording to the well-affected part of the empire, the enjoyment of their usual privileges, and, at the same time, arming government with such power as would enable them to put down rebellion, whether openly arrayed in the field, or secretly meditating the means of renewed insurrection. It was to the government, a measure of strength; to the well affected, a measure of confidence and protection; to rebels, a measure of punishment and terror. In whatever light he regarded it as applicable to the present situation of Ireland, it appeared to him the wisest measure of precautionary power, that, under existing circumstances, could be adopted. Nothing but a conviction of its absolute necessity, could have induced his Majesty's ministers to urge its adoption. They had hitherto shewn no disposition to innovate on the privileges of the constitution, and, therefore, in proposing measures at this moment, which every friend to the constitution could propose only from a persuasion of their necessity, they were entitled to full credit for the sincerity of their motives. The noble lord, after a few more observations to the same effect, sat down by moving, first, that the bill for the continuance of theIrish Habeas Corpus Suspension Billbe read a second time.&#x2014;The question being put from the chair,", "author_id": "/people/mr-robert-jenkinson", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},

Lord Hutchinson, stating his opinion, that they would overwhelm a French army, if directed to a vigorous and prompt attack, similar to that which the suddenly raised levies of the his made upon the first detachment of the French troops: this noble lord said, that if invaded, the contest with the invader must be short, and he would slake his life upon the sue of such an assault; the observation of Ford Moira to the Scotch volunteers, was well known. Indeed, the opinions of these two celebrated generals, were those of all experienced men in the country who had any opportunity of judging. The right hon. gent, stood alone; his sentiment was complete singular. He decided, however, from theory, for had he seen the 28.000 men who assembled in Hyde Park, he must hove changed his opinion. But at that time he was seeking the distinction of a command in a volunteer corps in Norfolk&#x2014;a distinction he argued against this evening as to mischievous. But as to democracy, he could net help saying, that this Was the queerest part of the right hon. gentleman's charge upon the volunteers, for he appealed to the House whether there was one other man in the country, except himself, who would accuse the right hon. gent, or ministers, of being likely to favour democracy. What, he would ask, would the right hon. gent, propose to do with the volunteers? Would he have them quit being volunteers in order to make peasantry pf them? and how would he provide a force for the defence of the country? But really the right hon. gent., who was himself an officer in a volunteer corps, and aspiring to the rank of colonel, could not be serious in the objections he made to the volunteer institution. If he was, instead of applying to him the quotation \"His own example strengthened all his laws;\" It should be \"His own example weakened all his laws.&#x2014;\"But no doubt, as a military man, he would soon have to change his position,\" which he had contrived to do as a politician. \"However,\" observed the hon. member, \"let the right hon. gent change as he may, I shall con-298tinue to esteem the volunteers, among whom I should be happy to enrol myself; and, as 'the right hon. gent, under the gallery (Mr. Pitt) has so well trained a corps under his command, I would be glad to enter into his service.

At the first glance it would appear, that the services of the volunteers were to be acquired incalculably cheaper than those of any other description of the national force.

The active vigilance of the Irish government, had ascertained that there was a deficiency in the crop of potatoes, in three out of the four provinces of Ireland, and therefore, it became die wisdom of his excellency to provide for the supply of this deficiency, by prohibiting the use of oats in distillation. This be had done by a proclamation, issued in October, in which he had exceeded the powers which the law allowed him; and the object of the bill he should move for, was to indemnity him for having done so. He trusted, the house would consider the conduct of the Irish government, on this occasion, rather as deserving approbation than censure, for the laudable attention it had manifested in providing for the support of the people. He trusted the house would not object to the measure, and he proposed, it the house should accede to his motion, to introduce into die bill a clause to enable the lord lieutenant, or other chief governor of Ireland, to prohibit, for a certain lime, by proclamation, the distillation of spirits from oats. He was aware of the effect such a measure might have on the landed interest, and the revenue, but he trusted there would be no difficulty or objection to trusting such a discretionary power to the lord lieutenant, who would have every inducement to forbear from the exercise of it.

{"date": ["1803", "dec", "13"], "content": "said, he had already expressed his surprise at this Bill having been read a second time, without notice, the day after it came up to that House. He thought, that on the whole, it was best at the present moment to continue the Bank Restriction; but this was not a step to be taken with indifference, or to be forwarded as a ma Her of course through its various stages; it was, on the contrary, a great evil; necessary, perhaps, in such a crisis as the present, but well worthy of the most serious attention of Parliament. It had been first proposed as a measure merely temporary, to meet a momentary but very alarming danger; as such it had, he thought, been highly beneficial. But it had been attended with the mischief inseparable from all measures of the same description. The fundamental principle of all governments on this subject ought to be, that credit and circulation, if undisturbed by legislative interference, will invariably find their own level. Whenever any temporary purpose (as must sometimes happen) induces a departure from this principle, the misfortune is, that the first deviation too commonly leads to the necessity of a second, and so necessarily, until it becomes almost impossible to tread back the same steps, or to revert to the only wise system of policy on the subject. So it happened in this case. The measure adopted in the first instance to meet a momentary purpose had afterwards been prolonged (perhaps unavoidably) till the conclusion of that war; and even now, though he lamented the effects of that prolongation, he hardly ventured to decide that the opinion of Parliament had in that instance been wrong. Next came the peace, so very like war, that its authors themselves had been afraid to depart from the war system; nor had he himself then opposed its renewal, convinced as he was, that the pretended state of peace was a real state of war in every thing, except in the power of providing for self-defence, and for the protection of our own interest. To venture such a step in the present moment, at least with-305out much preparation, would doubtless be difficult and hazardous. Bat he was not equally convinced, that it was wise to declare beforehand that the restriction should continue during the whole of this war, entertaining, as he confessed he did, some doubt whether it ought to have been continued to the end of the last war, and still, more, whether it should be prolonged at the peace. He was afraid that there was now growing up in this country a most mistaken apathy on the subject. Many persons believed that the continuance or the restriction had hitherto produced no inconvenience, and that there was therefore no danger in prolonging it almost indefinitely. Both parts of this opinion were, he thought, extremely erroneous. Much evil, he was persuaded, had already been produced by the measure, however necessary at the time of its adoption; and every day's continuance augmented, in a rapid proportion, both the extent of the evil and the difficulty of its removal.&#x2014;That, during the continuance of this measure, our paper circulation, both Bank and private paper, had infinitely increased, no man was ignorant of. He was afraid it might be shewn, that this was a necessary consequence of the measure it-self. The power of converting paper into cash at the will of the holder, was the only sale limitation that ever could exist upon the issue of paper, and, if left to its free operation, it was a limitation that might safely be relied on. All other limitations were arbitrary, depending on the uncertain speculations of individuals upon points which no speculations ever can decide with accuracy. It was said that, if the Bank had not increased its circulating paper since the restriction, no mischief can have arisen from it. No position can be more fallacious. In the first place, the Bank paper has in fact increased; but, even if this had not happened, the argument would still be of no weight. If private paper has during that period been greatly augmented, it is plain that the whole proportion of paper to cash in circulation has been changed, and that this change has equally taken place, whether the increase has arisen in Bank paper or in private paper. The restraint upon the Bank must necessarily give some increased encouragement to the issue of private paper, because, for private paper, cash may legally be demanded, for Bank paper it cannot; and if, by these or any other means, the proportion of private paper be much increased, there must obviously be less room for the circulation even for the same quantity as before of Bank paper; and306there is therefore much more reason to apprehend that the issue is too large, when it appears that instead of remaining at the same amount, the quantity of Bank paper has also been very much increased. The actual increase of private paper, a fact which no one could dispute, was the particular circumstance to which Lord G. said, he principally wished to call the attention of the House.&#x2014;\"Paper (he said) now forms in this country the principal medium of circulation between man and man, not as formerly in commercial transactions only, but now in all the ordinary dealings of life. In times of perfect security and public confidence, even this might happen to a considerable extent without much inconvenience; and so long as the natural operations of demand and supply were allowed to control it, though some excess might occasionally take place, yet experience shewed, that any such evil would speedily correct itself. The tide might ebb and flow, but no permanent interruption would arise from it to the stream of national prosperity. The case is widely different now. We are called upon to provide against the danger of a sudden alarm, such as must arise it a country so long unused to the tread of a hostile foot should even fur the shortest interval become the theatre of war. But we are discharging this duty in a most inadequate and insufficient manner. We an? providing for the smaller evil, but seem wholly indifferent to the greater. We are guarding against the consequences of any sudden run upon the Bank in a moment of alarm; but we take no consideration of the effect of a similar alarm on that mass of private paper, which constitutes so much larger a proportion of the circulating medium of the country. The stability of the Bank has been guaranteed to its creditors by repeated parliamentary examinations; and when we restrain it by law from fulfilling its engagements with them, we have given a fresh pledge of public faith that they shall suffer no loss by that provision. But what will be the case of private paper? Let the House represent to itself the situation of a Bank, established perhaps in the very town to be first attacked, and the state of the surrounding district, whose circulation consists perhaps almost exclusively of that paper. What means will such a Bank possess to satisfy even the ordinary demands upon it? How much would those demands in such a case be increased? And what would be the state of such a district, if to all the other evils of war were added the sudden annihilation of its whole circulating307medium? Already are we told from authority, that there appears in the country an eagerness to collect, or, as it is insidiously called, to hoard cash. In times of scarcity the ignorant are taught to clamour against the farmer and the cornfactor, who, by collecting and preserving grain, afford to a country its only security against famine. By the salutary provision of nature, the measures which individuals take in such cases for their own security and benefit, constitute in their aggregate the security and advantage of the community itself. In the same manner (it might appear paradoxical, but if a paradox, it was one which he held in common with ail enlightened writers on this subject) the best security against a total want of circulating medium in the time of our utmost need, would be found in the necessity, which persons in the middling classes of life already feel, of providing beforehand for such an occasion. How, indeed, could it be expected, that when a man of that description joins the volunteer ranks, and serves his country in the field, he should leave his family to rely entirely, and for their daily bread, on the paper of a private banker, whose counting-house may be at that very moment occupied by the enemy.&#x2014;The steps taken by such individuals to make provision for this case, must then of necessity produce at this time an increased demand for specie; that demand will in this, as in every other article, produce an increased value; and, unless the nature of things be inverted, tire increased value must, in its turn, produce air increased supply. He was therefore beyond measure astonished to hear that, in some other place, this conduct in persons of such a description had been spoken of as a fit subject of reproach and censure; and that this opinion had proceeded from a quarter which ought to be of the highest authority in matters of this nature. Such language could have no other tendency in this case (as in that to which lie had already likened it) than to raise popular odium, and to excite popular tumult, against men who used their own discretion in disposing of their own property. If it were lit to censure such a disposition, it must be essential to endeavour to prevent it. There were two precedents in history which might be resorted to for this purpose: two cases where, in support of an excessive issue of paper, government had regulated by law the quantity of specie which each individual should be suffered to retain. Those were the Mississippi scheme, and the scheme of the assignats. In both308instances the measure had immediately annihilated the paper it was intended to support. He had no fear that the same principle, by whatever authority it had been countenanced, would be acted upon to the same extent in this country but he must take the liberty to say, that, in so far as it was followed up, either in speech or action, exactly in that proportion the public credit was affected and injured by it. The danger of such a shock to private paper, as he had stated, in the case of invasion, was not to be guarded against by such language, which had no other tendency than to increase that danger. Neither was it one which, on the other hand, it was prudent or safe for us to overlook. The wretched policy of neglecting necessary precautions for fear of creating just alarm began now to be sufficiently understood. In every instance in which it was resorted to, it always would produce the same effects as had already been so fatally experienced from it. Yet, by the present bill, while we confess the nature of the danger, the slightest glance at the proportion which private paper bears to that of the Bank will shew how far we are from providing for its extent. Those who at all understand the subject, know that the Bank paper possesses a stability not to be shaken but by such a total subversion of the country as no Englishman wishes to survive. Yet we think ourselves obliged to protect even this corporation, resting on such immutable pillars of security, against the danger of sudden pressure from temporary alarm. Shall we then wholly overlook the private paper, so much greater in extent, and so much less secure in its stability? The ultimate security of the paper issued by the country banks now established in every corner of this island might be as perfect as that of the Bank itself The facility which they give in ordinary times to the commercial transactions of the country is unquestionable. But no man can look without the most serious apprehension at, the temporary effect which the first moment of actual invasion might produce on those, local establishments; at the extent to which such an evil might spread; or at the consequences which it might produce, in a country whose circulation is almost entirely composed of paper. To represent this danger to Parliament, even if no remedy for it occurred to the person stating it, would not only be a blameless, but a laudable and proper discharge of public duty. When the subject was brought under the consideration of Parliament and the public, if309its importance engaged their attention, the wisdom and experience of men much more conversant than he pretended to be, would doubtless suggest every remedy or precaution which the nature of the case admitted; suggestions which might well escape the researches of individuals far superior to him in knowledge or ability. But if the subject should continue to be wholly disregarded, overlooked by negligence, or put out or sight by hopeless despondency, the evil would corns upon us at the last; it would overtake us in the midst of difficulty and distress, when precaution would be too late, and remedy impossible he therefore earnestly recommended, after the recess, if it could not be done before, that Committees might be named by Parliament, to take this subject into the most serious and attentive consideration. To such Committees it would naturally belong to suggest those remedies, which, on full discussion and consultation with men experienced in such matters, might appear most practicable and useful. Any suggestions of his would in the present moment be premature, and certainly must be in a great measure crude and undigested. Bat ho by no means despaired of seeing the most beneficial consequences result from such an investigation. Two objects it would naturally have in view. The first to reintroduce into the circulation of the country such a quantity of coin as might at least suffice for the ordinary dealings of life; that coin which was now vanished by the excessive issues of paper of all descriptions, no longer checked by the natural limitation, that of being immediately convertible into cash. The next object naturally would be, to provide, as far as possible, for the stability and credit,even during the existence of actual invasion,of such paper as would still continue to circulate. These objects would both of them, as he apprehended, best be obtained, by recurring, not suddenly nor abruptly, but by well considered gradations, and with every possible attendant precaution that the wisdom of man could devise, to that first principle by which alone paper issues can be limited, and on which it alone can securely rest, namely, the power of their immediate conversion into cash. He spoke on this subject with all the distrust of his own opinion, which lie ought to feel; but at least he spoke not without much consideration of the question; and the conviction of his own mind was, that this was the end to be kept invariably in view, to be accelerated as could be found consistent with prudence and due regard to public safety, and to be considered as the only fundamental cause of310the evils now felt or apprehended. With respect to the paper, if resting on a solid foundation of ultimate solvency, it might be provided for by some mutual guarantee, so far removed from the scene of immediate alarm, as to place the security of the holder far beyond the reach of any danger merely local. He remembered to have heard it said many years ago by Mr. Burke, a man whose words and thoughts were well calculated to leave a lasting impression on their hearers, \"That the effect of the system of credit in this country was such as to make the whole commercial and monied interest of Great Britain joint proprietors and co-partners in the whole mass of capital existing in the country.\" In some sense this was undoubtedly loose; and as these extensive interests had the benefit of such a partnership, so it must be added that they were not wholly-exempt from its risks. They had all an immediate interest in upholding the credit ofall;and he did not despair, that, by examination and discussion, a system might be framed, in which the paper of individuals or private houses might, if resting on a sure and due foundation, be supported toga limited extent, by some extensive and reciprocal guarantee against the effects of sudden alarm; and to such a voluntary association, formed under the direction of Parliament, and countenanced by its authority, there might or might not be added, as should on the whole be judged expedient, some additional security from the intervention of the public. In his own mind, he had followed these ideas further, and pursued them into some detail; but he wished not to trouble the House at this time with any discussion of them. No man felt more strongly the difficulty and delicacy of the whole subject. No man more sincerely distrusted his own judgment upon it: but, impressed as he was with its importance, satisfied that if we were unprepared in this respect, ail naval and ail military preparation, however extensive, would be inadequate to the safety of the country; he had done his duty in calling the attention of Parliament to the question. He had no doubt that the danger of leaving it unexamined was infinitely greater than any danger that could, by any possibility, arise from the examination of it; and it would therefore be offering an insult to the understandings of the House, if he delayed them by any farther explanation of the motives with which he brought it forward. He could have no interest in increasing the public danger. If this evil could not be avoided, we must prepare ourselves to meet it with resolution. But such a shock as the311sudden depreciation of the whole circulatory medium of a country, and this too in a moment of invasion, must, in its consequences, overwhelm all men, of whatever descriptions or situations in the country. He was confident that diligence, wisdom, and firmness, would avert this, and every other danger of the country: but this could only be done by ascertaining the nature and extent of the evils with which we were menaced. This bill was itself a proof that the subject of public credit was not thought unfit for public discussion, or incapable of parliamentary provision; and the matters he had now brought before the House were nothing else than different branches of the same extensive subject.", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-grenville", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},
{"date": ["1803", "dec", "13"], "content": "then rose, and spoke nearly as follows:&#x2014;I rise, my lords, to offer some remarks in reply to what has fallen from the noble lord who has just sat down. In some of the general principles which he has stated, I most certainly cannot but agree with him, though I cannot concur in his application of them, in the present instance. And, indeed, in listening to some parts of his lordship's speech, it was difficult for me to recognize the words of one who had so great a shire in proposing this measure originally. That the proportion of paper in circulation to the amount of the specie ought to be left to find its own natural level, and that, except in some particular situations, it will, when left to itself, find its natural level, is a principal in political economy, that no one can be hardy enough in the present day to controvert. I agree, therefore, that legislative interference, or any sort of interference, ought, if possible, to be avoided; but at the same time circumstances may occur, and his lordship has admitted that this may be the case, when the good to be derived from such a measure far overbalances the evils that may be consequent upon it. When this bill was originally brought into Parliament, there were a few who were not at all convinced of the necessity of it; these, however, were but very few. Others were a ware of its magnitude and importance, yet still thought that, under the then circumstance, of menaced invasion, very like our present situation, a run upon the bank, in consequence of the alarm, might be attended with the most pernicious consequences, and therefore joined in giving their vote for the proposed restriction. I also had turned my attention to the subject, and I will fairly own that the difficulties with which it was surrounded pressed heavily on my mind, and one of the chief of these was, that a precedent might thus be established, which could in its consequences be attended with no be-312neficial effects, I, however, upon mature deliberation, was convinced that under all the circumstances of the case, the restriction was necessary. It was afterwards thought expedient to continue the operation of the act during the whole course of the last war. At the close of the war the Government of the country thought it necessary, upon several grounds, that the restriction should be continued for one year, subsequent to the conclusion of the treaty of peace. But although I so far agree with the noble lord in the general principle, that it is proper to avoid all interference in those things, which, by their own natural operations, will find their just level, I am by no means prepared to admit that these consequences have resulted from the restriction upon the bank, which he has ascribed to it, or that such consequences are to be dreaded. It will, perhaps, be in the recollection of all, that previous to the last war, and four years before the original passing of this bill, the quantity of paper had increased to an enormous degree. This naturally arose from the extensive speculation and commercial enterprize of the country. These, along with the improvement in agriculture, the spirit of adventure, the riches and growing population of the nation brought a quantity of paper into circulation above its just proportion to the amount of cash. The very means by which our power and wealth were improved, therefore gave rise to a sort of artificial capital, which was certainly an evil, but an evil that must of necessity be endured, as it arose from such a cause. These, it evidently appeared, were the courses of the great proportion of paper in circulation, and to these causes the evil, if it were an evil, for there are considerable deferences of opinion on that point, is to be traced rather than to the operation of the bill in question. His lordship has adverted to what was said in another place, (the House of Commons) with respect to laying up cash at this time, or, as it has been generally called, hoarding, by a certain hon. gent, high in administration (Mr. Addington). I sincerely agree with the noble lord, and it has been, as he has stated it, the opinion of the most eminent and luminous writers on political economy, that laying up any commodity in times of a scarcity of that commodity, is a corrective of the scarcity. No one now that pretends to be at all conversant with the subject, but knows the ignorance of those popular clamours which in times of general scarcity are raised against the cornfactor and the farmer, who are, in fact, the only instruments by which countries visited with scarcity are preserved from absolute famine. But the noble lord has certainly mistaken the313sense in which the words to which he alluded were applied. In another place, a censure, and a just censure, was meant to be cast upon those individuals, who were so defective in their patriotism as in the present moment to hoard up their money and keep it out of general circulation, from a want of confidence in the security of their country; and in this sense the words were certainly used. Though communities, such as the bank, upon which the credit of the country depended, ought certainly to keep as much cash as is adequate to the demands of the nation, and hoarding therefore is proper in them, the ca-e I apprehend is very different, as far as it respects individuals.&#x2014;Now with respect to the proposals of the noble lord as to the appointment of a committee; the noble lord has not brought forward these in form, nor as objections to the present passing of the bill. I desire therefore to be understood, as not either according to, or absolutely denying the plan to which he has adverted I agree with him, that some particularly important evils may, even in times of danger and alarm, be brought forward under peculiar circumstances, and proposed to the consideration of Parliament though the person who does thus bring them forward, cannot, at the time, suggest to his own satisfaction any full and adequate remedy. The first remedy which he suggests to the evil which he thinks to arise from the Bank's restriction, is, that the Bank should gradually, and with much prndent forethought be made to resume its payments in specie. If, however, the evil does not arise from this cause, but from the other causes which I have already mentioned, viz. the increasing commerce and agriculture of the country, it follows that this remedy will not avail for correcting that evil. But the noble lord will also recollect, that though under all circumstances his Majesty's government had thought it advisable to propose the passing of this act during the whole course of the present war, the act may still be repealed by Parliament, if previous to that time, the necessity that at present exists should by any means be done away. I can assure the noble lord, that this subject has not been left unnoticed by his Majesty's government.&#x2014;Now, to examine the other remedy, which he suggests for giving greater security to public credit. I suppose his lordship means that something of the same nature should be resorted to as that sort of plan which was adopted in 1973, of giving government paper and security to such individuals as could prove to the satisfaction of a Committee that they had real and solid property to the amount. I was not at die time314perfectly satisfied with this scheme; and from what has since fallen under my own observation, nothing short of a very strong necessity indeed could oblige me to give my assent to such a measure. I do not therefore say, that no circumstances could exist in which I should think the plan advisable to be adopted. But I know that a great many inconveniences, if not serious evils, arise from it. One of these was, that where great commercial bodies, or great manufactories were established, 2nd any embarrassment occurred among them, the proprietors immediately applied to Parliament for relief. The great inconvenience and mischief of this plan, therefore, was, that it gave a sort of security to people, which made them not trust to themselves, and encouraged them to rely upon the public security in the worst that could happen. I shall do, the persons who were then, and those who are now engaged in the places that rendered it their immediate concern to attend to these things, the justice to say, that they gave every discouragement consistent with prudence and propriety to applications of this sort. But it is a fact, that much mischief would result from a scheme of this nature, in teaching people to rely upon public security instead of their own exertions. Bankruptcies might thus, in some instances, be prevented; but, in the natural course of things, great, extensive, and ill founded speculation would bring on bankruptcies, which, in fact, are the natural correctives that apply to such evils. In such cases, therefore, the public ought not to interfere. Upon the whole, without giving any decided opinion as to his lordship's remedies, I may say that, at present, I do not perceive that they apply to the evils proposed to be remedied, and that it appears to me, in fact, that the evil itself, if it be an evil, does not arise from the cause to which his lordship a-scribes it.", "author_id": "/people/mr-robert-jenkinson", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},

The danger was, that many of them as soon as the present ballot was over, would attend no longer, and thus being lost to the militia and the army of reserve, would be lost also to the volunteer corps. He wished therefore, that the present measure were coupled with some general regulations for the corps. He thought it wise in ministers to be as saving of the public money as was consistent with the public interests, and the public safety, but at the same time he thought it would be wise to enter on some general plan for the improvement of the volunteer corps. He did not think that the plan proposed last night (by Mr. Pitt) would go down. The volunteer officers were pledged to their corps to accompany them where ever they should be ordered, and of course they would not tike that a field officer should be put over their heads, neither would the appointment of such an officer be agreeable to the volunteers who composed the corps. He thought it would be much better to give serjeant-majors and adjutants in greater numbers, to give a second serjeant, and a corporal, with permanent pay. It was well known that the discipline of the men depended on their haying good non-commissioned officers. He was sure too much could not he said of the honourable principles and feelings of the volunteers in general. But though an ignominious discharge from the ranks would have the fullest effect in many instances, it would not in all. He thought it better that intoxication, disorderly and unsolder-like conduct should be punished by a small fine, peremptorily and immediately enforced. He was-sure that the effect of this, and some similar regulations, would produce a degree of good conduct and emulation, which would237extend with the most beneficial effect to the army and militia, as well as volunteers Looking to the military face which the country wore at present, every thing should be done to realize the appearance, and if ministers deferred for a time bringing forward such regulations is as were necessary to this effect, he hoped it was only to bring them forward in a more systematic and digested form, at no distant period. He wished ho House also to bear in mind, that in the country, where several corps were called together from their home and from their daily labour, by which most of them subsisted, obliged to give up their usual emoluments and to live at public houses at an unusual expense, it would be impossible to find men. and unreasonable to expect there without allowing them pay.

He considered, that with some advantages of this kind the volunteers would soon be as good a force as any we possessed for defence; that we trust to them wit security, and spare our regular forces for foreign expeditions.

{"date": ["1803", "dec", "05"], "content": "rose, and spoke as follows:&#x2014;Sir; the observations, which I am about to offer, will be comprised within a very narrow compass. Indeed, I should not have intruded myself at all upon the patience of the house, if I could, compatibly with the view I entertain of my duty towards the country, to which this bill immediately relates, have permitted a measure of such moment to pass in a silence, that might have the appearance of a listless indifference. The affairs of Ireland must be universally admitted to merit the serious attention and earnest solicitude of every member of Parliament; but there are several among us, who are under more peculiar and indispensable obligations to watch over its concerns. I mean, Sir, those who gave their voles for the legislative union of the two countries. It does especially be hove such of us as were instrumental in the extinction of the local parliament of Ireland, to shew to die people of that country, so far at least as may depend I upon our individual exertions, that we have substituted in its place a legislature adequate, not only in means, but in zeal, diligence, and constancy, for the discharge of the trust confided to it. The local Parliament, Sir, had indisputably one eminent advantage. Being. from the very circumstance of its locality, more intimately mixed with the transactions of the country, it had a shorter and more easy access to information in respect to I its internal state than a more remote legislature can possess, This inconvenience attached to the united Parliament, the friends of the union believed, would be far over-balanced by the numerous and solid benefits likely to accrue from that measure; but no one can contend, that it is not an additional call on this Parliament, for its most active vigilance and assiduous application with regard to the interests of Ireland. The inquisitorial power of Parliament, Sir, is the very vital principle of ail its privileges and functions, and I trust this authority will ever be exercised fairly, faithfully, and impartially, throughout every part of the united kingdom. Before, we frame laws for Ireland, it is incumbent on us to have before us, an accurate state of the country for which we are about to legislate. Under these impressions, Sir, I come to the matter before us, which every one must feel to be of the most grave and critical importance. It is a demand upon us, for continuing to the executive government of Ireland, the power of depriving, at its discretion, a very large de-91scription of our fellow subjects of those rights of liberties, to which, by the ordinary principles of the constitution, they are entitled. The measure, Sir, has certainly been often adopted. That it has been too frequently necessary, and that in many instances even the preservation of the country has been attributable to it, is a position I shall be the last man in this house to deny, and should be at variance with all my past conduct, if I were disposed to dispute it. But I should feel myself acting in direct contradiction to the motives, which have on former occasions impelled me to vote for the measure, if I were not to expect such parliamentary information as might enable every gentleman to form a clear and satisfactory judgment in respect to its present necessity. I was a member, Sir, in the Irish parliament, at the period in which the first martial law bill was introduced, and if I am inaccurate in my recollection of the grounds upon which it was originally founded, I am in the presence of several gentlemen, who are well able to correct me. On the commencement of the rebellion in the year l798, the lord lieutenant, with the advice of the privy council, issued orders (notified by proclamation) to the officers commanding his Majesty's forces to employ the troops under their command with the utmost vigour and decision for the suppression of the rebellion; the rebellion, however, extending itself insomuch that several very daring attacks and outrages were committed both on the troops and on the persons and properties of many loyal persons, the lord lieutenant, by the advice of the privy council, directed all the general officers commanding his Majesty's fortes, to punish all rebellious offenders according to martial Jaw. This order was likewise notified by a proclamation, which, together with the former order and proclamation, was communicated to parliament; and the houses of lords and commons by their addresses, expressed their entire approbation of those measures, with assurances to his excellency of their cordial support. Nevertheless the rebellion continued so late as the year 1799 in several parts of the country, and the ordinary course of justice and of the common law was in many places interrupted, in consequence of which the martial law bill was enacted. All these particulars, Sir, are set forth in the preamble to that act, which will be found among the Irish statutes now before you; and I cannot omit to remark that, when the bill was introduced, there were on the92table of the Irish house of commons two reports of two secret committees, which contained a very minute and detailed history both of the system and extent of the treason connected with the rebellion, and the last of the reports had been presented so late as the end of the preceding session. In the year 1800 the law was revived, but in fact it was to be considered as a continuance of the former act passed upon the grounds I have stated; and it is to be observed too, that at the opening of the session the lord lieutenant had stated in his speech from the throne, that, though public tranquillity had been in a great measure restored, there still continued in several districts a disposition to outrage and conspiracy. In the year 1801 the act of the former year was, about the period of the King's recovery, continued for a very short time, by the united parliament, without an enquiry and it was in the course of the same session renewed a second time; but upon what pr needing did the house then adopt the measure? On a report from a secret committee actually recommending it.&#x2014;And you, Sir, then chief secretary to the lord lieutenant of Ireland, brought in the bill upon that specific ground. Now, Sir, let me ask, whether the house possesses such information in the present instance, as that to which both the Irish and the united parliament were thought entitled, when on former occasions they have passed this measure? From the introduction of the law, which this bill is intended to continue, to this moment we only know that there was a rebellious insurrection in Dublin, on the 23d of July last, in which Lord Kilwarden and his nephew were murdered. The extent of the conspiracy, whether there were any correspondent movements in the North or South of Ireland, whether any papers were found developping the object of the treason, are points of which parliament has been kept in a state of the most profound and humiliating ignorance. When the message communicating the insurrection was delivered I was absent from town, but I have on a former occasion declared, that, if I had been in the house, I should have given my vole for the existing law, partly on a temporary and coerced confidence in the assertions of his Majesty's ministers, that prompt and vigorous measures were absolutely necessary, and partly on the intelligence contained in private letters, which several of my acquaintance in London had received. But, Sir, I protest I93should have voted for it under a clear conviction that his Majesty's ministers would, so soon as they could have arranged and digested it, laid before Parliament a farther detailed communication not only in respect to the conspiracy but to the general stale of the country, and on this ground gave my most cordial and zealous support to a motion, which was made at the close of this last session for procuring such information. The Parliament however was prorogued without one ray of light on the situation of Ireland, and in this slate of darkness we are now called upon to continue these extraordinary powers to the Irish government. Sir, I do for one declare with the most genuine sincerity, that in the present dearth of our information, I do not feel able to form a decisive judgment upon this question, for it is impossible even to estimate the real magnitude of the late conspiracy, which seems always to expand or contract in conformity to the views of those who describe it. I am therefore not prepared to negative the bill, but I must express my hope that the progress of it will be suspended until some parliamentary ground is laid for its necessity. Ireland may be in such a state as to render the measure absolutely requisite, but surely, Sir, it is not too much to ask for some document, some evidence, some information on the subject. It may be said that this bill is only the continuance of an existing law, and that in one or two instances the martial law bill has been renewed without any previous specific communication from government; but, Sir, the present proposition is for the continuance of an act, which pissed, as it were, by acclamation, in the exigency of the moment, and which itself, as I contend, stands, in a constitutional view, upon a defective title. It will probably be alleged too that we ought to vote this measure upon confidence in his Majesty's ministers, who will be responsible for the execution of it. Now, Sir, I aver it is a case, in which there is no pretence for confidence. On a subject of such magnitude and importance I cannot consent to act on the principle of implicit faith in any government. Much information may clearly be given to us, which care be divulged without a possibility of detriment to the state, and that class of intelligence, which may require more caution and reserve in the communication of it, may be afforded to us through the medium of a secret committee. No injury can result from the delay as the existing law will not expire for some weeks. But perhaps, his94Majesty's ministers may tell me that they cannot argue with me on the point of confidence, as I profess a general want of confidence in them; and concur with those who think them incompetent to the trust they have assumed. But such, Sir, is the whimsical dilemma in which ministers have placed themselves, that I defy any man, who gives implicit faith to the scanty information they have furnished to us, to vote for this measure. I relied upon the little intelligence they have afforded us, I must, on the plain principles of common sense and justice, meet this bill with my unqualified negative. The onlyparliamentaryinformation before the house in respect to the state of Ireland is contained in the King's speech, for the trials, to which we have been referred, do not come within the description of parliamentary documents. Now, Sir, in the King's speech the conspiracy is alluded to as a past event. We are told \"that the public tranquillity has experienced no further interruption, and that a hope is indulged, that such of his Majesty's deluded subjects as have swerved from their allegiance are now convinced of their error; and that having compared the advantages they derive from the protection of a free constitution, with the condition of those countries which are under the dominion of the French government, they will cordially and zealously concur in resisting any attempt that may be made against the security and independence of the united kingdom.\" We have generally, Sir, been accustomed to hear the advantages of the British constitution described as positive benefits, and I cannot help remarking, that this is the first instance within my recollection, in which they have been in astate paperexemplified by a mere comparison with the miseries of surrounding nations. Bat to proceed, Sir, the only other source of information is the report of the proceedings of the special commission in Dublin for the trial of the conspirators. This, however, I must again deny to be a parliamentary document; bat I have recourse to it, partly for want of other intelligence, and partly because I understand his Majesty's ministers have in a former discussion on this subject recommended us to resort to it. In making this reference, I naturally look to the opinion of the first law-officer of the crown, who must be supposed to have the best means of information, and I shall therefore take the liberty of reading to the house two or three passages from different parts of the speech95of the attorney general to the jury, on the first trial that took place under the special commission, from which gentlemen will be able to collect his sentiments, both with respect to the general state of the country, and to the magnitude of the late conspiracy.&#x2014;Speaking of the disastrous transactions of the 23d of July, he says: \"Certainly it is matter of some consolation toknow,that the conspiracy which broke out into open insurrection on the 23d of July last,was confined within much narrower limits than the promoters of it are willing to inculcate.Whether we consider thenumberswho have embarked in the enterprise,their wealth or their character, itwill appearcontemptible in the extreme.So far as it had for its odious object the subversion of the government and constitution of this country, it wasabsurd and romantick,it wasidle,andvisionary even in the opinion of many of those who embraced it.&#x2014;Again, notwithstanding the horrors of that night (23d July) which no man can regret more than I do, yet I think they furnish some ground for reflection, thatthe people, who had been worked into arms from one end of the country to the other in.1798,could not be roused beyond the assemblage of aDESPERATE MOB,as contemptible in number as it was atrocious in disposition.After avowing their object to be to overset the government of the country, and to break the connexion with England, they state that 19 counties will come forward with promptitude to effect it.But five weeks have since elapsed, and not one singlecounty has come forward at their call. THE CONSPIRACY SEEMS ALMOST ENDED WHERE IT BEGAN. And in another passage the learned gentleman observes, though from the abandoned profligacy of those who were employed in the execution of it (the conspiracy), we have to lament many private calamities and disgusting horrors; yet perhaps they should be considered as the visitations of Providence to confound the devices of our enemies,and to rouse the loyal energiesof the nation.\" This last remark, however, does not, I confess, appear to be quite consistent with the learned gentleman's general impression of the improved disposition of die country, for we cannot entertain a very favourable idea of the meliorated temper of a people, who require the massacre of a chief magistrate and the less of several lives, in order torouse their loyal energies.But, Sir, I believe I shall be allowed accurately to sum Up the information we have received, by stating the amount to be, that the late con-96spiracy was contemptible both in numbers and character, and seems almost to have ended where it began, that there has been no further interruption of the public tranquillity, and that the hope is indulged that the deluded are now convinced of their error, and that they will cordially and zealously concur in the defence of the kingdom against the common enemy. And what is the inference, which his Majesty's ministers require us to draw from this statement? The continuance of the martial law bill!! Now, Sir, I ask whether such a conclusion from such premises would be reconcilable to any principle of common reason and equity? I have not had an opportunity of looking into the preamble of this bill, but I should imagine that the drawing of it must have exposed the reasoning faculties of the crown lawyers (and no one can rate their talents higher than I do) to great embarrassment. It it folly describes the parliamentary ground of the measure it must, I apprehend, run thus. \"Whereas the late contemptible and insignificant conspiracy in the city of Dublin, was so speedily and effectually suppressed, that it seems almost to have ended where it began, and whereas the public tranquility has experienced no further interruption, and there is reason to indulge the hope, that the deluded are convinced of their error, and tint they will cordially and zealously concur in resisting any attempt that may he made against the security and independence of the united kingdom; be it enacted, that the lord-lieutenant of Ireland be invested with the power of declaring martial law, &c.; &c.;\" Now, Sir, this I apprehend, will not be thought sound logic, and yet such must be the language of this bill, if it is framed on the only information his Majesty's ministers have afforded to parliament, and thus, I trust I have proved myself justified in asserting, that those who reposed with implicit confidence On the representations of the king's servants, must, as it appears to me, on every principle of consistency and justice, give this measure their most decided opposition. But I, Sir, profess myself to have no such confidence. I have long since remarked with deep regret, that his Majesty's minieters are apt to lake very false and erroneous views of the situation of the affairs intrusted to their direction. We all remember the expectation, which they seemed to indulge themselves, and which they certainly permitted the public to indulge, until almost the very day, en which the chancellor of the exchequer annonced the menacing preparations of the enemy. But Ireland, Sir, itself furnishes a most illustrious instance of this sort97of self delusion on the part of his Majesty's ministers. The flattering descriptions of the State of that country, which were given 5at various timesbyseveral gentlemen, in the coarse of the last session, cannot have been forgot by any member of this house. The speech of the right hon. gent, opposite to me (the Chancellor of the Exchequer), on one of these occasions, in answer to ray right hon. friend near me (Mr. Windham), will not easily be effaced from my memory. He told us that there were in this war, none of the odious restrictions on the liberties of the people, which it had been necessary to impose in the last. No suspension of the habeas corpus act. No martial law bill. Loyalty, harmony, and zeal for the public service, prevailed universally throughout the united kingdom, and all these benefits he described as the result of the peace of Amiens; and yet within a week afterwards, I assert positively, within a week afterwards, the same hon. gent, came to this house, announcing an insurrection in Dublin, and bringing in his hand two bills, one for the suspension of the habeas corpus act, and the other for the declaration of martial law. And here, Sir, I trust, will terminate their vaunting encomiums on the peace of Amiens; for I protest, from past experience, I never hear such exalting and ostentatious statements from the treasury bench, without a sort of superstitious apprehension of some approaching calamity. But, Sir, I must maintain, that the mysterious circumstances of this very transaction of the 23d of July, which is the basis of the present measure, furnishes an additional reason why the house should not proceed without further information. It now appears, that, while his Majesty's ministers were accumulating eulogies on the treaty of Amiens, the rebels in Dublin were collecting military stores; and that a large magazine was actually formed, without, as I have good foundation for believing, even a suspicion of it on the part of the Irish government. The government of Ireland, however, was not without pretty urgent intimations of some treasonable confederacy. The explosion of a secret gunpowder-mill, the detection of the conveyance of prepared ammunition in the streets of Dublin, and the intelligence, given by several most respectable individuals, of sure indications of approaching commotion, were formidable warning nevertheless the government seems to have been surprised. But when this suggestion was made by my right hon. friend near me (Mr. Windham), his Ma-98jesty's ministers denied the imputation with indignation. \"Why,\" said my hon. friend, \"it was not unnatural for me to suppose it a surprise; because, a few days only have intervened, since you gave this house the most captivating description of the internal tranquillity and loyalty of Ireland.\" Still the answer from his Majesty's ministers was, \"that the government in Ireland had been prepared.\" \"What precaution did you take, except strengthening two or three guards in the vicinity of Dublin,\" asked my hon. friend? \"Did you make any previous communication to the privy council? No. To the lord mayor? No: the Mansion-house was robbed of a considerable quantity of arms. To the chief justice? No: he fell a victim to his ignorance of the information government possessed.\" Nevertheless his Majesty's ministers persevere in asserting, that proper provision was made against impending danger, and that the conduct of the Irish government was full of energy and alertness. The fact may have been so, Sir, but I honestly acknowledge I have my doubts of it; and f do in my conscience believe that a majority of this house, and of the public, doubt it. Sir, I criminate no man, for I know not, supposing there is ground for censure, to whom the blame a teaches. There is no one who entertains more personal respect and esteem for the individual at the head of the administration of Ireland than I do, and for several members of the different departments of that government I have the most cordial friendship: but the very interest that I take in their fame, increases my anxiety for an investigation of the mystery, in which this whole transaction is enveloped. Sir, I beseech gentlemen for a moment to mike this case their own: suppose, that while his Majesty's ministers were exhausting their eloquence in expatiating on the internal harmony and loyalty attributed to a peace which lasted but a twelvemonth, and in the course of which the enemy was detected in devices for sending military spies into the country, a traitorous plot should have suddenly burst on this metropolis, and that, in the exigency of the occasion, the parliament had vested in the crown, the same powers it his given to the lord lieutenant of Ireland: suppose it should have afterwards appeared, that, though a secret powder mill, and a quantity of prepared ammunition, had been previously detected, and the government warned of the danger, by several most respectable persons, yet that no communication should have been99made to the privy council, to any of the great officers of state, or to the Lord Mayor, and that the chief justice of the King's Bench should have been murdered, and the mansion house robbed of arms Imagine, too. that the session should have been permitted to close without any detailed informal ion to Parliament; that during the recess the attorney general should declare on the trials of the persons concerned in the treason, that the conspiracy was contemptible both n respect to numbers and character, and that it had terminated almost where it began; and that the ensuing session should have been opened by a speech from the throne, acquainting Parliament, that the public tranquillity had experienced no further interruption, and that his Majesty indulged the hope that the deluded were convinced of their error and were returned to their allegiance: let it be imagined, I day, that, under such circumstances, a minister without the production of a single document, should demand from Parliament a renewal of a martial law bill, I solemnly put it to the honour of every member who hears me, whether he believes this house would adopt such a measure without even asking a question. Sir, it is my firm and honest conviction, that no minister would presume even to make such a proposition. If then we should not pass this bill in our own case without due proof of its necessity, what can be the sentiment of Ireland, if, in the instance of that part of the united kingdom, we should adopt if with the facility, which his Majesty's ministers seem to recommend to us. Here, Sir, is a source to me of very painful and anxious apprehensions. If we do treat the business of Ireland lightly and superficially if we do appear to act negligently towards her interests, we shall at the same time act offensively to her feelings. The people of that country may begin to draw very unpleasant contrasts, they may say \"in our local Parliament our affairs would have experienced a more grave and serious attention, our antient legislature would not have suspended our rights and privileges without adequate evidence of the urgency of the measure;\" and thus, Sir, do I dread that the substantial benefits of the union may tie frustrated, and that if his Majesty's servants persevere in their present deportment towards the affairs of Ireland, I may live to repent the vote I gave for the accomplishment of that great object. I perceive, by the gestures of the gentleman opposite to me, that they mean to accuse me of a course of argument injurious to the public welfare but they will do well to recollect, that100the mischief will be in their conduct; and not in my statement, and I have felt it my peculiar duty to seize this opportunity of expressing my sense of the danger of their system, because we are still in time to anticipate it. For the reasons I have assigned, Sir, I shall not negative the bill; I but I do most earnestly exhort and conjure his Majesty's ministers, for the dignity and character of our proceedings, for the sake of constitutional precedent, and injustice, as, well as policy towards Ireland, to defer its further stager., until sufficient parliamentary information, in respect to the situation of that part of the united kingdom, shall be furnished to the house.", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-elliot", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

The object of this bill was to make an alteration in that which made the volunteers effective men, and if this was done without the consent of the volunteer, it was a breach of: good faith with such a man. If this bill passed in the form in which it stood now, the condition of the volunteer was to be altered by it: he had not what was promised to him when he entered, and therefore this measure was a breach of good faith towards him, and that by Parliament; good faith ought to be strictly observed by every body, but more especially by Parliament. It was extremely important to observe, that in this volunteer service there was at present no sort of discipline in this great body, except the terms on which they had been accepted. Many of them had discipline within themselves, and which they observed for their own regulation and internal arrangement; but if Parliament interfered to impose on them some discipline to which they did not agree at the time their services were accepted, it would do that which it had no right to do, because it was altering the condition on which the volunteers entered, and they were entitled to insist on the terms on which they entered; and here he could not help saying, that part of the speech of the right hon. gent, under the gallery (Mr. Rose) appeared to him to have a mischievous tendency, because it went to favour that breach of faith. It was impossible, without breaking the condition on which the volunteer entered, to alter any of it, or to subject him to any thing else without breach of faith. It was said to be desirable to put the volunteers with the regiments of the line. That was indeed the case of those who might be called out under the defence act, but it was expressly otherwise with regard to the volunteers; for Parliament had expressly declared that the volunteers should not be called upon to join the regiments of the line, and to do otherwise now would be to violate the faith which was the basis of the volunteer service; and if it was persisted in to make that alteration, the engagement between government and the volunteers was dissolved; and if measures of this kind were to be insisted upon, he was afraid the country would be deprived of a great deal of service it might otherwise have.

If his Majesty's ministers have grounds sufficient to support so strong an act against a great portion of onr fellow-subjects in Ireland, and so alarming to every other part of the empire, they ought to state those grounds to Parliament. In fact, we are called upon to proceed, without evidence, in a manner which nothing but the clearest evidence can justify; that is, to put the kingdom of Ire-105land under martial law. I do not mean, said the hon. gent., to bring any charge against the government of Ireland. Until I know the contrary to be true, I must presume, that they have furnished his Majesty's ministers with facts and proofs adequate to the measure now recommended. What I complain of is, that ministers have not communicated those facts and that evidence, nor even the smallest part of it to the House of Commons. Necessity, I know, supersedes all argument. Let the case be ever so doubtful or questionable, or even criminal, it may find a justification in extreme necessity: but then, I say, prove it. You have no right to avail yourself of the plea until you have established the fact. All the evidence I have seen or heard of goes in the opposite direction. The only parliamentary document on his subject that has b en laid before the house, is that passage in his Majesty's speech which describes, in terms of the highest satisfaction, a general change in the disposition of his deluded subjects in Ireland, and his gracious confidence in the corrected judgment of those who had been misled. Out of doors, and even within these few days, I have heard no other language among persons most disposed to favour the present government.

The measure now proposed indicates that Ireland is in such a state, and the occasion so pressing, that nothing less than extreme courses can save it.&#x2014;If the case be as violent as the remedy supposes, undoubtedly his Majesty's ministers have a right to the remedy. If not, they call upon us to trust them with a dangerous power, which is not wanted, and by the very act of calling for it, run the risk of doing mischief in other senses, and counteracting their own purpose. By empowering the government of Ireland to proclaim martial law, they alienate the affections of the people whom they ought to conciliate, and, in effect, they invite and encourage the enemy to invade the empire in that quarter.

(Mr. Pole) had met the charge of his hon. friend (Colonel Craufurd), who did not say, that there was110not ammunition here and there, but spoke respecting the ammunition in the cartouch boxes of the soldiers. That part of the remark had not been answered. When he recurred to the observations of the noble lord, he had not so much to state arguments on the one side, as to speak of the want of them on the other. They were now about to renew martial law in Ireland, without having heard one single word to justify the measure. To vote the reestablishment of martial law seemed to be so much a matter of course, that it required no argument to support it. They stopped the constitution as a miller would stop a wind or a water-mill, and with as little consideration. The constitution was stop and set a going, was commanded to march or to halt, with as little ceremony as a colonel would use towards his battalion. He would not say this was wrong, but he wanted to know why it was right. It had been said that notoriety had been considered a good ground for voting a measure of this nature; this might be very true when rebellion was at the doors of those who voted such a measure, but no such reason existed now, and no other was given for it. They had been told of a danger which was at present invisible; this put him in mind of a dancer, who was described as turning round so quick, that he could not be seen to turn; which led somebody to observe, that perhaps he did not turn round at all; so as to this invisible danger: people might suspect, as nothing could be seen, that there was, perhaps, no danger at all. In the present instance, however, the difficulty was greater. He might discover from the mere light of nature, for to that he was left, the necessity of the present measure; but how was he to collect it from what ministers said? The whole of the inference that was to be drawn from their representations discountenanced the measure. He wished that ministers would tell them, when they should have made up their minds upon the subject, whether the late insurrection was really a contemptible riot; a mere effervescence of the moment, and confined to the spot on which it originated, or whether it spread to greater extent, and had taken deep root in the country? He wished that the hon. gentlemen on the other side of the house would deal fairly with them in that respect, and not, as at present, play fast and loose; seeking to have the benefit of suppositions both of which could not be true, like the student at one of the universities, who, upon being asked whether the sun went111round the earth, or the earth round the sun, answered, sometimes one and sometimes the other. So in the present case, sometimes ministers said the insurrection was a contemptible riot; at others, it was of such magnitude as to require a martial law bill. How could the house act? If they voted for the bill, they must vote for it in spite of the arguments of the ministers who supported it, and whose description of the event, which made the basis of their measure, was at one time a figure of stature to reach the skies, and at another, shrunk, like (he spirits in Pandemonium, to a pigmy size hardly capable of being discerned. The vigour of the measure might, according to the opinion of a noble lord (Lord Castlereagh), be a recommendation, and serve better to fulfil that assurance, which he mentioned himself to have given (and which no one could deny, was fully made good in the present instance), viz. that there would be no want of vigorous legislation in respect to the affairs of Ireland. But whatever might be said of the vigour of this proceeding, which, without a moment's consideration or a particle of evidence, put a great portion of the empire out of the protection of the constitution, he was afraid that much would not be said, or felt, of its kindness. It would be no great proof, either of our respect or sympathy for the people of Ireland, no good illustration of the advantages of the union, that we should be willing to exclude them for the time from the constitution, and put them under martial law, in circumstances of proof, in which no man would have ventured to hint at such a thing in respect to this country. Ministers might perhaps be satisfied with the panegyrics bestowed on these measures; great powers must be applied to great occasions, and on this ground the principle of arbitrary power might do good: despotism was neither good nor bad in itself, and if angels were always to rule, there would be no objection to it; but as this could not be the case, men were content to forego the advantages which a more direct and arbitrary use of power might confer, and to take up with the safer and slower operation of laws and free governments. In these measures they must look to the ministers who proposed them, and who were not entitled to confidence at all. If the statements of ministers were to be taken, these measures were not necessary. Here let the house recollect what took place in last July. Previous to the insurrection, they were told by ministers that Ireland was in a continual state112of improvement, and it was to be inferred, that every danger ought to be thrown oft their minds. Had any one at that time, proposed a martial law bill, what would have been thought of his conduct? Yet, why not? What had happened since, to change the determination of the house, or to render that necessary which was not necessary at the period above-mentioned? Up to the moment of the 23d of July, the house bad been told that all was tranquil in Ireland, and the country in a state of daily improvement. A few days subsequent to that date, news arrives, that an insurrection had broken out that the lord chief justice had been murdered, and the capital been within an ace of being taken. In the first paroxysm of their fears, ministers speak out, describe the proceeding as a dangerous rebellion, and call for an instant suspension of the habeas corpus, and for a martial law bill. As neither of these measures were wanted, for any object at that moment depending, as one of them was a mere measure of general precaution, and the other (the martial law bill) could not be applied to the trials of those already apprehended, with respect to all of whom, it was anex post factolaw, there seemed to be no reason, why, according to the ordinary practice of Parliament, the delay of a day should not be allowed for deliberation; a delay which would be nothing with respect to the measure, but was a great deal with respect to the better understanding the event, on which the measure was to be founded. On some subjects, an additional four-and-twenty hours could add nothing to our knowledge, nor be expected to make much change in our opinion. On the subject of the late peace, for instance, or of the French revolution, a man was not likely to think at the end of any four-and-twenty hours now taken, differently from what he had done at the beginning. It would be useless therefore to delay a decision, with a view to what such an interval might produce. But, in the present case, four-and-twenty hours was nearly equal to the whole period that the event had been known to us, an event too, on which the letters of every pest, were giving us further and better information. On these ideas he had urged, that after an assurance to his Majesty, of the determination of the house to support his Majesty against all dangers, and to adopt whatever measures should be necessary for that purpose, they should have paused till the next day, to determine what those measures ought to be. This proposal was over-ruled, and he was treated as little less than a person disaffected, who, before113a bill was pased, such as the martial law bill, could suggest the propriety of a moment's delay, till his Majesty's ministers should have settled in their own minds, whether the event in question was a serious rebellion, or only an accidental riot. The decision was now made for an accidental riot. And it was declared, that from some causes or other, from the security necessarily exercised, and which, it seems, have had the effect, not only of intimidating and cutting off the usual effects of severity, but even ofconciliatingthe disaffected, Ireland was in a better state than ever, less filled with a disposition to mischief, and with better means of resisting, should any be attempted. The consequence of all this would seem to be, that a suspension of the habeas corpus, and a martial law bill, which were not necessary before the 23d of July, must be still further from being necessary now. And this inference was further confirmed, by the circumstance so much insisted upon by ministers, that the powers granted at the period alluded to, had never been acted upon, but in one instance. He was the farthest from meaning to contend, that a power not acted upon, and a power not possessed, were one and the same thing; or, that a power known to be possessed, might not produce great effects, even though it should never be called forth into action. But, at least, it must be admitted, that a power so circumstanced, that is to say, which in the course of many months had never been wanted, or never used, was not one, which required such hasty proceedings, as those which took place at the period above referred to, or which could claim to be renewed, without one single fact or argument adduced to shew that it was necessary. If no facts or arguments were adduced, as little could it be said, that the house had any authority to act upon. The authority, if any, must be that of his Majesty's ministers; and what must their authority be held to be, whose total ignorance or criminal neglect, had exposed the capitad of part of the empire to be within an ace of being surprised, (he was glad to repeat the expression) at a moment when they were preaching every where the tranquil state of the country. This topic, the hon. gentleman wished to get rid of, by a new kind of doctrine, namely, that nothing should be said of the conduct of ministers, unless produced in the shape of a distinct charge. He had no objection to distinct charges, wherever the magnitude of the object, the circumstances of the case, and the time of the house would admit of them; which latter consideration alone might, in114the multitude of charges liable to be made against the hon. gentlemen, be a reason against that course. But however this might be, it would be a whimsical rule to lay down, thatunlessthese charges, oruntilthese charges were brought, no observations were to be made upon the conduct of men in public stations, even where their conduct furnished, as in the case before them, an argument essentially interwoven with the subject in discussions The authority of ministers constituted, in the present instance, ail the public and parliamentary grounds which the house had to stand upon. It was of some consequence, therefore, to ascertain what that authority was 5 and no single instance could better illustrate it, than that which was afforded by the 23d of July. He was amazed at the account which government had finally resolved to give of that transaction. They had to chase between neglect and surprise. If they knew nothing or what was coming on, if they were really in the opinions, which they thought proper to profess, that all was tranquil in Ireland, and nothing meditating against the government, then they were surprized, and must I take the shame which belongs to that confession. It, on the contrary, they chose to disclaim this ignorance of the state of the country, and this want of information as to what was passing under their noses, then they must confess 3 degree of neglect, not merely disgraceful, but such as was in the strictest sense criminal To his utter astonihment they made their election for the neglect. Having the choice of two interpretations, being returned, as it were, for two places, the one which they chose, the one for which they finally took their seat, was that which put them in the situation of declaring, that knowing the mischief to be coming on, knowing that an insurrection was likely to take place, they calmly and advisedly suffered it to take its course, neglecting those precautions, which would hale said the life of; the chief justice, and have put the city in a state of perfect security; instead of leaving it, as they did, to be preserved by the merest chance from falling into do hands of the rebels. This account of the transaction, as I given by the hon. gentleman, was striking in the first instance, from the utter impossibility of reconciling it with known and acknowledged facts it was not very easy to understand, how that could be otherwise than a surprize, which found the lord mayor without notice; the commander in chief without instructions, at least without permission. feely to act upon his instructions; the troops, in part, without ammunition; and115the lord lieutenant absent from the castle, He was prepared to say, that much of the ammunition supplied to the yeomanry (troops that had their full share in what was done) was not brought to them till after the action had commenced, and when there was the most imminent risk, that both the ammunition itself, as well as those who escorted it, would have been intercepted by the rebels. If this was not a surprize, he should be glad to know, what in the ministerial vocabulary was to be so denominated. But the account was not less singular, if adopted by the hon. gentleman, on any principle of choice. On what possible supposition was the lord lieutenant's absence from the castle to be accounted for, it not on that of surprize, and of his being ignorant of the explosion which was about to take place? What the lord lieutenant absent at his country house, at a moment when he knew that an insurrection was likely to break out in the city! And this the statement made by his friends! He could only say, in the words of Hamlet, 'I would not hear thine enemy say so. He would not have so shocked the ears of a right hon. gentleman opposite to him (Mr. Yorke) or have so isolated his own convictions, as to have advanced an opinion, pregnant with such injurious reflexions, to the noble lord at the head of the Irish government. But, in whatever way the fact was to be accounted for, to whichever change the government would choose is plead guilty, their authority upon the subject of Irish affairs was at an end. If the measure proposed was to be adopted, it must be, not in consequence of the representations made by government, but in spite of them. They had described the proceedings of the 23d of July as a contemptible riot: that had declared the state of the country to have been improved by those proceedings, instead of being made worse. The best plea which they could urge, and one certainly which they would be able to make cut, was that they knew nothing of the matter. Yet, in this state of things, the house was called upon to voie a martial law bill, without a single proof adduced of the necessity of it, and upon grounds too that would equally serve for any other time as well as the present. For if this measure was to as a noble lord had declared, precautionary, and that that precaution was to be founded upon the mere fact of an insurrection having broken out, this tact would continue to be true to the end of time; and whenever it could be coupled with a war, might be made the foundation of a measure such as was then proposed. It was impossible to say, bow long, according to the pre-116sent mode of reasoning, its influence in that respect might last.&#x2014;Upon the whole, the measure as now proposed, was utterly without foundation to stand on. What it might I be in itself, was not so properly the object of inquiry. He could very well conceive, judging from views the very reverse of those commonly held out by the hon. gentlemen, that the course proposed, desperate as it was,mightbe necessary. He was afraid, at least, in so critical a case, to say that it was not so. Contrary, therefore, to the general rule, which would direct in every case, and still more in one like the present, the rejection of every measure, of which no strong reason had been' urged for the support, he should acquiesce in the one now proposed, protesting against the manner in which it had been brought forward, and begging to have it understood, that so far as he might concur in it, it was for reasons wholly different from those which could be derived from the language or conduct of the hon. gentlemen.", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-windham-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

He did not coincide in the sentiments of the right hon. gentleman, who had argued, that a despotic government would be the best of all governments, if administered by angels.

With regard to the suspension of theHabeas Corpus Act, it was a measure of a very different nature from the present. That was a measure of precaution, this of punishment, and of punishment in a manner which was looked upon by the constitution with peculiar jealousy. It was barely tolerated, never praised. An assertion had been made that similar bills had been passed by the United Parliament without enquiry. This assertion w as not borne out by the fact. He had himself on a former occasion voted for the measure, because, from the proclamation, he was led to believe that a necessity existed But, what document was there before the House to prove the existence of any such necessity at this moment? The evidence, such as it was, led to a contrary conclusion. It was now acknowledged that the murder of Lord Kilwarden was not the effect of a premeditated plan, but had taken place from his being the first person who was presented to the fury of the mob. But it was on the ground of the law being more directly struck at in the person of one of its chief administrators, that he had voted for theMartial Law Bill. On the other side, a hope had been expressed by his Majesty, that his deluded subjects were returning to a state of obedience. By one gentleman the notoriety of the necessity had been urged by another it had been stated, that an invisible necessity existed. (Lord Castlereagh here said, that he had not called it an invisible necessity, he had said, that there was a necessity though not visible.) The hon. member then proceeded, to say, that he would leave the noble lord to explain to the House the distinction, and, in compliment to him, would use the term non-visible, instead of invisible. The necessity was not visible, and the notoriety which had been mentioned was, he supposed, not audible. The law, it was acknowledged, had never been acted upon, but in one solitary instance, and in that one instance he would assert, that it had been125misapplied. It had been directed to the punishment of a man who had attempted to seduce the soldiers from their allegiance; an act, which, though perhaps, even more criminal than open violence, did not come within the meaning of the statute. The hon. member noticed the assertion made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that it had been in the contemplation of some members of the Irish government to propose the enactment of Martial Law previous to the 23d of July, and he contrasted it with the declaration of the right hon. gent, only live days before the insurrection, that there was more loyalty in Ireland than ever, and that tranquillity was perfectly secure. Should a distinct enquiry into the business of the 23d of July ever take place, he hoped the right hon. gentleman would take for his defence, ground a little more tenable than that on which he stood at present. With respect to the measure now before the House, he wished the House to consider what had been the policy of our ancestors, when called upon for extraordinary powers, even under circumstances of great danger. In the reign of Edward III. ministers came to the House for advice, and stated, that in divers counties, cities, and towns, ill-disposed men had leagued together, and sworn, when they should receive news agreeable to their desires, to rise, to rob and murder their neighbours, and procure a general insurrection throughout the land. This was at a period when die King was with his army in France, and the news, which was desired by the ill-disposed, was no less than the ruin of that army, at the head of which was the Sovereign. In this situation what was done by the House of Commons? Did it declare martial law? No. It answered, that if the guardians of the peace were not capable of performing their duty, they must be reinforced by ethers more sufficient, and that no persons arrested must be released on bail till they were delivered by persons of sufficiency, and she most respectable of the country, such as knights and Serjeants. This last clause was in effect a mitigated suspension of theHabeas Corpus Act. Such was the wisdom of our ancestors. Here was no recourse to martial law, a sort of law, which, even in its best form, was alien to the constitution. But, the mania] law they were now called on to sanction, was of an aggravated nature. It had none of those checks which had been carefully introduced into the old martial law to modify and correct the virulence of its operation. The learned member then entered into a view of martial law. It took its rise, he said, from the ancient126Courts of Chivalry, and the administration of it was originally presided over by a person professing the law. Under theMutiny Bill, courts martial were to consist of thirteen officers, and one of them was to be a field-officer; thus preserving the appearance of a judge and jury. The culprit too, was entitled to a copy of the proceedings and the sentence. In short, there had been always an endeavour to make the martial law as like the constitutional law as possible. In the present instance all these ideas were abandoned. Courts martial were allowed to be formed by a smaller number of officers, than, under theMutiny Bill, was allowed in any port of the British dominions, with the exception only of the slave coast and Botany Bay, where, from circumstances, it was impossible to apply the general rule. From the first of these places, he was sure one hon. member (Mr. Wilberforce,) would not be ready to draw any precedent; and he was himself, and he believed the House would be, as little disposed to take one from the second. It was utterly impossible to assign any reason why, in a country like Ireland where so large an army was stationed, so small a number of offices was allowed to forma court martial. A want of officers could certainly not be pleaded. The learned member then urged the impolicy of suffering martial law to remain in existence a moment longer than was absolutely necessary. To shorten the dominion of the sword, and to bring back society to its original state, had always been the wish of every wise legislator. In the opinion of mankind no disgrace attached to the memory of those who fell in a state of warfare. But very different was the case of those who suffered by the operation of the laws. A solemn verdict of persons, who perhaps, were their neighbours, of men without passion or prejudice, established their guilt, and their guilt were for ever branded with ignominy. This was felt by one of the leaders of the late insurrection (Emmet) when he was taken, and an apology was made for his being hurt in the struggle, he replied, that every thing was fair in war; but when he was sentenced by a jury of his countrymen, his feelings ware very different: conscious of the shame that was incurred by his end, he desired that no man might write his epitaph. Having enforced, at considerable length, the various heads of argument, the hon. member concluded by expressing his disapprobation of the measure now before the House.", "author_id": "/people/mr-french-laurence", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

The hon. gentlemen seemed particularly prone to this course of proceeding. They were fond of driving to an inch, of running every thing to the last moment. The consequence was, as it necessarily must be, that being obliged to act in a hurry, whatever they did was crude, ill considered, and full of mistakes. There were two modes, Dr. Johnson had observed, of composition; one in which the several parts received from the writer, before they issued from his mind, all the perfection which he hoped to give to them; the other, in which they were committed to paper in the first instance to be improved by subsequent correction. The hon. gentlemen, by the circumstances in which they placed themselves so constantly, seemed to prefer the latter of these modes. They threw down their first loose thoughts in an act of Parliament, trusting to future consideration and experience to bring them to something of a better shape. An act of Parliament wa3 their foul copy, in which it did not signify how many faults there were, as the Legislature would be able afterwards to set them right. Their preference to this mode was founded, he supposed, upon the observation of the poet, that poetsLost half the praise they should have got,Were it but known, what they discreetly blot.The hon. gentlemen did not choose to lose335this praise. They chose to compose in public; and to have full credit both for their first conceptions, and for the successive improvements which changed them often to something utterly unlike what they had been originally. Though by this course of proceeding of the hon. gentlemen in the present instance, fee had lost the opportunity of suggesting his amendment in a stage when it might have been received, he should nevertheless mention it, with a view to occasions, when the volunteer system might be again under discussion. It was in fact, however, no more than what he had already urged on more occasions than one, viz. the putting a stop to exemptions with respect to those who should enter into volunteer corps in future. To abolish those already subsisting was, he was aware, difficult, and might perhaps be impossible. Certainly it ought not to be attempted, if it could not be put upon a footing to make it consistent with good faith. But the granting such exemptions in future, and continuing by design what had got a place in the system only by chance and against the intention of its authors, was a proceeding for which no rational motive could be assigned, and which he could not hear without great surprise as well as concern, was to make part of the present hill. What he had further to object being of 2 sort, which could not have been corrected by an amendment or clause was as proper (or more proper), to be urged on that day as on the day before. It was an objection to the whole system. While the right of exemption produced the effect on the one hand of defrauding the army, the army of reserve and the militia, by contracting the population, from which they were to be supplied, it oppressed the whole country, and particularly the lower orders, to a degree the most grievous, and by means the most intolerable that were ever admitted deliberately, into the institutions of any state. Where did any one ever hear, except as matter of complaint and reprobation, of a power such as that vested in the leaders of volunteer corps, whether one or many, of deciding arbitrarily and without appeal, who should or should not be liable to a ballot, the effects of which would be to the persons on whom it might fall, a fine of 40 or 50 guineas? These were sums which to the bulk of those who might be liable to them, would be nothing less than absolute ruin; at the same time that it might be equally ruin to them to quit their trades and their families and to engage for a service of five years, as soldiers. Such a power lodged in the hands of a commandant where the constitution of the336corps was monarchical, or in a committee or sub-committee, where its form was republican or democratical, would rank here after for oppression or abuse, with any of those most famous in history&#x2014;with the dispensing power or powers of granting indulgences. It was not that this power was applied abusively or oppressively, in many or perhaps in any instances, at present; but it could hardly fail to be so in the end, and in the mean-while must be considered as one wholly out of the course of all ordinary proceedings, and for which it was hardly possible to find a fit depositary. Such a power must however somewhere exist, supposing the privilege of exemption to continue: for it was impossible to imagine, that every one could be allowed to enter into a volunteer corps that pleased: and he or they, who had the power of admission or rejection, must possess the power here spoken of, improper and unsafe as that power might be. The only remedy was, either to abolish exemptions, or to abolish volunteer corp9. It seemed hardly possible to correct the evil by regulation. Nor was it to be conceived, that such evil had now become small, because the greater part of the militia and army of reserve were raised, and ballots of consequence to the same extent were no longer wanted. To the same extent they: certainly would not be wanted; but it must be considered at the same time, that they would have to operate upon diminished numbers: so that to supply and maintain the-present force, that is to say, to make good what was then wanting, and afterwards to maintain the whole (for which latter purpose too, as was obvious, more would be required the larger was the force already raised), would render these ballots perhaps not much less burthensome than they bad been at any preceding period.&#x2014;So much as to the oppression of this system, armed as it was. with a power such as he had described, which the present bill both confirmed and' extended, and which it seemed extremely difficult to take away. Its injurious effect on all the other species of force he must still' maintain, notwithstanding the specious statements made on the other side. First, as to the fact. Whatever the numbers might be, produced by recruiting during the last seven months, as compared with the produce of an equal number of months during an antecedent period, and however small the proportional dimininution which appeared to have taken place in the latter instance, he must still insist upon some strong and hard facts, namely, that in many regiments the returnpermonth was not more337than two, and sometimes not so much: and that in one of the largest recruiting districts, comprising many extensive and not unfavourable counties, the rate of recruitingpermonth was not more than seven or eight. Now, when this was so, let the gross numbers be what they would, he must contend that recruiting was nearly at a stand, taking the question upon the footing on which it ought to be taken, as a comparison between he supply and consumption, between what was gained to the army in recruits, and what was lost by desertion, death, invaliding, and discharges. But, next, as to the reasoning. Proportion, which the hon. gentlemen dwelt so much upon, that is to say, the proportionate abatement in the numbers at that time recruited, compared with those recruited in equal periods formerly, was not that on which the question properly turned. Proportion in abstract quantities had place among the smallest as perfectly as among the greatest. If the hon. gentlemen had a mind to be very deeply learned, they might tell us of the proportion of one nothing to anothernothingand such a consideration would be very far from inapplicable to much of their recruiting. But in common concerns they must apply to proportion, what is saidoflaw,de minimis non curat lex.If a regiment, which formerly recruited three a month, now recruited two, you were not obliged to say, that recruiting in that regiment had declined one-third, nor on the other hand could you be entitled to say, that it had declined one-third. Such variations would happen by chance, and by a law consequently wholly different from that of proportion. No conclusion, therefore, could be drawn from such instances separately considered: and if a judgment? were to be formed, as it ought to be, from the whole state of facts taken together, it would be the very reverse of that meant to be established by the hon. gentlemen; who, instead of saying the recruiting during the existence of these causes, (viz the immense bounties; the great extent of the militia force; the 400,000 men locked up as volunteers, &c.; has been so and so; therefore these causes have not operated to its disadvantage, ought to say, the recruiting being what it is, notwithstanding the operation of these causes, which must have acted so powerfully against it, what would ii not have been, had these been removed, and other new causes, which must be presumed to have arisen, have been left to produce their natural effect? This he must contend was the legitimate conclusion. It was not in the nature of things, that causes338such as he had enumerated, and were obvious to every one's observation, must not have some effect in checking the progress of recruiting. To take only one; could any man in his senses suppose, that with fifty guineas offered for service in the army of reserve, men would go on to enter for the line, at a bounty of five or ten, in the same manner as if no such competition existed? If the recruiting, therefore, kept up to nearly its former amount, as was contended by the hon. gentlemen, there must have been something to counteract the effect of these impediments; and this something it was not difficult to find. It was a state of war; it was the threat of invasion; it was thestimulusof the compulsory service; the discharge of numbers of workmen in consequence of temporary checks to trade; the general military spirit, that filled and animated every part of the country. These circumstances were of force sufficient to uphold, to a certain degree, the recruiting service, even in spite of the causes which tended to depress and to annihilate it. How far might they not have carried it, had there been nothing on the other side to counteract their effects?&#x2014;The objection, therefore, to the volunteer system as contributing with other causes, to destroy the recruiting of the army, continued in full force, even admitting the statements of the hon. gentlemen; and he must continue to urge these objections, even though he should be asked, as he was the other night, why he would persist in decrying a system, which, whether right or wrong, was now fixed and incapable of being altered. His answer was, that it was not fixed, but must, on the contrary, and infallibly would, and that, at no distant period, come again under revision; and that it was with a view to that period, that these observations were made; that the defects of this system were such as would never suffer it to go on long as it was; and that, if other causes were wanting, the very failure of its funds must soon bring it again before Parliament. Unless Parliament greased the wheels the machine must soon stand still. He wished, therefore, that before that time, gentlemen would be prepared with their opinions on the several parts of the measure; would consider how far the objections were valid; how far the parts objected to might be corrected or got rid of; and, failing of that, whether the whole system would not require to be new cast, and in great degree, possibly, to be done away.", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-windham-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1803", "dec", "14"], "content": "&#x2014;sir the right hon. gent who just sat down seems very desirous of having the last word on the subject new339before the House. I hope, however, shall I be permitted to express for the first, and perhaps the last time, my sentiments upon it. There are many points of the right hon. gentleman's speech on which I wish to make a few observations. The right hon. gent, and his associates in speaking of the volunteers, always ground what they say on a solitary instance. In the course of his speech, the right hon. gent, stated, that the subscriptions which have been raised to pay the expense of the formation of the corps of; volunteers would soon be exhausted, and that then they will be obliged to call on government to give them assistance for their future maintenance. Nothing can be more futile than this observation. In the first place, I conceive shat the right hon. gent, is completely misinformed in supposing, that subscriptions of the nature which he mentioned are raised at ail for the formation of corps of volunteers. I believe that there are many instances to the contrary; and I can assure the House, as one instance, that, towards the formation of a large corps which I have the honour and the happiness to command, there has been no subscription at all. The men were actually clothed out of the allowance made by government, with a very inconsiderable addition; and I feel a pride in stating, that not the smallest objection has been made by one individual to clothing of that description. It was not cloth at forty shillings a yard, to be sure, but the corps was extremely contented, and were not quite of an unsoldier-like appearance. Where there have been subscriptions, I conceive that they were directed principally to this object, and I am therefore at a loss to conceive how government need apprehend, even in the most distant perspective, that any call will be made on the public purse to afford any assistance, especially as it was generally understood that the clothing was to last three years.&#x2014;The right hon. gentleman has asserted, that no less a bounty than 50lper man has been given to substitutes for die army of reserve. Gentlemen en the other skis: of the House were fond of adverting to the solitary instance of the metropolis. To that fact I cannot speak; but I can assert, from my own knowledge, that in she county in which I reside, the price of a substitute is never more than 25 guineas, some times 20, and die average is 22&#x2014;In the same way, the right hon. gent, has argued on the argued on the committees. A solitary instance was stated on a former night, of a corps being governed by a committee. Ab uno disce omnes, is hardly a fair way of judging, I have seen many corps of volun-340teers, and have heard of more, but I know of no such regulations. The system is a bad one; nothing should induce me to hold any commission in such a corps, or to have any thing to do with it, It is an unfair mode of arguing, to infer, that because there was one solitary instance, it must be the general description of volunteer corps. I have, indeed, read such arguments of late, but I little expected to have heard them urged by gentlemen of enlightened understandings.&#x2014;As to the injury done to the recruiting service, that point has been completely answered by the statement of the Secretary at War., and by other gentlemen. Facts cannot be done away by the loose and vague opinions of individuals. They are so unanswerable, that I shall not dwell on this objection.&#x2014;I mean nothing offensive to the right hon. gent, in what I am going to add: but I must; once for all express my grief and my astonishment, that the right hon. gent, should have adopted, and now persevere in a course of language, disparaging, discountenancing, and discrediting a description of men, on whose services the safety of the country not a little depends. The right hon. gent, perhaps, despises popularity; I am nevertheless astonished that, without any adequate reason, he should set himself in opposition to the universal voice. But I will tell that right hon. gent, that every corner of the kingdom echoes its reprobation of the language which he has held since the meeting of Parliament, People cannot comprehend, posterity will scarcely believe, that in a moment of danger so unparalleled, one individual could be found, who would gravely assert, that 400,000 Britons in arms were not I only doing no good, but were even injurious to the interests and defence of the country.; Is the right hon. gent, so grossly ignorant of ancient and modern history, as not to know; what glorious exploits have been performed by the patriotic and voluntary energy of men like our volunteers? Such examples will not be lost, I am confident, on my countrymen If real danger should present itself, what may not be expected from men, animated with one spirit, fired with an unexampled unanimity, to lake arms in defence of a monarch whom they love, of a constitution which they revere, of an independence which they cherish, and for the protection of every thing that can be valuable and precious to them as men and as Englishmen.", "author_id": "/people/mr-henry-addington", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

This was a point, he thought, essential to the interest of the country. A strong line of demarcation ought to be made. He had looked into the acts of Parliament on the subject of the volunteer exemptions, and he found that he was borne out in what he then asserted, that the volunteers under the 42d of the King, were of a different class in the eye of the legislature from the present volunteers, who bad no regulation but that of the 43d of the King. The latter were a very large body of men, by whose exemption the great mass of the population of the country was greatly affected; they impeded very much indeed the progress of the army of reserve, for three-fourths of them were of the first class of theDefence Act, unmarried mm under the age of thirty: this was a serious matter: they ought not to have these exemptions, for it was greatly inconvenient to the country. As to the volunteers under the 42d of the King, who were the only tree volunteers, in the proper344sense of the. word, for they came forward without any view of exemption; they were justly entitled to every exemption; they were in number from 69,000 to 70,000, and they were a body of men, on whom the country need not less rely for patriotism than for discipline; but the other great body which had been lately raised, and had entered, was not so properly called a body of volunteers, although that name had been given to them. They were not at first to have been exempted, either from the militia or the army of reserve: by the act of the 17th of July, no intention was expressed of exempting any of them either from the militia, army of reserve, or oilier service; but on the 11th of August, when many gentlemen had gone into the country in hopes of serving it as essentially as they could by attending that House, a clause crept into a bill for regulating the volunteer cavalry, by which all this immense body of men were exempted from all other services, as it was now to be interpreted by the present bill, but which could hardly have been then so intended, as indeed was to be gathered by the very necessity there was now of explaining that act. This was a matter worthy the serious attention of the House at some future period. By these 300,000 men being thus entitled to exemption from the militia and the army of reserve, and three-fourths of them being of the first class of requisition under theDefence Act, being unmarried men under the age of thirty, this threw all the ballots almost upon men who had families, and they wishing to remain with and provide for them, of course became eager for substitutes, so that a great competition arose among them, and the effect was the bounty for substitutes became enormous. These were matters to be considered gravely; not that he wished cur military strength to be; diminished by any means; no, we must continue that strength while the affairs of Europe wore their present aspect. It was no matter to us whether Buonapart&#x00E9; existed or not, while France was the military nation she was, we must bear a relative proportion to that military power. He admitted, however, that no addition ought to be made to the condition of any man who entered into his military service that would be a breach of faith&#x2014;The hon. baronet then took up the subject of popularity, as stated by Mr. Hiley Addington, and said, that his right hon. friend (Mr. Windham) could never be, unpopular among those who knew how to value a man versed in ancient, and intimately acquainted with every branch of modern learning, who knew how to esteem private345worth and public virtue. As to the \"gross ignorance\" which the right hon. gent. had thought proper to apply to his light hon. friend, he was astonished, and he believed that every member present was also astonished, that it should ever have entered into the head of that gentleman to make an insinuation of so extravagant a nature.&#x2014;He concluded by insisting on the distinction which he had taken between the two classes of volunteers, those of the 42d, arid those of the 43d of the King; the first he thought entitled to ail exemptions, the other to none.", "author_id": "/people/sir-william-young-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

Birmingham, Sheffield, Manchester, and various other manufacturing towns, as the returns from those towns would prove. These men, when they were unemployed, and saw no chance of being reinstated, immediately formed the idea of enlisting in the line or militia; and instead of going from town to town to look for higher bounties, repaired to the next town where they could be received; and this would account for the difference of facility in raising recruits in the country. With respect to the volunteers themselves, as lie had not had an opportunity of speaking his sentiments, he wished to say a few words. It had been pretty much the fashion to charge a right hon. gent, near him (Mr. Windham) with disparaging those corps, as utterly useless and unfit for service.

For his own part, however, he felt no disposition to undervalue the services of the volunteers; on the contrary, he thought they would be rendered highly serviceable and efficient for the defence of the country. As to discipline, however, as compared with troops of the line, or established militia, that was out of the question. The nature of the service, and the opportunities that had occurred for training the volunteers, admitted of no comparison with the other troops, In aid of those troops, however, he thought they would form an important branch of the pub-346lic force; and he thought that as that service must depend chiefly on the high spirit and good will of the corps, a liberal conduct from those who were to direct their operations should be observed, and that government should not be over nice or strict in the minuter details of their discipline.", "author_id": "/people/mr-john-calcraft-2", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

The latter were not entitled to, nor did they ever look for exemptions; though the hon. baronet had stated generally, that almost all the men in the country, capable of military service, were locked up in the volunteers; and that of course the exemptions were so extensive, that it would be found quite impossible to provide recruits for the regular army.

It. had been the fashion, he said, for his Majesty's ministers and their supporters, to endeavour to calumniate, and run down the characters of those men who have the honesty and the boldness to deliver their candid sentiments in that House, in opposition to the measures of ministers, which, they conceived to be impolitic; regardless of that temporary popularity which ministers were so anxious to obtain from gratifying the whim of the moment without looking to future results. Of this illiberal disposition too many instances had been given with respect to the conduct of his right hon. friend (Mr. Windham), the purity of whose motives no man could question, and the ability of whose; mind even his adversaries were forced to; acknowledge; but yet he was the subject of much undeserved censure, and extremely culpable misrepresentation. The latter, some persons out of doors seemed encouraged to promote; and the effect of that348misrepresentation in the circles of the minister's friends, was quoted in that House as an objection to his right hon. friend's opinion A right hon. gent, on the other side of the House, whom he did not now see in his place (Mr. H. Addington), had this night stated, in a very confident tone, that his right hon. friend was unpopular; he had expressed his astonishment at the sedulous perseverance of his right hon. friend, in reprobating the volunteers, and asserted that every corner of the country echoed with censure, disapprobation, and disgust, at the conduct of his rt. hon. friend. What, he would ask, was the cry of unpopularity, even if it attached to a particular course of policy, to weigh with the mind of an enlightened statesman, to urge him to the abandonment of that course, against the conviction of his own judgment The idea was too ridiculous to be entertained. No sound politician could support it. That popularity was highly desirable, was an indisputable proposition, because it was, independently of other considerations, a powerful instrument for a politician to work with; and, whatever the advocates of ministers might assert or insinuate, he would contend, that his right hon. friend did possess a very high degree of popularity, which was particularly owing to his opposition to the volunteer system. This fact he knew from his acquaintance with the sentiments of the people throughout the country, and particularly those of the more intelligent description. He said he was himself present when a large company, consisting principally of the friends of administration, drank that gentleman's health, and made him the bearer of a complimentary message to him, for the part he had taken with regard to this subject. The learned member observed, that the company he alluded to was composed of men whose talents and characters were such as to entitle their opinion to respect&#x2014;men to be esteemed by whom was indeed a flattering evidence of the popularity which his right hon. friend enjoyed; and he could not help saying, that any people who could condemn the motives which manifestly actuated his right hon. friend, or who could not respect the line of public conduct which he had pursued, were incapable of understanding their own interests, were scarcely worthy to be served. Yet, however much he regarded public opinion, however much he respected popularity, he must observe, that too much was generally said in that House about following the sentiments of the people, for if the people349were always to be followed, for what purpose were some persons, selected to lead? No national man would wish to render himself obnoxious to the people, but yet no intelligent and dignified statesman would shrink from his purpose from fear of popularity, for it was notorious that the people were too apt to consult their immediate ease, and but seldom to look to future interests, however important they might be. Ministers, if they were wise, should rather encourage than attempt to depreciate an opposition, from which they might obtain he most useful advice. In many cases, indeed, they had acted upon advice derived from that quarter, although so forward to traduce its consequence, at the time it was offered. Ministers were told by his right hon. friend, that if the dangers of the country were fully made known, the spirit of the people would be found ready to meet it, and this appeared from the result; but the complaint of his right hon. friend now was, that that spirit was ill directed, that the Slower of the military strength of the country was locked up in the volunteer system, and that the volunteers were governed by committees which were likely to become the focus of democracy. That such committees did exist was a fact quite notorious, arid that six privates had, from their institution, the power of governing a whole corps, officers included, and or arranging every thing connected with its internal conduct, enforcing the attendance members, infliction of fines, &c;&#x2014;With respect to the allusions made to the amount of the bounties given to the substitutes for the Army of Reserve, he could say from his own knowledge, that not less than 50&#x00A3;0 guineas were offered for substitutes in Middlesex. A man was known to hold a paper, pasted on the top of a pole, at Charing Cross, with an inscription of \"50 guineas for a substitute;\" and his hon. friend had said, that 100 guineas had been advertised for two substitutes at the Market Place of Norwich.

It was scarcely probable, therefore, that a man in such circumstances should have left his affairs in such a situation, as not again to require his personal presence. The hon.gent. entered further into a minute discussion of the observations of the Attorney General on the preceding evening, and endeavoured to obviate that right hon. gentleman's objections. He stated, that it would be a very hard case, indeed, if gentlemen should be excluded from attendance on their own private and most interesting affairs; affairs in which their happiness and personal respectability were deeply implicated, merely because they had been appointed on a committee, the business of which might be otherwise executed without, injury to the public.

{"date": ["1803", "nov", "23"], "content": "rose and addressed the chain as follows: Sir; I offer myself to day to your notice, not with a view of retracting in any degree the assent which I gave yesterday in a former stage of this address, but simply for the purpose of marking more distinctly the grounds of that assent, and obviating a misconstruction which might be liable to arise upon it. I wished the question to pass unanimously yesterday, for the same reasons which make me wish it to pass unanimously to day; namely, that nothing may seem to call in question the unanimity or our determination to give to his Majesty unbounded support, and to maintain the cause of the country through every possible trial, and to the last extremity. I should be sorry that any thing should appear on the face of our debates, which, in the mind even of the most rude observer, could create a doubt upon that subject. But while we are guarding against an error of this sort, let us take care not to incur one of an opposite tendency; that, namely, which would suppose, that unanimity in support of the country was unanimity in support of the ministers. There maybe some possibly, who think, as there are many, undoubtedly, who wish to have it thought, that the greater the dangers and difficulties of the country are, by whatever causes brought on, the greater must our acquiesence be in the ministry of the time being, and the more complete our forbearance of all that is usually called opposition. And if by opposition is meant a captious and vexatious opposition, an opposition on things of doubtful nature or inferior consequence, an opposition for the purpose of impeding ministers and making the government difficult to them, the opinion is certainly well founded. What it would be hard to justify at any time, must be wholly unjustifiable in circumstances such as those supposed. But35if there are persons, who think that of the danger here alleged as a reason for supporting ministers, the ministers themselves form the principal part; that the preparations of the enemy, however menacing, would have little terror, if met with wisdom and ability; that the seat of the evil is here rather than abroad; that it is the weakness of the defence, and not the vigour of the attack that constitutes the danger; that Buonaparte and his legions, however terrific, are not half so terrific as the little band which we see before us on the Treasury Bench; if there are persons who hold these opinions, to such persons it would be idle to say, that, for fear of exposing the weakness or lessening the authority of ministers, they were to stand quiet spectators of what was passing, and were neither to attempt to prevent the mischief, nor point out the source from which they conceived it to proceed. Such is the situation in which I feelmyselfstand. I have no wish, and in one view certainly have no right, to speak with slight or disparagement of the abilities of the hon. gentlemen. Individually considered, they are all men of cultivated minds, of liberal education, of good natural endowments, not unread in the history of their country, not unpractised in its business, not unprovided with those talents and acquirements which are necessary for the conducting of business in this House. But if I am to speak of them collectively, as men forming the council which is to guide the affairs of a great empire, which is to rule the world in a crisis like the present, I must say, from whatever causes it arises, that they are weakness itself. I really believe the country will perish in their hands. I believe the hon. gentlemen will fairly see us out; that we shall not outlive their administration; that they will prove, as I believe, I once before took the liberty of remarking to them, theAngustuliin whose hands the empire will fall. There is an old joke which we may remember, of Cicero's, who when some person had ceased to be Consul on the same day on which he had been made, observed, that the person in question might tell of a prodigy which few of his predecessors could boast, for, that the sun had never set during his consulate. I wish that something equally prodigious may not be found in the history of the hon. gentlemen, and that it may not be to be said of them hereafter, that their administration lasted as long as the country.&#x2014;It is now just two yean and a few weeks since I felt myself compelled to say to them in this place, and upon something of a similar oc-36casion, namely, the first day of the meeting of Parliament, \"that they had signed the death warrant of their country.\" * The affairs of the country have been in their hands, without interruption, from that day to this. And can we venture to say, that the gloomy forebodings then expressed have made no progress towards their accomplishment, or that the hon. gentlemen do not bid fairer to put the fuddling stroke to the work which they were then supposed to have begun? With these impressions, it is childish to talk of forbearing opposition, in cases where opposition would otherwise be proper, for fear of impeding the exertions of the hon. gentlemen, or exciting a belief that the country was not safe in their hands. Were I to forbear any opportunities of so doing, I am sure it must be from motives far different from those of regard for the safety of the country.&#x2014;With respect to the address itself, notwithstanding the care which has been taken, and properly taken, to avoid any occasion of difference, objections to it would not be wanting, were this the moment for insisting upon ihem.&#x2014;In point of taste, I could have wished, that less even had been said, than has been, of the conquests in the West Indies, and the impression thereby made on the enemy. Wretched, indeed, must be our view of things, if, at a moment like the present, we can amuse ourselves with such objects, and not see, that to the contempt in which the enemy holds them compared with the immense projects which, he is meditating, we owe, in great measure, the facility with which they have fallen into our hands.&#x2014;Upon the subject of Ireland, I agree entirely in the remarks made yesterday by an honourable gentleman (Mr. Fox), that the hope expressed is too sanguine, either for the nature of the thing, or for any confidence to be reposed in the testimony, on which we receive it. I agree with him also, in the fears which I understood him to express,&#x2014;fears very far from being allayed by what we have heard subsequently,&#x2014;that the views entertained respecting Ireland, and seeming in some degree to*The following is the passage to which Mr. Windham alludes.&#x2014;\"Sir, I speak in perfect plainness and sincerity, from the bottom of my heart, and with the solennito of a death-bed declaration a situation much ressembling that in which we all stand), when I declare, that my honourable friends, who, in a moment of rashness and weakness, have fatally put their hands to this treaty, have signed the death warrant to their country They have given it a blow, under which it may languish for a few years, but from which I do not conceive how it is possible for it ever to recover,\" See Political Register, Vol 2, p. 1093.37be indicated in the speech, were far from being of a sort which promised tranquillity or safety to that kingdom. But the part perhaps of the address most objectionable, is that concluding paragraph, which speaks of the issue of the present contest. The language there held has too much tendency to countenance a notion, than which nothing can be more false and foolish, that by the issue of the present contest is to be under stood only the issue of the invasion; which once past and decided in our favour, all be yond is to be security and glory. We know how readily the minds of men out of doors, will run into such a notion, and we may suspect even some of a higher description within these walls; but nothing could be more disgraceful or fatal than that such a notion should appear for a moment to be recognized by the house at large. This is all that I wish to say upon the subject of the present address, either generally or in detail.&#x2014;One word more only, upon a matter of a different sort, and which I am tempted to introduce to day, principally because it is the first occasion that offers, and because no man can say, in our present circumstances, whether the first occasion may not be the last, nor how soon we may be called away, as was observed by an honourable gentleman yesterday, to the performance of duties more active at least, if not more important, than those which we have to discharge in this house&#x2014;It will equally with the other subjects which I have touched upon, lead to no debate, nor require from the honourable gentlemen opposite to me, even an answer.&#x2014;I am come, in common with many other gentlemen, from a residence of some time in my own country: and upon the result of that residence, what I have to declare is, that should any great stroke be struck in the county of Norfolk, of the sort that has been pointed out to the honourable gentlemen, and for want of those precautions, which have likewise been pointed out to them; I shall, certainly, think, that there will be grounds of serious criminal charge against the honourable gent. and should the case not be such as, by the very magnitude of the evil, to put an end to all proceedings, to sweep away both accuser and accusation, 'To take at once the poet and the song,' I shall probably feel it my duty to stand forward as the bringer of that charge.&#x2014;More than this upon the present occasion need not be said, nor could, perhaps, be said with propriety. I had prepared, before I left Norfolk, a representation upon the subject,38and proposed it to a meeting of gentlemen assembled for other county business, wishing to have transmitted it to government with the advantage of their signatures: but, for reasons, which they, of course, thought satisfactory, which were not explained, as in fact no discussion was invited, and which I shall not presume to guess at, they declined to join in the representation. It was my duty to afford them the opportunity; as I conceive it to have been my duty now to mention the subject in the way that I have done.&#x2014;The honourable gentlemen will not consider me as bringing a charge against them, at least not one of which it is necessary for them to take notice, as it must rest for the present solely on the authority of the individual who brings it, unsupported by any proof. As a menace even, the honourable gentlemen will be entitled to hold it cheap, if they are confident that no blame can be imputed to them, but that every thing has been done, that can or ought to be done. It is as a menace, however, that I intend it; as the only means which I now possess of compelling attention to objects, which, in my apprehension at least, require to be attended to. This is all that I have to say upon this point. Upon the general topick, I trust I have sufficiently explained myself, and shall therefore no longer detain the house from voting the present address, with that unanimity, which, under the explanation now given, I shall be happy to see it received. The address was then read a second time, agreed to, and ordered to be presented to His Majesty by the whole house; and those members who were of His Majesty's most honourable privy council were ordered humbly to know His Majesty's pleasure when he would be graciously pleased to receive the same.", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-windham-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

{"date": ["1803", "dec", "07"], "content": "said, it was not his intention to trouble the house with any long or minute discussion. With regard to the necessity of the measure now before the house, he believed there could be only one opinion. He rose, not to oppose the measure nor to deny its necessity, for he was of opinion that such a measure was really necessary in the present circumstances of Ireland, and that it had been suggested by the imperious dictates of necessity alone. The only difference that existed between him and the framers of the bill, was in regard to the mode of carrying it into execution.&#x2014;He did not wish to trouble the house, but he wished to propose some amendment in regard to the constitution of those courts martial to which the bill alluded. He thought, unless in a case of the most impe-140rious necessity, and suggested by the strongest reasons of expediency, no court martial ought to be permitted to sit in such instances which was not composed of seven members at least. If circumstances unhappily required the interference of such courts, it ought to be an object with the legislature to invest them with as much wisdom and deliberative justice as the nature of the case would possibly admit. The number constituting such courts, he thought, ought never to be more than thirteen nor less than seven. There was not less danger from too many than from too few, in the determination of such cases as might come before them. The age of individuals composing those courts, he thought also, ought to be particularly attended to. It was well known, that in the army there were many young men officers, who had not arrived at that age which the laws of the country have wisely fixed as necessary to enable a man to have the conduct of his own private affairs. And could it for a moment be thought prudent that we should entrust the lives of our fellow citizens to men whom the laws of the country had judged incompetent to the management of their own private affairs? He thought it was indispensably necessary that the legislature should provide that no minor, that no man under the legal age, should be permitted to sit in any such courts martial. The measure, he allowed, was necessary; but it ought to be the care of that house to appear reluctant to deviate in any degree from the ordinary exercise of the laws t they ought to appear scrupulous in the adoption of any harsh or severe measure, and to remove as much as possible from its mode of execution the appearance of all harshness, injustice, or severity. This he thought might be done by the provisions which he wished to propose as an amendment. He could not conceive that these alterations would render the measure in any shape less effectual. Did he apprehend this as the consequence, he would be the last man to propose them. He knew, indeed, very well, that the government of Ireland would not wish to exercise any authority put into their hands, with greater severity than the urgency of circumstances might require. But while he was perfectly conscious of this, he, at the same time, wished that the legislature should not trust to any individuals for the Upright or lenient execution of any measure; but should prescribe to them their duty by the letter of the law.&#x2014;What is the circumstance, the hon. gent, asked, that endears the trial by jury to every man of this country? Is not every member of that141jury liable to be reduced to the same circumstances of the person standing charged before him? Is there not a sympathy subsisting hetween the jurors and the persons whom they try&#x2014;a sympathy that gives confidence to every man, that, if he has justice and equity on his side, it is the interest and congenial to the feelings of the jury to acquit him? In an ordinary court martial also, the officers composing that court martial were called to the trial of men of their own character and profession&#x2014;men who had been similar to themselves, and to whose circumstances they were uncertain but they themselves might likewise, at some fnture period, be reduced. Here also there existed that sympathy and fellow feeling which operated in favour of the person to be tried. But the circumstances of a court martial trying criminals accused of rebellion were very different. The persons brought before them had different interests, and would seem to be almost of a different species. From the circumstances of a country in such a situation, they were too apt to meet their victims with anger and passion, which must ever be hostile to the deliberative measures either of justice or mercy. They feel too great an interest as a party to listen with that partiality which ought always to be extended to the unfortunate. If such would naturally be the case with almost all men in such circumstances, how much more ought the house to guard against the passions or prejudices of rash, unthinking, or unfeeling youth. In some instances he was aware the amendment he proposed to make might be attended with difficulty; but the lord lieutenant, he thought, might in such instances have a discretionary power. In times such as the present we ought to place some confidence in the government, particularly in cases where the letter of the law could not with so much advantage be enforced.&#x2014;The hon. gent, concluded with stating, that in his opinion such courts martial as the bill alluded to, should not consist of more than thirteen, nor of less than seven, and that none under age should be admitted to sit in those courts.", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-wilberforce-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

If he were to state his objection to courts of this description, he would say that they were not so competent as others. But this objection referred entirely to that degree of judgment which men of such habits and pursuits were likely to exercise. The great143criterion to be sought for in courts, to which either the lives, the properties, or the privileges of men were to be tried, was judgment. But the hon. gentleman had not founded any of his reasons of amendment upon this broad and ostensible principle. He had objected to the general constitution of courts martial on the score of sympathy. It was not probable that any of those gentlemen composing a court martial would ever be reduced to the melancholy circumstances of those brought before them for trial. If this objection on the score of sympathy and feeling had any weight, it would militate equally against all courts martial. Did not courts martial try private soldiers as well as their brother officers, and would the hon. gent, say that officers could have that sort of sympathy with private soldiers which he was disposed to derive from an idea of a probability of being involved in similar circumstances? The truth was, that here there was no such sympathy as the hon. gent, pleaded for; and would he or any other gentleman say that that house ought to be more tender of the lives of rebels in Ireland, than of the lives of private soldiers who formed the strength and defence of the country? and yet the hon. gentleman's motion went to shew that where we neglected the interests of the private soldier, we should be anxious to provide for the safety of rebellion. But the hon. gent, was apprehensive of the rashness and undiscriminating judgment of such officers as were under age. For his own part if any want of feeling was to be apprehended, it was not, he thought, from young men warm with all the feelings, and all the sympathies of youth. If any such danger was to be apprehended, it was from men rather grown old in the prejudices and passions of a party; it was from men who had grown callus by long habits of severity. The tight hon. gentleman concluded by saying, that in regard to the principle or necessity of the bill, he was not at present called upon to give his opinion. He could not say it was necessary, and he was not prepared to say that it was unnecessary. But at all events if the bill was necessary, the amendment went in a great measure to defeat its object, and was besides founded on a principle that militated against courts martial of every description.", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-windham-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

He did not see why the same regulation should not hold in the present instance, nor why the courts should not consist of the same number of officers as in all other parts of his Majesty's dominions, except two places, where circumstances did not permit it. The number of troops in Ireland afforded every facility, and it was the more necessary to have this tribunal liberally constituted, as it took the individuals out of the cognizance of the other courts.

He should not take up the time of the House, by entering into an inquiry whether the measure were necessary or not? but he would contend, that from the information which his Majesty's ministers had thought proper to give, no inference could be drawn of the existence of that necessity. When his right hon. friend (Mr. Windham), on the first introduction of the measure, had applied for a short delay, in, order that information might be laid before the House, his application had been rejected on the ground that the smallest delay would be dangerous in the then existing circumstances. Though he was not in the House himself on that occasion, he was at the time fully sensible of the justice of the application, but whatever argument might have applied in that instance against delay, there could be none to apply in the present. The two bills now in their stages through the House, would not expire till six weeks after the commencement of the present session. The session had commenced on the 22d of November, and the bills would of course not expire till the 1st or 2d of January. He therefore put it to the House, what possible argument could be used against a short delay, until such information should be communicated to the House, either by the report of an open or secret committee, us should justify the adoption of such strong measures. It had been more than once his lot to complain of the conduct of his Majesty's ministers, in bringing forward measures of great importance, without laying sufficient information before the House; and he took this opportunity of protesting against die manner in which the two bills before the House had been introduced. There was another circumstance too that should weigh with parliament, and147which materially affected the spirit of the constitution: he meant the operation of such a course of proceeding in the legislative union. Since the passing of that measure, it had become more than ever the duty of his Majesty's ministers to shew to the people of Ireland, that every measure involving their interests, not only claimed but received us much discussion and attention as it would, it their own legislature still continued to assemble. It was particularly their duty to avoid giving the slightest ground of suspicion, or suffering any one to fancy that the affairs of that country were not fully attended to. He did not mean to oppose die completion of the two bills before the House, though, if he were to follow the example of other gentlemen, in stating the ground of his private opinion, he should feel embarrassed, and considerable difficulty in making up ids mind on the subject. The Mouse had no documents to ascertain whether the measure were the wisest or most proper for Ireland; they bad no official information whether the situation of that country was such as to require coercive measures; they had no ground on which to rest their proceedings, but the language of his Majesty's ministers, that language generally varying, and always changing. He meant nothing ungracious to his Majesty's ministers individually, but, as a member of Parliament, he was bound to speak his sentiments openly, and say, he could have no confidence in their administration, neither in the wisdom of their measures, nor in the activity with which they executed them. The hon. gentleman entered here into a train of severe comments on the conduct of ministers, and on their incapacity. He then adverted to the manner in which the notice of his hon. friend (Admiral Berkeley) had been so quickly commented on by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. He had expected that his hon. friend's observations would have met with a very different reception. That challenge which ministers had on a former day given when they deprecated a discussion by a side wind, they now had an opportunity of deciding by the proposition of the hon. Admiral respecting his hon. relation; and tile more the House investigated the conduct of ministers, the more fully would they discharge their duty.", "author_id": "/people/mr-thomas-grenville", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

{"date": ["1803", "dec", "09"], "content": "began by adverting to the manner in which the business had been opened by the hon. Secretary, which, he said, though very proper at any ordinary time, and though possibly very proper then, was so different from the view which he felt himself compelled to take of the subject, that his observation, he feared, would appear very little to arise out of the statements which the House had just heard. His view of the subject went to the general de-163fence of the country both present and to come. Under that notion, the difficulty was to know where to begin, or how to confine the discussion within such bounds as he should wish to prescribe to it. It was impossible, in the course of such an inquiry, not to bring forward many points that must bear hard upon the hon. gent. opposite. He could not arraign the measures of the time without arraigning the conduct of those, by whom these measures were planned; nor could he suffer his mind to be so engrossed and absorbed, as seemed to be the case with many, by the mere business of defence, as to lose ail thought about the conduct and character of those to whom the national affairs were entrusted. This, though in some respects a secondary consideration, inasmuch as it must be founded on proofs to be derived from an examination of their conduct, was, nevertheless, a very important and necessary one, was connected with every part of the subject, and might serve, perhaps, as well as any that could be chosen, to present the subject in that point of view, in which it was most important to consider it. His own general opinion on this head, he could not better describe, than in some lines which gentlemen might have seen on Inn windows and shutters, where the writer, speaking of the faults of men and women, and allowing that many faults belong to men, concludes, most injuriously and ungallantly,Poor women have but two;There's nothing good they say, and nothing right they do.These lines, however bad the poetry, and however false the sentiment, in its original application, were, he was sorry to say, perfectly descriptive of his opinion of his Majesty's present ministers. That he might not seem to say this at random, without foundation or proof, he would beg only to take a short view of their conduct, as applicable to the actual stale of things. If he were to proceed strictly in this inquiry, though by no means unjustly, he should take up their conduct from the moment of the Treaty of Amiens. It was from that period, according to the opinion of many at the time, according to their own opinion, as declared since, that measures of precaution and defence ought to have, begun. They who had declared, that from the moment of the signature of that treaty, the conduct of the enemy was a continued series ofviolence, insult,andaggression;they whose partisans had told us, that he must be 'nature's fool,' and not the hon. gentleman's, who could ever believe in the durability of that treaty;164theycertainly could refuse to accept the Treaty of Amiens, as the period from which the defence of the country ought to have been a subject never absent from their minds. But as he did not wish to deal hardly with the hon. gentlemen, as it would be mean and niggardly to be sparing of concessions where the materials of charge existed in such abundance, he would be content to date his examination from a much more recent period, and to leave out all the intervening space between the Treaty of Amiens, and the Bill of March, the day on which his Majesty's message was brought to Parliament. He would suppose it to have been perfectly right, that from the moment peace was made, no matter with what circumstances, you were to proceed according to the established rule in such eases, were to reduce your army, dismantle your fleet, dispose of all your stock and implements of war, sell off gun-boats for little more than the value of the old iron, refuse for five guineas men whom you would be happy now to get back for fifty; discharge others, whom you could not get back at all. All this he would conclude to be right, and that, without the observance of these accustomed forms, ministers would never have been able to persuade the country, or to satisfy themselves, that the peace which they had made was a real peace, and not a mere make-believe. He would consider their conduct only during the period subsequent to the 8th of Mach. The establishments of the country were then happily brought to the standard at which it was proposed they should remain; all the reductions had been completed; no subsequent alteration had taken place; a vote in parliament might have passed, but nothing more: all the means of defence were as much to be re-collected as if the country had never been at war. Giving ministers full credit for the completely defenceless state in which the country then was, he would proceed to consider, what the change was which they had since effected, and what the means which they had possessed for that purpose; so that by a comparison of the means possessed, and the work done, a judgment might be formed-as to the degree of blame or merit ascribable to their conduct. And here he would wish to adopt a method, such as was often employed on other subjects, where, when thequantumof objects could not be ascertained with exactness, means were resorted to for assigning at least amaximumorminimum?He had heard, where in the case of exorbitant election charges, in a bill for cockades165for instance, the candidate had offered to pay for all the ribands that could be proved to have been in the shop for the last six months; or where the charge was for liquor, instead of attempting to calculate the number of drinkers, and the average quantity they might severally have drank, he had proposed not only to pay for all that had been in the cellar within a certain time, butto gauge the House,and to give credit for all that could have been contained in it, supposing it to have been one entire cistern of liquor from the cellar to the garret. He would pursue a course somewhat similar in estimating the merit of the exertions of the hon. gentlemen. Instead of saying 'so much ought to have been done in recruiting, so much in completing the militia, so much in procuring defence in other ways,' he would rather beg the House to take a general view of the means possessed by the country, of the manner in which ministers had the dispasal of these means, of the time they have had to employ them, and comparing the whole with the result, to determine in their own minds, whether the affairs of the country, in this most critical concern of its defence, had or had not been placed in proper hands. Let the several heads of comparison, as he had enumerated them, be considered more in detail. The means of the country, in its first and greatest article, the basis of all the rest, was a population of fifteen millions: the time, as he had agreed to take it, from the 8th of March, was nine months, three quarters of a year. The wealth of the country was, he must confidently say, for this purpose unlimited. There was nothing that the country was not willing to do in the way of personal service, or to contribute in the way of money. It was long, indeed, before the hon. gent. thought fit to call upon them. Whether it was that they feared 10 alarm the holders of omnium, according to their own original account, or whether they distrusted the zeal of the country, according to the explanation given of their intentions, in their second edition, when they had had the assistance of a learned commentator (Mr. Sheridan); whichever of these was the case with respect to them, the result of the fact was, that the country was no sooner told of its danger, and summoned to rouse in its defence, than it obeyed the call with an alacrity which the hon. gentlemen have since confessed themselves to have been unprepared for. 'They did not call spirits from the vasty deep,' which refused to answer to their bidding. On the contrary, the hon. gent. had no166sooner began totryfor this zeal, had hardly begun to sink this well, before the national feeling rose so fast upon them, that they found themselves in danger of being over whelmed by it, and begged for God's sake to be pulled up again. They no sooner turned this cock than it spurted in their faces. They had nothing to plead, therefore, on the score, that the country did not second their efforts, that it withheld its assistance, that it kept back its milk, as it were: the country was ready to yield its resources to any amount for which they would have declared it necessary to call for them. So far as to the means which theypossessed:but were the meansemployedinconsiderable, or not abundantly sufficient to prove the improvident management of those who had the administration of them? I he money expended for the army of reserve alone, and that too in mere bounties, could not be estimated at less than,&#x00A3;l,000,000. For the volunteers, the hon. gent, had just said, that the estimate for the ensuing year must be,&#x00A3;700,000; and, therefore, for the year now closed, in which, if some articles were less, others were considerably greater, could not, he conceived, be less than &#x00A3;1,000,000. This, as the sum advanced by government to that object; to which, if he was to add, as undoubtedly he must add, the part contributed by individuals, he certainly should be within the mark, when he stated the whole expense incurred for volunteers at not less than &#x00A3;2,000,000. Here then was a sum of at least &#x00A3;3,000,000 expended in little more than the merecreationof a force; and that in a way, for the greater part of it, infinitely more oppressive than if raised by a general tax. What then, they were to ask, was the forcecreated?And upon this occasion the statement of the hon. gent, had something very grand and imposing, perfectly in the stile of many statements, which were heard in that House. The safety of the country was provided for, it might be said, by a vast mass of armed force amounting to not less than 500,000 men. He was tar from sure that the numbers might not even exceed these limits. But, of course, it was not to be supposed, that they were to take this statement merely as it stood in words, without inquiring a little, what this mass this fabrick consisted of: how much of it was of solid masonry, part of the whole standing force of the country; how much was of a later date and less regular construction; how much might be composed of materials still more recently collected, and more hastily put together, and be liable, in consequence, to various cracks167and settlements; and what portion of it was mere lath and plaster, not distinguishable, perhaps, by the eye, and seeming to be a continuation of the same front, but no more the same with it, in reality, than one of the new temporary barracks, of which they might expect to hear so much soon, was to be considered as a building of the same sort with St. Paul's or Westminster Abbey. It would be found, upon examination, and when this great building came to be regularly surveyed, that a very small part indeed; was regular army; that a large portion of it was militia; that another less considerable part was army of reserve; but that three-fourths of the whole was the more levy in mass, moulded into the form, and known under the title, of volunteer corps. This is not what would have been understood, at least without explanation, in a report of the force of France, or Austria, or Prussia, or any other military power. Of the two first descriptions of force here enumerated, it was not necessary to say much. The regular army was what they had always known the regular army to be, and never more, than during the whole of the period of the late war. The militia had long been Wrought to a high degree of excellence, and was at that time, perhaps, in as great perfection as it was possible for troops to attain, of whom neither officers nor men could have had the benefit of actual service. Of the army of reserve the character must be for some time continually changing, according to their progress in training, and according to the manner in which the men were disposed of, either as selected, and incorporated into old battalions; making however, a very incommodious mixture of men serving upon different tenures; or as put together in battalions by themselves. But in neither way could they be considered, for some time at least, as fit to be classed with the regular troops; nor would it be possible at any time for those so to class them, who refused to admit to the description of a soldier, any man whose engagement of service did not extend to term of life. It would be curious indeed, if those who resisted most pertinaciously, and at the hazard even of having no army, every attempt to change the service of the line from life to term of years, should now find out that soldiers serving both for term of years, and for service within the realm only, were entitled to reckon as part of the regular army. Cut a great portion of these were, for the present, good for no service either without or within the realm. They were men newly collected168together with their pockets full of money, or who had only emptied them by a continued course of intoxication, and had not yet got their grass flesh off, had not got the beer out of their bellies, which they had been swilling for weeks, many of them at the rate of o guineas a man. As for those who were left behind in what were called the reserved battalions, they, for the most part, were so left behind and reserved, because no one thought it worth his while to take them, and were of a sort which no time or drilling could ever render serviceable; time indeed, being with many of them the last thing they wanted, as the very objection to be urged was, that they were already past the age of service. The last and most important, certainly the most extensive head of force, was that which Comprised the great body of inhabitants to whom arms had been given or promised, the general collection of the volunteer corps. In speaking of these bodies, it was as well perhaps to attempt, though he knew the attempt must be vain, to obviate the misrepresentation, which he was aware, was lying in wait to seize upon every word he should say,(Hush'd in grim repose expects his evening prey,)by observing, that what he had to condemn in these institutions was not the individuals, but the system. That in speaking of a body of 400,000 men, he certainly did not mean to say that they were all useless, or worthless, or of a character he knew not what, that was to make them run away at the sight of an enemy. He certainly should not be inclined to say this of any 400,000 men, taken at random from among the inhabitants of this country, and must necessarily be less inclined to say so, of a body which from the manner of its being combined, must contain a greater proportion of the zeal, spirit, and patriotism of the country, than any other of equal numbers taken without rule or selection. To impute therefore to any one a purpose of censuring the volunteers individually, was too childish to be deserving of notice. As little could he intend to say, that the body of volunteers, as at present constituted, were of no use: 400,000 men with arms in their hands, and consisting for the most part of persons within certain ages, could not be so combined, as not to be capable of being useful. All that he meant to say was, that these corps must be for ever unsuited to the sort of service on which it was intended to employ them; and that the methods pursued with them were calculated to render169them as little useful as it was possible for such an assemblage of men to be. The idea was, as had been long foreseen, and long deprecated, to combine these into companies, regiments, and brigades, and to endeavour to make regular soldiers of them. He was of opinion that you never could make regular soldiers of them; and that the attempt to do so was founded in every respect upon false views, both of the nature of those corps and of the military service in general. He grounded this opinion upon circumstances, certainly having nothing injurious in them to the characters of persons acting in volunteer corps. It was no reproach to any one, that he was of an age, or size, or state of health, that did not admit of his performing the duties of a soldier: that he was the father of a family, and could not be spared from the care and superintendance of those who looked to him at every moment as their protector and guide: that he was engaged in a business which he could not leave without ruin, and without ruin to those who depended on him for their support. There was no reproach in all this; but there was a great deal in it, which must prevent corps, consisting for the most part of men so circumstanced, from either performing for any length of time the duties of soldiers employed on service, or from acquiring the expertness and habits by which those duties must be performed. These were truths which would not probably, be much disputed. All the world would agree, that to talk of giving to citizens and householders, ('to resident inhabitants paying scot and lot') to men engaged in professions and callings, who were compelled to live on one spot, were tied down by the care of families, who rejected military controul, were serving without pay, were officered in a great measure by persons of their own description if not of their own choosing,&#x2014;that to talk of giving to such men the character and qualities of regular soldiers, was the greatest of all absurdities. Yet this which every one would agree in, which no one would be hardy enough to deny, was the utmost that had ever been said, in disparagement, as it was called, of the volunteers. All the rest was a mere military question, by which the volunteers were not at all affected. Once admit that collections of men such as he had just described, were not capable of being formed into regular regiments, that is to say, regiments possessing the properties which were looked for in troops of the line, and it then became a question, to be decided on general military principles, and in which the volunteers were170no longer concerned, how far corps of a certain acknowledged inferiority ought to be employed in certain services, or to be placed in certain situations. And here a great mistake seemed to prevail of supposing, that whatever possessed in itself a certain degree of force or strength, must by its addition to any thing of the same description, produce a degree of force more than would be found in either of the parts separately: that strength added to strength would always produce strength. But this was evidently not so. If the addition supposed was not judiciously made, weakness, instead of strength, might be the consequence. No one could doubt that a regiment of four or five hundred men, volunteers or others, must possess some power of annoying an enemy. But was it sure that your line would be strengthened, and your general power of annoying and de-defeating the enemy be increased by such addition? He would take an example from a profession with which the House and he were, in general, probably less acquainted than they were even with military affairs, but which might happen to be more familiar to them in this particular view. What was the reason that in naval actions, frigates and even fifty gun ships were not suffered to make part of the line? Was it, that fifty gun ships or even frigates were of no force? That their balls did not hit hard? That some of (heir guns were not even heavier than a part of those which formed the battery of a ship of the line? By no means. It was, he must conclude, because a line of battle at sea was a species of machine, so constructed, as to require a certain proportionate strength in all its parts, the failure of any one of which would draw after it the failure of all the rest. The same was the case with an army.Therealso was a line, and which, as might be collected from the very expression of 'regiments of the line,' could be formed only of troops trained to a certain degree of discipline and regularity. To form it otherwise, to put into the line corps which, from want of experience or instruction, might not maintain the part of the action allotted to them, would not only be to endanger the whole by that particular failure, but might in a thousand other ways, embarrass the operations of an army, and defeat the plans of a commander. Man&#x0153;uvres must be calculated upon supposed qualifications in the troops and officers, who are to execute them. What must be the situation of a general, if when directing the execution of any pressing service&#x2014;a hill, suppose, to be occupied, a post to be main-171tained, a wood to be defended, a redoubt to be stormed&#x2014;in a crisis which left no leisure or deliberation or inquiry he must be comparing the characters of the different corps under his command, and be exposed, at last, to the uncertainties of troops, whose composition was unknown, whose conduct in a days of action was to be tried for the first time, and who, in the mode of service now proposed for them, might involve in their defeat or miscarriage, the discomfiture of the whole army. These were not objections to volunteers in general: so far from it, that he, on the contrary, had always contended for them, to a far greater extent, though on a far less expensive footing than that on which they were now established. His objections went only to volunteers, moulded into the forms, and destined for the sort of service which government had now assigned them. It was government which had given them this most false direction; which by dressing them in red coats had betrayed, at once, the character in which they meant to consider them, and the use they meant to put them to,&#x2014;a use for which they could never be made fit. This was the point on which he wished to insist. Ocher objections to the present system he should not no v dwell upon; nor consider what might be the future danger arising to the state from bodies of armed men, subject to no regular authority, governed by committees and sub-committees, and having more the character of debating societies than of schools of military discipline. He was considering them merely as part of the defence of the country against a foreign enemy, and in this view he must recall to the attention of the House: first, the immense reduction to be made in our force, when, out offiveorsixhundred thousand,fourwere understood not to be soldiers, but only armed inhabitants; and next, when these armed inhabitants were prepared and fashioned in a manner so little judicious, as in the plan now pursued. When to this was added, that by the exemptions given, contrary to the intentions of ministry, and by the mere effect of haste and oversight, numbers had latterly flocked into these corps, as a refuge from other service, and that so large a portion of the active population of the country was thereby-locked up, and withdrawn from the service either of the army of reserve or militia, (the regular recruiting was out of the question); he would leave to the House to judge what credit was to ho given to the hon. gentlemen on this head of the account. The172whole return, the whole force produced by the hon. gentlemen, after three millions expended, and with the command of an unlimited credit, was 1st. 400,000 volunteers, such as he had described, and whose formation operated, as he had described, in respect to the other services; 2dly, a militia, excellent in its kind, but incomplete, and rendered more difficult to be completed by the effect of the measure above referred to; 3dly, twenty, or six and twenty thousand army of reserve; and 4thly and lastly, an addition, (as he should have said) of 5,00O, or (as he now understood from the hon. gentlemen) of 7,000 men to the regular army! This was all that the hon. gentlemen had produced at the end of nine months, and as the fruit of all their labour and travail. This was all that the nation had got, in return for its large contributions, its ready sacrifices, its heavy expense, both of patience and money, five thousand men to the regular army, five pints of reasonably good soup, was the whole that these state-cooks had been able to produce after all their simmerings and boilings, all the hams and chickens, and pounds of beef, which they had melted down, and the bills which they had run up in consequence at the different shops.&#x2014;Thus far he had gene in considering what a great philosopher of old would have called thelivinginstruments of our defence. Theinanimateinstruments must not be overlooked, though he should say but little to all the objects which that class would comprize, such as works, fortresses, preparations by sea and land, every thing that wisdom and foresight could provide or could arrange, towards making the approach of an enemy difficult, or giving force and efficacy to the action of those who were preparing to resist him. In all this he feared a dreadful deficiency. Much as might be wanting in living means, the want of judgment and ability in the application of those means, the want of a presiding mind either to create resources, or to turn to account those already existing, he feared was not less considerable. He would not attempt to enter into a criticism either upon the general distribution of the forces, which so far as it was built upon a system of concentration, or of collecting the force into great masses for the protection of vital parts, he certainly approved, nor would he offer any opinion as to the considerable works going on at Chelmsford and Chatham, having in fact, no opinion to offer. He would touch upon one point only of that sort, and that not so much with a view of stating what he thought173ought to be done, as of remarking on whatwasdone, and upon the dreadful weakness and inconclusiveness of many of those reasonings, which governed the conduct of the country, in points where its very existence was at stake. From the northernmost point on the coast of Suffolk, where the protection might be supposed to cease from the shipping at Yarmouth, to a part of the coast of Essex, where a naval defence of another kind might be supposed to begin; (and where he hoped it had at length begun, though, very late in the year it certainly had not made its appearance), there was a line of coast accessible in most weathers, and certainly very commodious for the landing of an enemy in such vessels as those in which they were expected to come. Upon this line he should unquestionably, think it highly advantageous if a defence were provided, formed by the construction of what were known to our officers under the name of Martello Towers, a species of edifice so called from a memorable instance of one at Martello in Corsica; where by s tower of this sort, garrisoned by some ten or half dozen men, and mounted with about two guns, a ship of the line of ours and a frigate, were, during the last war, completely foiled and driven off, though they were able to approach within a quarter of a mile of the object, and though the captain, a most approved officer, would not withdraw from the contest while there was a hope left, nor till he had lost an immense number of his men, and had had his ship twice set on fire. No one would pretend to say, that towers of this sort would not produce a great effect upon an enemy, whoever he might be, that came within the reach of their guns. That they would stop the disembarkation of infantry, he was not prepared to say. On the contrary, he was of opinion that they would not. Great as the loss might be, the enemy, if determined, would still accomplish his object. But would the same be the case with artillery and horses? And would not the slaughter be immense, and the delay most important, were it possible that under such a file a disembarkation of that sort could after all take place? The objection, therefore, to such defences must resolve itself into the consideration of expense, or into that of the force which it would lock up, and the means which would be furnished to the enemy, should the fortresses in question finally fail into his hands. As to the latter objection, he had clearly stated, what the contents of such towers were, and what the loss would be to those from whom they should be taken, viz. a dozen men at the utmost, and a cou-174ple of guns. The value to the enemy would be none; for the guns would never be transportable; and, certainly not the towers; and neither would be of any use to him where they were. But their uselessness to the enemy it was unnecessary to prove, as it was hardly possible that they should fall into his hands. It was of the nature of these small fortresses (quite the reverse of what was the case with redoubts) that they were equally impregnable to cannon and to musquetry, and could not be taken but by such means as the enemy would neither have time nor inclination to employ. The whole question, therefore, was a question of expense: and what would that expense be, incurred once for all, compared with the maintenance of such a living force, (supposing even that we had the force, and could spare it for that purpose,) as would give to any tract of coast the same security which would be derived from the defence in question? Considering the simplicity of the construction of these towers, the little interior fitting they would require, the rude materials of which they might be composed, (the stones made use of for paving London, might serve for the most expensive part,) the facility with which materials would be conveyed for buildings necessarily situated on the edge of the coast, and in its most accessible parts, it is difficult to conceive, that 1000l. a piece must not be an ample allowance. And thus for a sum of 3O.00Ol., and with a force of 300 men, thirty miles of coast, in parts the most vulnerable, would be put in a state of security far greater at least than any which they could enjoy without the aid of such precautionary measures. But let the House consider what happened without this. To supply the place of these despised towers, the coast was lined with sea fencibles, armed with pikes, a weapon which had been said, if he recollected right, in some of the circular official papers, to be capable of great effect in the hands of a Briton, fighting for every thing that was dear to him. He wished the House to reflect, what would be the situation of these pikemen, at Aldbo-rough for instance, one of the places, where there was a corps of that sort, and which was situated on the part of the coast to which he had been alluding. Here was a straight shore with deep water, and a beach, on which in moderate weather vessels might run with confidence, without even shortening sail: and in these circumstances it was supposed, that when vessels should thus arrive, containing each a hundred soldiers, and carrying a four-and-twenty pounder on its bow, men were to stand on the shore with their pikes,175and push them off! Was this the idea of a bold Briton? or was it the idea of master Fribble? \"Begone, fellow,\" You might as well suppose, that the enemy was to be kept off by bodkins or knitting-needles. It was certainly not by a force of this sort, that the coast could be defended. The great argument, indeed, was, that it could not be defended at all, and that therefore no defence should be attempted. And here he wished to recall the attention of the House to that sort of loose, vague, inconsiderate style of reasoning, to which he had before alluded, and to which, it was melancholy to think, the very life and being of the state was sometimes entrusted. When a proposal was made, for securing a part of the coast by works, as happened in the case of an hon. friend behind him (Colonel Cranford) the answer universally made was, that you could not fortifyeverypart of the coast; and thence it was meant to be inferred, that it was useless to fortifyany.But what was the sort of reasoning that could lead to this as a conclusion? In many cases, he was ready to allow, that an argument to that effect would be just. If the question was of shutting mice out of a pantry, the conclusion would be correct, that to stop up one hole was useless, while any other was suffered to remain open. The strength of a chain, according to an old observation, was the strength of the weakest link. To fortify those above it was useless: to add to the strength of those below it might be injurious, as well as useless; because, without adding to the general strength, you might add something to the weight. But were any one to apply that same reasoning to a chain in a figurative sense, to a chain of posts, nothing could be more false and inconclusive. It is not here as in the other case, that the force applied acted through every part. The force acted only on the part to which it was applied; and if that part happened to be the strongest, would be resisted with the power of the strongest. It was true, that if the enemy knew your weak point, and could be sure of carrying his attack there, all that he was arguing against, must be admitted. But would any one maintain, that such was the fact? Was this, what they heard on other occasions? When the danger of invasion was in discussion, how were those laughed to scorn, who seemed to reason upon the idea, that the enemy, once embarked, could say either where he should, or where he should not, touch the land? How much of our confidence was founded, and justly founded, on the uncertainty which belongs to all the enemy's operations, and in the impossibility of his fixing with certainty176the point in which his descent must be made? Yet here the tables were suddenly turned and to attempt to secure any part of the coast, while another was left unguarded, was treated as trifling and childish; because the enemy would be sure to chuse what was weakest, and must be able to guide his armament with perfect precision to the part, whatever it was, that he should chase. He urged this topic, with a view to expose the sort of reasoning, which was admitted often into concerns of the greatest importance, and might prevail possibly at the present moment in questions more critical and more certain, than that which he had brought forward respecting the coast of Suffolk. There was, in fact, no security any where with persons so wholly unsuited, to the arduous crisis in which they had to act, as the hon. gentlemen. In every part of their system little considerations were mixing themselves with great, so as to spoil the effect of the whole, and prevent its working truly in any of its operations. This was eminently the case in the pecuniary part, where a wild profusion was so combined with a mean parsimony, that it was like the conduct of a man, who in giving a great entertainment with all the dainties of the season, peas at a guinea a quart, should disgrace the whole by a scarcity of clean glasses, or by a coarse and ill-washed tablecloth. With this must be coupled, as it possibly arose out of it, an extraordinary passion for machinery, into which the hon. gents, had been led, partly, as it appeared, by the hope of working cheaper, and partly by that common error, of supposing that, a great machine must be calculated to produce a great effect. Their machines were much like that which Hogarth represents, where the wedge, the lever, the axisin paritrochio,all the mechanical powers were introduced for the purpose of drawing a cork, an operation which a waiter or butler would perform more effectually, as well as more expeditiously, by a little instrument from his pocket called a cork-screw. It was of the nature of all machinery, that in proportion as the parts were complicated, the movement was likely to be slow; not to mention that if any part should happen to be misplaced, or wanting, or ill-adjusted, the whole must be at a stand. This was very much the case with some of the machines of the hon. gentlemen. In order to keep their expenses out of sight, and to throw as much as possible upon individuals without the intervention of Parliament, they had set up their grand system of lord lieutenants, deputy lieutenants, lieutenants of division, inspectors of divisions, superintendants of parishes, &c.; &c.; persons very proper to be appointed, and177to be held in readiness, but very improper for much of the work on which they wore employed, namely, that of getting the country into a state of military defence. Of all the instruments to work with for such a purpose, the worst, surely, that could be devised, was that of a deputy lieutenant's meeting. Every one had heard, frequently, and almost proverbially, of the slow progress of official business. But at what rate must that business proceed, which had for its office a canary? Which, instead of clerks with salaries, amenable to superiors, compellable to a certain attendance, acted by country gentlemen, subject to no authority, who were bound by no especial duty, who might attend as much or as little as they liked, and who might feel possibly that they conferred a favour every time that they attended at all? Offices, too, in which government business was transacted, were open commonly every day, and for many hours each day. But what must be the condition or that office, whose days of attendance were one in a week, and whose office-hours were about three in each of those days? This office was likewise acorrespondingoffice: but what must be the activity of that correspondence, where between the letter and its answer there must be an interval always of a week? He took no notice here of the manner in which at such meetings business must necessarily be conducted, where few possibly had given much attention to the object in question, where no one had any right to prescribe to the rest, where many would come more to talk of their own private business or to meet those they were in quest of, than to promote the object in question, where most were impatient to be gone, where all had voices, and, what was possibly not the least evil, where every one had a right to declare that voice at as great length as he thought proper He would not better illustrate the effects of the system which had thrown business into this course, than by stating what had happened upon the subject of signals. It might have been thought, that the arranging a system of signals, as it must have been among the earliest and most pressing objects of attention, that which, in some sort, was to give effect to every thing else, was the one also which would have been most easily accomplished, and most speedily carried into effect. The mode that had been adopted, was, too, of the most simple kind. A line of stations was f6 be established along the coast, placed under the direction of persons appointed by the Admiralty, and qualified to collect and to convey, by means of the Admiralty sig-178nals, such more detailed intelligence as was necessary for officers appearing off the coast, or commanding at the naval stations; while from this, as from a circumference, other lines were drawn inland, for the mere purpose of giving alarm, or for communicating a few of the more simple results of what had been observed upon the coast. Any one would suppose that this was a work, which would not take long in completing; considering that it was of that sort, which might be going on in ail places at once, so that the time necessary for the whole would be no more than what had been required for the latest of the parts; and that in three weeks or a month from the first alarm, that is, from the 8th of March, however much our means of resistance might have been wanting, we should at least not have been liable to see the enemy amongst us without notice of his approach. And so it would have been with any set of persons, who would have done things in a plain way: who would have been content \"to draw a cork with a corkscrew.\" But not so, the savers of money, and the lovers of machinery. By seeking to divide the expense of these signals with the counties, and throwing the business, in consequence, into the train which he had described, the result was (the House would hear it with astonishment) that in some of the maritime counties, immediately exposed to the enemy, and where the attack was most expected, the system of signals, even in those parts of it, which were most essential, and on which the whole depended, was not completed to that very hour. It would naturally be inquired, how this could happen and the explanation might be given, by stating only what had taken place in the county to which he belonged. When the deputy-lieutenants signified to the lieutenant of division, that stations must be prepared for the reception of the naval officers: the lieutenant of division did not care to stir in the business, till he knew whether the sums which ho should advance, would be repaid to him by the deputy lieutenants. The deputy lieutenants on the other hand, were a little shy of engaging for this money, till they should know, whether they could make it good from the county: and, on the part of the county, it was quickly replied, that the lieutenants would look in vain for repayment there: for that the sums in question were no article for a county-rate, and in no county-rate should they be admitted. Here the matter hung for some time, and here it might have hung still longer, if the Deputy Lieutenants, weary of this slow return of correspondence, and impatient of further delay179in a matter so important and urgent, had not received to take the risk upon themselves, and to direct the completion of the work, trusting that government would see them finally repaid. This government had engaged to do so; and the county of Norfolk might by that time, perhaps, be in possession of its signals. But by whose fault had it happened, that it was not in possession of them sooner? It must fairly be said, not by the fault of any one. The striking feature of the case was, that with so great a delay and such a succession of persons, no one could be found to whom the delay was imputable. The Lieutenant of Division could not be blamed, for not being willing to advance his money, till he knew by whom he was to be repaid. The Deputy Lieutenants might well have been justified, had they persisted in refusing to the last, to take upon themselves an expense, which they had no means of recovering from the county. The county was well warranted in insisting that their charge was one, which was incurred for the general safety, and which ought to be defrayed by a general tax. The Admiralty were not to blame for delaying to send officers, and commence the expenses of their establishment, till they should know that houses were ready to receive them. But this successive justification of all the parties concerned in the measure, was the most complete condemnation of the system to which it belonged. What must that system of proceedings be, in which, when every party under it had done his dnty, nine months could elapse, before the maritime counties were furnished with their establishment of signals? With this example be might safely close his account of the conduct of the hon. gents, as persons fit to direct the energies, and call out the resources of the country, at the present moment. The instance itself, as a circumstance in the situation of the country, was how of no great importance; as it might be hoped, that by this time, or at least in about a month more, the evil was, or would be, at an end, and the maritime counties be prepared with their signals. But it was not so with the state of the army, and of the military force of the country. Here was not only a great misconduct, but a great national evil and danger, present arid future. The hon. gentlemen had not only not provided an army, but had brought things to a state, in which, without some great change, it was impossible that an army should be provided. The army of reserve, the only channel of recruiting not yet dry, would180soon, possibly, be dry likewise. It had yielded 7000 men: it was doubtful how many more it had to yield. Whatever it gave to the army, was so much in diminution of its own numbers.&#x2014;How much might continue to ooze in from it, in its decreased and decreasing state, was very uncertain; not to mention the dreadful expense and ruinous example of those successive enrolments&#x2014;this double bounty. At all events the supply, in this way, had necessarily a termination. It was an artificial, not a natural cascade. As a supply, it must at last run out. When recruits should have entered from this army, equal to the original numbers, the measure was at an end. The array of reserve, therefore, could not be looked upon as a permanent mode of recruiting and reinforcing the army; and, in the mean while, by this and their other measures, ministers had laid the foundation of such difficulties, as would render it nearly impossible that any such mode should be devised in future. The probability was, that after yielding to the army a few more thousands, so much would just remain of the army of reserve, as would be sufficient to preserve the example of this anomalous force, and to make recruiting impossible by contributing, with the militia, to continue the high rate of bounties. In aid of all these mischiefs came the effect of the volunteer system, which, as the hon. gentlemen had managed it, whether by design or by mistake, locked up 400,000 men of the active population of the country. What a blow was here! He was tempted to call out to the hon. gentleman, as the Roman Emperor did to his General,Redde mihi, Vare, legiones.Seventy thousand men and more, withdrawn from the supply of the army of reserve, by the militia; and 400,000 men withdrawn from both militia and army of reserve by the volunteers; and the army of reserve, the only source for recruiting the army; with what sort of men, and at what rate of recruiting, was the army likely to be supplied? All this, as a future consideration, the hon. gentlemen thought nothing of.&#x2014;They had got, or thought they had got (they had in fact got no such thing), what was sufficient for present defence; and, beyond that, they never thought of looking. Defence was their utmost horizon. All beyond was clouds and darkness. But to those, who did not wish to bound their views merely by that consideration, who thought that if the country was to exist after the present dangers, it was of some consequence to consider what that existence was to be: to such181persons it would be a matter of anxiety to know, how the country was to proceed without the use of a disposable force, and if such a force should appear necessary or desirable, in what manner it was to be obtained. His ideas upon this subject had long since been declared, and he had not been able, by any subsequent reflexion or inquiry, to get beyond the notions which he had at first formed. His opinion had been, and was, that, as a first step, there should be an universal abolition of the system of substitution. That all commutation for personal service (as commutation there must be), should be made by fixed fine, so as lo render government tile only recruiter in the market without competition from militia, army of reserve, or any other service. That to meet, and co-operate with the effects of the advantage thus given, service, in the army, should be changed from life to terra of years; drafting should be formally abolished; means possibly devised to render service in the West-Indies less frequently necessary; and some other subordinate regulations adopted, calculated to give to the profession of a soldier advantages and attractions, additional to those, not inconsiderable ones, which it already had. With these things done, he was of opinion, that the condition of the country was not so changed, either as to the wealth or inclinations of the lower orders of its inhabitants, as to make it impossible, that, upon a greatly increased population, the army should be recruited as in former times. He was by no means sure, that if these methods had been adopted, at the time when they were first suggested (and still more if they had been adopted at a period somewhat earlier) the army would not have been recruited, and the general defence of the country increased, even at this moment, far beyond what it had been by the boasted measure of the army of reserve. That it would be so in the end, there could not be the smallest doubt. In a comparison of these measures, the same distinction must be observed, as gentlemen, accustomed to planting, knew how to make between a sown and a planted tree: though the latter would have the advantage at the beginning, and it might be, for some few years, it was known which would outstrip the other at the long run.&#x2014;But should the danger at any moment be such, as not to wait the gradual progress of recruiting, however successful; or should the general success of recruiting, even in the new circumstances proposed, be less than he was willing to imagine, it would be then open to have recourse to compulsory mea-182sures; but measures so chosen, (that is to say, of which the abolition of substitution should make part), as to become a powerfulstimulusto recruiting, instead of presenting any impediment to it. He was as little a friend to compulsory measures, where they could be avoided, as any other gentleman: but he would not court popularity, nor discredit his own judgement by decrying them as unconstitutional. He had shewn, on a former occasion, together with several of his hon. friends; that so far from objecting factiously to any measure of government, or lying in wait to raise a cry against the hon. gentlemen, he was more ready than the hon. gentlemen had seemed to be, to brave that cry, in support of any measure of the soil alluded to, which the circumstances of the times might render necessary.&#x2014;These were his ideas of the measures to be adopted, for creating that first and most indispensable requisite in the present state of he world, as well for the sake of immediate safety, as with a view to the future condition of the empire,&#x2014;a regular and disposable military force. Instead of this, the hon. gentlemen seemed by their measures to be looking to any other force, rather than that of a regular army, the augmentation to which was as yet, by their own account, only 7OOO men; while by their general conduct they had brought the country to a state, in which, at the end of nine months, a line of cruizers, or (according to the expression of an old poet, whom he did not dare to quote in the original) \"a single plank of wood,\" was all that protected the country, he would not say, from the \"grave,\" but from evils and dangers, of a magnitude not to be described.", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-windham-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1803", "dec", "02"], "content": "rose to make a few observations81in reply. The hon. gent, had said, that in all former cases of the passing of the martial law bill, rebellion actually raged, or tranquillity was very seriously disturbed. He begged leave to set the hon. member right on that head. In the year 1801, this very bill had been not only once but twice renewed in the coarse of the same session, though at that time no rebellion or appearance of rebellion existed from one part of Ireland to another. The hon. gent. seemed to be unacquainted with the history of the rebellion. He did not appear to be aware that the machinations of the disaffected were at their origin carefully veiled in darkness; that their views were gradually disseminated over the country; that it was not till their party was fully organized that they broke out into acts of open rebellion. The wisdom of parliament had been exerted in a number of acts to discover and to disconcert their views. Every effort had been employed to trace out the different relations and bearings of the conspiracy. These efforts had, however, failed of success. Never till the act in question was passed were the designs of rebellion fully ascertained. Never till government was armed with these extraordinary powers was any thing like tranquillity or confidence restored. Though individuals continued to suffer; though acts or insurrection and violence were not altogether destroyed; yet the constitution was saved and the sinews of the rebellion were annihilated. This effect he ascribed, more than to any other cause, to the repeated re-enactments of this bill in the course of the year 1802 and 1803. The hon. gent, however, did not see the necessity of re-enacting the bill at the present period. He had said, that the grounds of its re-enactment formerly was the intimidation of jurors and witnesses in the performance of their duty, but at this moment jurors were unmolested; witnesses could give their testimony without any dread of the consequences; all the ordinary forms of law and of justice were observed. He would not pretend to deny that this description of the state of the country was correct, but he would maintain that the present tranquillity of the country was the effect of the very bill to which the hon. gent, so strongly objected. It was not unknown to the hon. member and the house, that till the bill was passed the system of intimidation was universally prevalent, and the courts of common law were as a matter of necessity shut, not against rebels alone, but against the loyal part of the community, who were82making every sacrifice in support of the constitution and the existing government. It was not till the rebels found that they could not prosecute their schemes with any hopes of success, that the strong powers vested in the government rendered their detection and punishment a matter of almost absolute certainty, that continuance in rebellion was only another term for destruction, that they thought of abandoning their traitorous projects, that they sat down in laborious tranquillity, and began to return to the habits of dutiful allegiance. If the hon. member looked to the state of Ireland, merely as it was at this day, his view would be extremely partial and limited. To be able to reason fairly on the subject, it behoved him to look at the progress and various modifications of the rebellion. He ought to compare the means used to spread disaffection with the means employed to check its diffusion among the lower orders. Among these last means, he had the universal testimony of the best informed persons in Ireland, that this measure had been one of the greatest and efficient causes of the return of tranquillity and order, of the possibility of continuing the ordinary exercise of the form of the common law courts of the land. Independent of this measure, the hon. gent, would not this day have had it in his power to notice the present tranquillity of Ireland as an argument against the re-enactment of the bill. So far from viewing the re-enactment of the bill as any act of severity to the loyal and well-disposed part of the community, he viewed it in the opposite light. By all loyal arid well-disposed individuals, it would be considered as a measure not of oppression, but of protection: not of vigour, but of wise precaution, on the part of the government. It would dispel their apprehensions, and give them new energy in their opposition to the designs of the disaffected. It would enable them to check rebellion at its first opening, and leave to them the privilege of appending for the redress of injuries to the ordinary tribunals of their country. The proclamation of martial law, by the exercise of the prerogative was, what every friend to the constitution would be anxious to avoid. It was to avoid the necessity of such a measure, that the bill was originally introduced, and W3s now proposed to be continued. Without such a bill traitors might escape unpunished, and loyal citizens might be deprived of their constitutional privileges, and dragged before military tribunals. On these grounds the bill had his hearty support, and he hoped it would also obtain the support of the house. It was83a bill which, from his knowledge of the present state of Ireland, he had no difficulty in pronouncing essential to the continuance of tranquillity.", "author_id": "/people/mr-isaac-corry", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

{"date": ["1803", "dec", "09"], "content": "was surprised that his right hon. friend and relation (Mr. Pitt) had thought it was only expedient at this time, to take a prospective view of public affairs; he considered the present as the natural and fit occasion, not only for examining the military arrangements which government proposed prospectively to adopt, but also for examining what use ministers had made of those powers, which, in a former session, were entrusted to them by Parliament. He did not think any thing said by the right hon. gent, opposite to him (Mr. Yorke) such an answer to the objection of his right hon. friend as to have called on him, or any other of those who embraced his sentiments, to make any observations on the present occasion, had it not been from what fell from his right hon. relation (Mr. Pitt). With every wish to agree in any opinion expressed by that right hon. relative, he could not bring his mind to concur in the sentiments which had fallen from him that night. He thought his right hon. friend had taken a contracted view of the subject. No evidence was before the House of the volunteers being at all in a state of becoming effective. How then could it be argued, that they could ever become so completely effective as to prove a substitute for our regular army? It was not, perhaps, common to give an account to the House of the amount of the regular army. It was easy, however, for any gentleman, comparing the statement of the Sec. of State with the other known branches of our military establishment, to know what that force actually was. The whole was stated by the Sec. at War to amount to 120,000. By subtracting the militia we could at once see the amount of our regular force. The militia was 70,000, which being deducted from the whole regular force, as stated by gentlemen themselves, there remained 50,000. In this number, it was necessary to observe, the army of reserve was comprehended. Was it possible, then, to conceive that such was the force of the regular army of this country?&#x2014;But he did not wish to stand on any small ground of objection. It was known pretty well what was the201state of our regular force in March last, at the commencement of hostilities. The inadequate state of our military preparation, he at that time thought a charge of a serious nature against government. But, if it was then regarded as a crime, that the regular force of this country only amounted to 20 or 25,000, what were we to think of the energy or exertion of that government, which, in the space of eight months, during which every nerve ought to have been stretched to render our situation more suitable to the danger which threatened us, had increased that force only from 8 to 10,000 men; and who had, in the mean-time, been compelling every man to enter into a military service of a different nature, to the destruction of that service, which it was their bounden duty to encourage and support. He had heard from his right hon. relation, that doubts were entertained as to the exemption from the army of reserve in favour of volunteers, and he was still more surprised to hear from a right hon. gent, in administration, that such exemption actually existed. He knew that, in the part of the country with which he was best acquainted, the greater part of the volunteers had been enrolled under the express explanation that they were liable to the ballots under the existing acts. It was only represented to them, that as every person must serve, it might be more agreeable to them to serve in their own particular district, or in any particular corps, than to be drafted into the general levy. This exemption was the very cause of the deficiency of the army of reserve; it seemed, therefore, rather remarkable that it should be conferred on persons enrolled under the express understanding that they were not to be entitled to it. Thus were we destroying our regular establishment, and putting the death-blow to that force which had lately gained such laurels to themselves and to their country! While we pretended to be inviting continental alliances, we were depriving ourselves of the means of profiting by them. The army of reserve he could not view as equal to the militia. They were subject to be drafted into other corps, and therefore their officers could never feel that military pride in them which was indispensable in an effective force. The discouragements, too, which the extraordinary bounties given in the army of reserve must have thrown on the recruiting for the regulars, was beyond calculation; and the army of reserve being raised by such immense bounties, must interfere with the recruiting in the regular army; and, besides this, he conceived the army of reserve and those of the regulars to202be a very improper mixture, for this reason, that one man who had received a bounty of 8l. or 10l. and who was bound to go to any part of the world, and to continue in the service for life, would have another by his side who had received 50l. bounty, and who was not bound to go out of this island, nor to continue his services longer than the present war. The one of these would naturally laugh at the other. With regard to the act for regulating volunteers, it was so defective, that many very cruel hardships were fell by volunteers. He stated the case of some volunteers who had exercised sixteen days without arms. The lord lieutenant advised them not to train any more until they had arms; for that otherwise they would lose the benefit of the act, which required that they should have been trained with arms for a part of this time. They accordingly desisted for the four days waiting for arms, but they got none. In the mean-time, they were ballotted in for the militia, and when they claimed their exemption as volunteers, they could not be exempted: thus they lost their exemptions, not by any act of their own, but by the act of government. This shewed the absolute necessity of revising this act. Mr. Grenville concluded by observing, that if government do not take some means to place the regular army of the country upon an effective system, instead of applying themselves to the increase of the volunteer force, much as he respected those corps, yet he must feel the House would not do its duty if it rested contented with a force merely to assist a regular army at home.", "author_id": "/people/mr-thomas-grenville", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1803", "dec", "09"], "content": "&#x2014;I do not rise, Sir, to enter into a discussion of all the points that have this night been touched upon in the course of the debate; they are all, no doubt, of high importance, and deserve a distinct and full consideration. But I shall now abstain, as much as possible, from every210topic that is not necessarily connected with the subject more immediately before the Committee. I shall first, however, make a few observations on the gloomy presages, the melancholy descriptions with which the noble lord who just sat down, has thought proper to conclude his speech. The noble lord has stated, that, in his opinion, the present war is likely to have a lone continuance, and every body knows how much of the wishes and designs of men enter into the composition of their opinions; however, he has argued, as if the expenditure of the country mast be increased, just in proportion to the degree of prosperity which it may at any time enjoy, and, that our prosperity renders it necessary for us to become a military nation; in a word, that the present military arrangements are to be permanent, and that they are to \"grow with our growth and strengthen without strength,\" with all the expense and incumbrances that accompany them. Of this, according to the noble lord, our prosperity is the cause; if so then, our prosperity is productive of a great misfortune; but, I shall not dwell longer on this singular opinion, farther than to say, that it holds out a very afflicting prospect to the country. A right hon. gent. under the gallery (Mr. Piti) has stated, that we should not mix any other consideration with the business of this night, and that we are not to advert to the past, but 10 take care for the future, and vote the supply, without adverting to the use that has been made of former grants for a similar purpose. But I am not of the same opinion with that right hon. gent. that a retrospect of the past does not form as properly the subject for examination on this day, as any speculation upon or provision for the futures indeed, I do not see how the latter is to be justly considered, if we put out of oar view all recollection of the former. If we determine to forget the past we literally determine not to profit; by experience; but, as I said before, shall nut take the right hon. gentleman's advice. The noble lord has reviewed the conduct of his colleague, since the last session, but I shall go farther back. I shall refer to the proceedings of ministers at the time the measures which have been commented upon this evening were proposed, and discussed. The right hon. gentlemen say this night, in reply to the arguments of the right hon. gent, on the same bench with me (Mr, Windham), with which arguments most perfectly concur, that their system was at the period I allude to approved of by Parliament. But even so, is that a fit objection to the disapprobation now expressed of that211system. Since that system originated, the House has had the advantage of experience to judge of its nature and effects, and is that experience in its favour? How shall we form any fair opinion of it but from that experience; and yet the right hon. gent, under the gallery (Mr. Pitt) would, if his opposition to any retrospect were attended to, entirely preclude us from consulting that criterion. In ail points of legislation, it is our obvious duty to consider the mode in which the laws are to be executed; but, in the point which relates to the system now under discussion, this manner of execution is the principal tiling. We have heard that the machinery of this system was bad, and certainly, in my opinion, nothing could be worse, except the views which induced the proposition of it. And shall it then be said, that although the machinery has been found, from universal experience, to be so very exceptionable, the system is still to go on, truly, because Parliament, in the course of last session, approved of it; but the period which bas since elapsed, has proved that it is not calculated to promote the object ministers profess to have in view, namely, the vigorous prosecution of the war. These remarks I mean principally to apply to the system of the volunteers, which forms the most prominent feature in the present debate, and the question with respect to which has been put on very fair grounds by the right hon. gent, on the same bench with me, (Mr. Windham) and with all whose sentiments on the subject I entirely agree. That right hon. gent, stated, that he considered that in the present crisis the defence of the country would be better consulted, and the attack of the enemy better provided for, by the increase of our regular land force, than by the embodying of so many volunteers. He also stated, that the volunteers were rather so many men with-held from our effective force, than so many added to it. He did not, however, say any such thing as that which was ascribed to him by the noble lord, that the regulars were the only army which he would recommend to be raised in the present situation of affairs, but that the description of troops he would propose to be added to the regular army, would be very different from that which the volunteer system had collected. That the patriotic feeling and the martial ardour which the volunteers have manifested entitled them to the highest praise, no man could doubt; but the sentiment of the right hon gent, and mine also is, that this ardour might be much better directed and much better employed in another way. How differently,212however, does this right hon. gent, and the right hon. gent, under the gallery (Mr. Pitt) consider this institution, and the manner in which it may and ought to be used for the public safety. Though the views of both are distinct, yet both agree in thinking the volunteers, according to their present constitution, exceedingly imperfect. The right hon. gent, on the same bench with me does not deny that, even as they now stand, they may be useful, but maintains that a greater degree of utility might be derived from the same men under a different system; that they are not an adequate substitute for the regular army, nor lit to act with them. The right hon. gent, under the gallery considers the volunteers as laying the foundation of a future military association, upon which the country might be able to rely for its defence, in case it should become advisable, in the course of the war, to send all our disposable force out of the country. What men who, according to the letter of the act, are only required to submit to twenty days discipline in the course of the year, in order to exempt them from being ballotted for the militia, and to shelter them from regular service and martial law, to be reckoned upon as likely to become, in any reasonable time, qualified to supply the place of a regular army, and to have the safety of the country committed to their protection! Really I do not fully understand the meaning of the right hon. gent, on this point. It seems to be his view, that the volunteers are hereafter to be converted into something like a disposable regular force. Such a thing is not within the contemplation of the bill upon which the volunteer system is grounded. I certainly do not so understand it; and I am fully sure that the members of the volunteer associations do not by any means so understand it. I should wish to know the sentiments of his Majesty's ministers upon this question. Last session it was understood that the volunteers were to be drilled only on Sundays, in order that the progress of their discipline should not interfere with their respective avocations. This is a collateral circumstance, but is yet material to the point in view; because, if it were the object of the framers of the bill to make the volunteers, within any reasonable time, convertible into an efficient force, they undoubtedly would, as they ought, to have prescribed that much more time should be devoted to the learning of military discipline; in fact, that no time should be lost. But, according to the original principle of the bill, the volunteers were not in any case to go into the army, that is, to enter into213the regular regiments as regular soldiers. I agree with the right hon. gent, under the gallery, that the volunteers should be allowed pay for such days as they are called upon to attend drill, for it would be extremely unfair to admit the idea, that industrious men of family should be expected, from patriotism, to devote so much of their time to military service for the public good, without any pecuniary compensation; although I cannot, comprehend clearly, and where I can comprehend cannot approve, the other remarks he made upon the subject. I should be glad, indeed, to hear in what light those remarks are regarded by ministers, by whom the generality of the observations of the right hon. gent, on the same bench with me (Air. Windbam) seem to be quite misconceived; and I am the more anxious that those observations should be clearly represented, as they happen to be so expressive of the opinions that I myself hold. The right hon. gent. did notsay, as the noble lord stated and argued upon, that the volunteers formed a force that was locked up from the public use; but that many of those who might have composed the necessary increase of the regular army were locked up in the institution; and so they are, by the exemptions which volunteers enjoyed from being ballotted for the militia or the army of reserve. This was the complaint of the right hon. gent, and it is mine Another right hon. gent, on the same bench with me (Mr. T. Grenville) has observed, that no recruits are likely to enter into the army from the volunteer corps. It does not appear to me desirable that such a thing should be sought for. I hope it can never be in the contemplation of any man to use any compulsion for such purpose, towards those who have entered into volunteer corps, under the express understanding which the bill contains. The honour of the country, and the character of the legislature, forbid it. I trust that in no event will an attempt be made to seduce the volunteers to enlist, because such an attempt would be a violation of the terms upon which they became volunteers: and I am pretty sure that no man has entered into those associations, under the idea that he was at any time to be transferred to a regular regiment; and, from the rank in life which she generality of the volunteers hold, any effort to recruit the army from among them would be attended with very inconsiderable success, if any. Indeed, I do not at all like the idea, as it is inconsistent with the nature of the engagements as they understood it upon entering into the volunteer corps. Whatever I may think of the insti-214tution, I wish the members of it to be treated with the utmost respect and attention, as I most sincerely applaud the zeal by which they are actuated; but I can never persuade myself to believe that they are ever likely to answer the expectations of the right hon. gent, under the gallery, even if they were to be drilled 50 days in the year, as the right hon. gent, desired. In what time, I would ask, considering the ordinary habits of the volunteer corps, would they be capable of filling the place which the right hon. gent, would assign them? Certainly not in the next year or the following. Would it be prudent to place the safety of the country under the protection, at any time of war, of a body of volunteers not subject to martial law, nor inured to military discipline? If the rumour of invasion, which, by the by, I never thought so likely to be attempted, and if attempted not so practicable as most people seem to imagine, were to blow over, would the right hon. gent, under the gallery, or any other gentleman, venture to advise the sending of our regular army on any foreign expedition, and depend entirely on the volunteers for our safety against any attack of the enemy on our coast? If in such a case invasion should be actually undertaken, there would, I think, be serious ground for apprehension and alarm. From these considerations I deduce an opinion correspondent to that of the right hon. gent, on the same bench with me, that the machinery of the volunteer system is bad; and that the present system is never likely to produce such a force, even with the aid of that right hon. gentletleman's (Mr. Pitt) utmost ability, as he professes to entertain a hope of. I am persuaded that the volunteers will not answer to act with the regular army in the field of battle, opposed to the enemy's troops, as they are at present constructed, nor to form the ground work of such a force as the right hon. gent, under the gallery has alluded to. I should have no objection to a general armament of the people under any circumstances when the country was in danger. But the volunteers, in the light which I view them, cannot be considered as an arming of the people. If they are to be so considered they are in numbers quite too weak; but if they are to be regarded as the foundation of a future army, as the right hon. gent, under the gallery has hinted, they are too large. For the latter purpose 400,000 men would be too much, and for the former one million of men would not be very considerable. Therefore, in either case, the volunteer system is unsuitable. It struck me, as somewhat strange,215in the noble lord's description of the forces of the country, that he never stated the precise amount of the regular army, as contradistinguished to the militia. Why this was not told, I cannot say; but no doubt it was not, because they were so numerous that they could not be counted. The volunteers seemed to be the favourite subject of the noble lord's description, enumeration, and praise. No doubt the volunteers themselves are justly entitled to applause; but I must say, that the character of the country is not advanced by the frequent repetition of such applause. What, was the House to feel so much elated as if it were matter of wonder that when the country was declared in danger, the people of England were emulous to step forward and defend their homes against a French invader? In such a crisis they had stood forth as was to be expected, and in such numbers that ministers thought proper to resist their increase, and yet they were not likely to afford all the utility of which, other-Wise constituted, they would have been capable; what a melancholy reflection!&#x2014;&#x2014;Among the other objections of the right hon. gent, on the same bench with me, is that which \"e professed to the manner of the Volunteer clothing, an objection of which I also approve; and by those who have commented upon it, I think it has been put on a very wrong footing. I do not like giving men red coats merely to give them the appearance of soldiers, without the material ingredients necessary to form such characters. When I hear ministers talking of the propriety of dressing the volunteers in military uniforms, I ask, do they mean merely that the French troops should take them for soldiers? As masked batteries are used in war, perhaps you mean to fight the French in masquerade? or do you mean to hold out the volunteers as mere targets to be tired at? You might make use of them in various other ways, but you destroy their utility by attempting to make them soldiers. No man will think me apt to favour any system opposite to civil liberty; but yet I cannot help saying, that nothing appears to me more absurd than the idea of making men effective soldiers for the resistance or attack of an effective regular army, without martial law or military discipline. By this project of the volunteers you send men to impede the movements of your regular force, which men might be employed most usefully to annoy the enemy in various ways, to protect the villages, in fact, by other means to defend the invaded against the invader; but the battle in the field with the troops of the invader must be fought by your regular army;216and victory to our arms, in such a contest will, I hope and trust, ever be the result. The prospect of victory to us, indeed, is strengthened by the various advantages which always present themselves to the invaded country. Upon these advantages, independently of the gallantry of our regular troops, I we reckon with just grounds of confidence, if we could look to the active assistance of an armed peasantry; but where are they to be found&#x2014;they are absorbed in the volunteers! What I would wish is, to see all men in their proper places, the soldier in the army, the peasant in the country, and the people throughout in that situation where they could be employed each in his proper department.&#x2014;It may be observed, that it is inconsistent in me, who last year approved of the reduction of the regular army, now to call for its increase; but the times, it is to be recollected, are somewhat different; we were last year at peace, and whether I may be considered \"nature's fool,\" or the Chancellor of the Exchequer's, I certainly did I think that peace would continue; and at the commencement of the war, I stated very fully the reasons why, I thought it might with proper management, and ought to be preserved; but if I was \"nature's fool\" in thinking the peace of Amiens likely to continue, the Chancellor of the Exchequer certainly took a great deal of pains, gave many flattering descriptions, and used all the arguments in his power to confirm me in my folly. Under the influence, therefore, of that folly, I recommended the decrease of our armed force at the commencement of the last sessions.&#x2014;With the hope expressed by the right hon. gent, under the gallery, I heartily join, that we shall not long confine ourselves to mere defensive war; that so soon as circumstances favour the project, we shall proceed upon vigorous offensive war; that we shall not always limit our glory to the mere security of our own country; and that we shall not suffer ourselves, according to the old observation, to \"be swallowed up in the channel.\" But what description of offensive operations does the light hon. gent. deem practicable with the present construction of our armed force? If ever the invasion of Ireland were attempted by the enemy, and that they actually landed a considerable force, would he feel it safe to send any material proportion of our regular army to that country, leaving England to the defence of the Volunteers? I for myself should deprecate any such idea. I beg to be understood distinctly as meaning no disrespect whatever, in what I have observed, to the individuals who compose the Volunteer Corps, who are217deserving, I am confident, of all the regard I feel for their motives. I nevertheless think, that no abilities can possibly turn the Volunteer Corps into a regular army. Now we recommend another mode: augment your regular army. In other cases, when men are compelled to do something in haste, they don't reason like our Ministers. When you want something done in a hurry, you don't set about teaching the whole art or science. If you wanted to take a servant with you abroad, and would teach him a few words of a foreign language, that he might know how to order your supper, or take care of your horses, or enquire his way&#x2014;suppose it was the Latin language&#x2014;would you give him two or three ordinary words, such as bread, beer, &c.; or send him to Eton to learn hispropria qua maribus?Those who know me, know that I have a very great respect for the study of Grammar, and that is certainly the way to make a man a scholar, though not to teach him readily to do a few necessary things. Now, what are you doing? What is the first thing for a soldier? Why to aim and fire. But you are tutoring men into all the punctilios of the parade, making them hold up their bodies and turn out their toes, all proper enough when there is time for it. Remember, that if the Volunteers are wanted in Dec. or Jan. so they were in Aug. or Sept. But, in September, when we were told to expect the French, how many of them had never fired a gun (the case with great numbers of the English peasantry, &c.;) and still fewer knew how to clean it, and to take care of it? That was your case then. But if Ministers were so miserably ill prepared in Aug. last, I confess I am obliged to suspect they now are proportionably so. You have been teaching the Volunteers a variety of matters that some of the best writers on military affairs (Marshal Saxe for example) consider as trifles&#x2014;evolutions which had better be avoided in action. We say the Volunteers compose a main part of our national defence, and that they consist of the greater part of the young and active men. Now I want this description of persons for two other purposes; first for the regular army, and secondly for the armed nation, not for a sort of half army, that you are to put on the top of a hill, to frighten the enemy if he should dare to land. An hon. friend of mine (Mr. Sheridan) at a late public meeting, did me the honour to compliment me as being a private in one of these Corps. No doubt his motive was kind in toasting my name as a private in the Chertsey Corps; but I am obliged to decline the honour he intended me, for this plain218reason, that I never was a private in that Corps; nor will I become one in any Corps, because I will not undertake a situation, the duties of which I am not competent to perform; my age disqualifies me for it; I could not endure the fatigues of a soldier\"s life; though, I must confess, I have seen many gentlemen worse looking than myself, parading in the utmost pomp of military array. It may be said that the influence of example ought to be considered, and probably, from that consideration, most of his Majesty's Ministers have become Volunteers. But, what kind of example are they likely to give? Why, if the French should invade this country, they would immediately desert; for they must either desert their offices or the Volunteer Corps, and it is easy to judge what choice thy would make. No doubt they would, previous to their desertion, apologise to the Corps they might belong to, that a necessary attendance at their ministerial duties obliged them to depart. And what would be the effect of such apologies on the different Corps? Why this, that it would be a precedent to justify the desertion of every other Volunteer, who could assign any plausible reason of pressing business, &c.; I see no good example, nor any public spirit in such things. This vaunted influence of example, however, is quite of a piece with the theatrical, ostentatious foppery of the Volunteer system, which seems only fit for nothing but to be put on the top of a hill to be looked at.&#x2014;It is quite a different kind of thing when a gentleman puts himself at the head of any Corps, where he can be of use. For instance, the right hon. gent, who opened the debate (Mr. Windham), is, I find, a Volunteer Officer in his own county, where, from local circumstances, he probably may be of more use than any other person, or in any other way.&#x2014;As to the affair of the exemptions, it is the crudest thing I ever heard of. I thought I could see a great deal of regret in the. Sec. of State's speech on that point. But his reason is truly curious. He says, 'Why did not you all tell me of it? It's all your own fault. You were all placed here to watch me, and you said nothing.' A great number of Volunteers, as has been observed, were enrolled without any exemption whatever. There were several parishes, where people entered into subscriptions to provide for the Army of Reserve. Substitutes have risen to an enormous price, frequently to &#x00A3;50. Parishes cannot get them. Poor men, who never were Volunteers, who cannot afford it, are too old, or perhaps infirm, insure; by and by, comes another ballot, till the parish pays off its whole debt, as the219case is in many parishes in the county where I live.&#x2014;As to the arms: the ordnance, it is said, had as many as could be expected. I am not quite of that opinion; it might have been so in former times, but in a modern view of the business, I say, with the foresight Ministers say they had of the designs of the enemy, it ought to have been better stored. They concluded their peace would not last; we, who were \"Nature's fools\" and mere idiots, could not know that. But did they provide for war? My credulity must be greater than they thought it, before I can bring myself to believe it. But did they think of a war with France without the threat of attempting an invasion? It seems hardly possible. It was, therefore, necessary to guard against it. I say that, in such case, they must have seen the necessity of providing more than 300,000 muskets. Why they should seem so disposed to boast of the state of the country, I don't know, unless it be that they are themselves really surprised at their own exertions. They have been quite astonished; and, looking round on one another, 'Oh,' say they, 'who could have thought it? We never could have imagined that we were capable of such exertions.' Of the country it was impossible for them to think meanly: nor do I see why any man should be surprised or astonished to see Englishmen coming forward manfully to defend themselves. What they might think of themselves is another matter: if they foresaw the danger, there could be no impediment to foreseeing the want of arms. I do hope, that some things have lately happened to render that danger less. I say, that if Admiral Cornwallis could, during the week Parliament met, lay off Brest with his fleet, and effectually blockade that port, he has materially lessened the danger, and has gained laurels as great at most as ever were gained by a victory. The utmost degree of praise is due to that gallant Commander for his skill and bravery in this most important affair, which I think of the highest consequence to the Country. I certainly however by no means say, that on that account we ought to relax at all in our defensive preparations. But here perhaps I may be biassed. Always thinking an invasion attended with many difficulties, and particularly under these circumstances, but deeming it equally necessary to be fully on our guard against it; I say, I may be biassed, but I can't help saving, go on in your preparations, but let them be such as may be most speedily convened into the means of offensive warfare, and if I gave an additional vote to night, it should be to the regular army.&#x2014;Now, Sir,220having stated my difficulties as to the converting the. Volunteer Corps into a foundation for the regular army, I wish to say a word as to their duration, more particularly as the Noble Lord spoke of them as not being intended for temporary purposes. Now suppose, whether justly or unjustly, the war should become, in any respect, unpopular, if you should exact from the Volunteers nothing but what is perfectly compatible with their other necessary pursuits of life, they will go on very well; but I think, that on the petty pay allowed them, should certain circumstances, unforeseen at present, arise, I the keeping of them up, on their present footing, may not be impossible, but I will say improbable. The Noble Lord talked of making us a military nation. I do not see the matter exactly in the same light with him; but I have no objection to see the nation more military in its character even in time of peace, so far as that every class of persons should be better skilled in the use of arms; peasants, artizans, and commercial men, &c.; This would be of considerable advantage to the country. But we are asked, how else are the people to be employed in the public service? Why, the Sec. at War says, he is not a military man. Modesty is a good quality. But I humbly think, that at a time when the country is threatened with a formidable invasion, and we are raising such immense forces to oppose it, the Sec. at War should be somewhat of a military man. But he refers to General Officers. Every General Officer, I think, will tell him, that the best way of arming the people, is by training them to their proper uses.&#x2014;I cannot help repeating the opinion which I gave last session, and upon which a motion was ineffectually made in this House; namely, that there I should be a responsible military authority, to which the Parliament and the people might look for the whole conduct of the army department. I have great personal respect for H. R. H. the Commander in Chief, but I am persuaded, from my personal knowledge of his character, that he would not be pleased with the flattery, that he is himself capable of the very difficult task of governing this department. It requires, above all, that the responsibility should be clear and positive. I may be allowed to say, that there is an obstacle in his high birth to the responsibility which belongs to his situation. There is a delicacy in questioning the measures of a personage of his illustrious rank, which deters men in general from the duty of calling him to account. It is not too much to say, that all the arrangements of the mili221tary system for the last summer have been unsteady, vascillating and capricious. Early in the summer a staff was appointed, which, to say no worse of it, gave considerable surprize to military men. Generals were appointed to the command of districts, who no doubt had just pretensions to employment, but men were disposed to enquire why others of the greatest experience, gallantry and distinction were omitted! Names were missed that, in a situation of the country so critical, ought, in the public opinion, to have been the first thougt of. Thus it was conceived that Lord Cornwallis was not so old as to be overlooked; and surely my noble friend, Earl Moira, was not so destitute of activity, zeal, energy, and experience as to be left unemployed. And yet, in the first instance, his name was not to be found. A general promotion, however took place, and this altered the arrangement;&#x2014;Lord Hutchinson, who had been employed at first, was now put off the staff, and Earl Moira was most properly appointed to the chief command in Scotland&#x2014;an appointment which gave me the highest satisfaction, as it must do to every one who truly regarded the defence of the country; but why, if the noble earl was proper to be trusted with a great military station in Oct. was he overlooked in May? It was answered to all this, that it was the King's prerogative to change his Generals, and that he might change them every day. Most true it is his prerogative, but his ministers are responsible for the exercise of this prerogative capriciously. The country have a right to the employment of the best talents and experience that the army can supply, and the characters of officers are an essential part of the public strength. Men are not to be changed by caprice. Where nothing has happened to alter the circumstances, it betrays a levity inconsistent with the character of a strong and efficient government to change, take officers up, and put them down without a reason assigned, or an argument of any kind.&#x2014;Every part of the service has been left to chance. Even in raising the Army of Reserve, there was the same want of attention. After men had paid &#x00A3;40 or &#x00A3;50 to find a substitute for the Army of Reserve, and the substitute had marched to the appointed rendezvous, he found no one there to receive him. This had happened in many instances, and the substitutes net knowing what to do with themselves or their money, had deserted in post chaises and four. Was there ever an admistration so trusted, so supported&#x2014;so left with almost? uncontrolled power as the present&#x2014;with the spirit of the country raised to the highest enthusiasm&#x2014;with no party differences to mo-222lest them&#x2014;with the Lords Lieutenants of the Counties all eager to second their views; and yet what had they done with all this power? Had it not been the chief employment of those Lords Lieutenants to comprehend the instructions they had received&#x2014;the explanation of the explanations had occupied almost all their time; and not merely in regard to their signals in Norfolk, but to all their system there had been such a system of confusion, contradiction and vascillation as to make it impossible for the proper officers to understand what they were to do. I am speaking now of their military system, not of their boasted income act, of which we shall hear enough hereafter.&#x2014;Now I am speaking on the general subject of ministerial changes and confusion, I am led to mention a circumstance respecting a near relation of mine (General Fox), concerning whom the conduct of government has been such as I cannot comprehend. He was sent, after the commencement of the war, to a very high and important command (in Ireland); an appointment at which I felt much more of anxiety than of pleasure, notwithstanding the knowledge I had of his character. A disturbance broke out in Dublin on the 23d of July, in which Lord Kilwarden was murdered. It excited universal astonishment, and in a few days: he was no longer commander in chief. I may be told, indeed, that his departure thence proceeded from his own request: but from all I have been able to learn upon the subject, a wish on the part of the civil government of Ireland was expressed, that he should be recalled. After this, there was no man of spirit but would say, \"I will no longer stay in your way, since you wish my removal.\" When becomes over here, he is immediately entrusted with the high and honourable command of a district near the metropolis, a clear proof that ministers did not think ill of his conduct. But why then was he recalled? Because, it seems, it was the wish of the Irish civil government. I say, that this circumstance happening so very soon after the 23d of July, who would not feel themselves justified in saving that it was in consequence of misconduct? Did both parties, the civil power and the commander in chief, act perfectly well? How? By getting intelligence? By following up that intelligence? Was it true that the Lord Lieut, instructed the commander in chief, and then withdrew to the Phoenix-Park, a few hours before Lord Kilwarden was murdered? Nothing that I can see but a surprize, a total and complete surprize, can justify the Irish government in that affair,223or they must be a sort of accomplices in the murder of Lord Kilwarden. It ought to be publicly known, that whatever intimation was given to the commander in chief, was given with an idea that it was not to be relied upon. Not even the Lord Mayor knew any thing of it: and, when it is alledged (pitiful excuse!) with great formality, that the superintendant magistrate of the city of Dublin was informed of it, pray was he directed to communicate it to the Lord Major? If he was, he did not execute his orders. Was there any one civil magistrate active on the occasion? And yet it was afterwards insinuated that blame lay where there was not the smallest reason to lay it, and the Lord Lieut, wishes for a new appointment of the commander-ship in chief. I have heard of other and very different reasons. The press in Ireland, though not so much enslaved as at Fans, is, I believe, not so unshackled as it is here, and is not very likely to convey to the world that which is thought to be disagreeable at the Castle. Well, Sir; from this press, a paragraph has made Us appearance, slating, \"that the Commander in Chief was the brother to Mr. Charles Fox, of the English House of Commons, that he was first cousin to the Duke of Leinster, and, of course, was related to the late LordEdward Fitzgerald.\" This, Sir, was a strange offence, if, indeed, it was an offence at all. No man of Gen. Fox's rank has, I believe, mixed less, at any time, in the politics of the day. What could be the true cause of his recal, I know not; for I, who am no judge of military matters, must, setting aside feelings of relationship, consider him to be a good officer, after his recent appointment. What, then, was it that induced the Lord Lieut, and his Majesty's ministers to act with such unexampled, such unaccountable caprice? I say there must have been some scandalous inattention at the Castle. Strange conduct! They are actuated only by the dread of giving alarm. From morning till night they do not seem afraid of riot and murder, but of giving alarm. I, for my part, wish the citizens of Dublin had been alarmed, and then there might have been some safety. But why all this fear of alarm? Why, but because there was a charm which they feared would be broken. Why, but because the friends of government had been crying out here last spring&#x2014;\"All's safe! All's well!\" and then were afraid of the idea of danger. \"This will spoil all our story, and we shall never be believed again. If the danger goes off we are safe. There has been no alarm; if danger breaks224out we must run the risk; but we will take our chance for it\"&#x2014;There is another subject of a still higher nature, on which I feel it my duty to say a few words; I mean, the situation of the Heir Apparent of the Crown. Last session, we understood, he had made very handsome offers of his services to government. Not only were they then not accepted, but nothing since, it appears, has been done to soothe his mind, or carry into effect his liberal and honourable offer. I shall hear, that this matter is dependent on the. prerogative of the Crown. Who questions it? But are we to understand from that, that the King's will is every thing, and the public opinion nothing? This may be very good doctrine, but I must say lam too old to learn it. I should think this a subject on which I may claim a right to observe, because I consider the active services of the Prince of Wales of great importance in our present situation, for exciting the spirit of the country, and, therefore, is being a material part of the public defence. I hope, and indeed am inclined to think, that there is as much loyally in this country as there ever was at any former period. To all loyal persons, must it not be grateful to see the Heir Apparent actively employed in the contest, and sharing, with the public at large, in the danger and in the glory of defending the country? That danger, notwithstanding my confidence in our success, may God forbid! But are you to be justified in omitting to use such material means? He has been long in the army. Itwasnatural for him to say&#x2014;\"My situation in society is such, that rank is an inferior consideration; whether I am colonel or general, is of little importance.\" But atpresent,is not the case quite different? \"If France lands her armies on our shores, all your other brothers in the army shall have a high command; but you, under the colour of saving you from danger, shall be deprived of any glorious opportunity.\" Look at his situation! At the head of the regiment he commands&#x2014;but who thinks that to be colonel of a regiment of light horse, is a situation, in times like these, fit for the Prince of Wales? I can easily imagine, that such is the frame of some men's minds, that they could reconcile themselves to the idea of shutting him up like an Eastern Monarch; but I am sure his mere colonelcy is what no man here will say is a situation becoming him. I cannot enter into motives. I am sure the consequences will be honourable to the Prince of Wales, and not so to those who have advised his Majesty to refuse his offer,225They may by such advice Kike away from him an opportunity of rendering himself popular, and becoming one of the most beloved princes in our history Why this is not desirable, I really cannot understand. We, however, have a right to state to ministers our opinions upon a subject, to which we may think the interests of the public are deeply concerned, and which certainly involves topics peculiarly grateful to the feelings of the Prince of Wales.&#x2014;lI hope, Sir, that this d bate will have a good effect upon the public mind; and that they will see the Parliament disposed to look that ministers do justice to their energies, and to the burthens they chearfully bear: for their voluntary expenses are as real a burthen as their taxes. I hope the people will see that we are ready to do what is owing to their love of freedom, their public spirit, and their zeal and bravery in the public cause.", "author_id": "/people/mr-charles-fox-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

He does not say, I never knew of such a wish, but \"I see no complaint against General Fox.\" This is no answer whatever, and the right hon. gent, had better have wrapped himself up in state silence, than have made any such reply. To evade is next to saying nothing. He is silent as to the Prince of Wales; as to the affairs of Ireland he evades the question. How is it possible the Lord Lieut., I again repeat, could at such a moment wish the recall of the commander in chief, and not cast a censure on him? It could not be. I assert that government here, when they knew the disposition and opinion of the government of Ireland, did not take proper means to investigate the cause of their wish, and ascertain where the blame, in fact, existed. In such a state of the case it is trifling to say no censure is implied. It is not consistent with common sense to exact martial law and suspend theHabeas Corpus Act, for a riot so contemptible, as the rising of the 23d of July was now represented.

I have some reasons to think, that the government of Ireland was well attached to the commander in chief, and that between him and the Lord Lieut, a perfect good-will subsisted, previous to the events of the 23d. After that period a coolness arose between them; the abuses which took place, might have arisen from certain rumours, traceable to the castle. As to one, I can say, he conceived the other had spoken of him in a way which he did not deserve, and that he had not been informed, as it was intimated, of the intended rising on the 23d. If he had been so informed, was it not natural the lord mayor would have been told? It is impossible it could be otherwise. I repeat again, that the government of Ireland must have been surprised, or they were accomplices in the death of Lord Kilwarden. In the same situation, I equally should have said the same of the commander in chief. The question is, whether that officer had communicated to him any sufficient ground of alarm, to authorize him to take measures of precaution, and, in particular, to apprize Col. Brown of the risk. What, if it can proved that the Lord Lieut, gave him orders not to alarm any one! And, as to the steps taken by him, what, if his lordship sent to express his surprise, and said, I suppose, by what you are doing, you must act on some information unknown to me! The letter sent to the commander in chief was not received; so the Lord Lieut, had more ground than he to conceive the extent of the danger. On the existence of a coolness, which compelled the government here to choose between the Lord Lieut, and commander in chief, they did, as was natural, determine for the former; but what I complain of is, that they never instituted any inquiry into the cause of that coolness. It was, however, obvious to common observation, that two such persons could not originate a misuuder-231standing on light grounds. This should have been done; they should not have been like the Lord Lieut., fearful of giving alarm; but, inquiring into the cause of the coolness, they should, if they found his lordship's insinuation groundless, have given him a reprimand.", "author_id": "/people/mr-charles-fox-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

The first objection was, that no facts were produced to justify the necessity of the measure. The second objection was drawn from the thinness of the members particularly connected with Ireland, and best fitted to give information to the house on the subject. With regard to the first objection, it was unnecessary for him to take up the time or attention of the house. His right hon. friend had fully removed this objection, and he heartily agreed with his right hon. friend, that if the measure were not renewed, the same system of terror, which had been alluded to, would immediately be renewed in ail its horrors. With regard to the thinness of the attendance of members connected with Ireland, he should make one or two remarks. Having been very recently in Ireland, and having had occasion to ascertain what were the sentiments of at least three-fourths of the Irish members resident in that country, as to the expediency and necessity of the measure, he requested the house, on his veracity, to be assured, that they were to a man convinced, that the re-enactment of the bill was indispensably necessary to the preservation of tranquillity, and to the protection of all loyal subjects. They were so thoroughly convinced of its necessity, that they expected the re-enactment of the bill would be one of the earliest acts of the session. If they had not indulged such an expectation, they would, at this moment, have been in their places to solicit its re-enactment. This sentiment, of the necessity of the measure, he might add, was not confined to members, but was entertained by every loyal man in every part of the country. He, himself, had been the only Irish member, who had expressed doubts respecting the loyalty of the lower orders, in opposition to the opinion of a number of other most respectable individuals. He rejoiced to find, that the opinion he entertained of the disloyalty of the lower orders was erroneous, and that the spirit of disaffection was much less general than he had dreaded. At this moment all good men of every party were animated with feelings of loyalty, and convinced of the necessity of defending the country against the common enemy. Every man who possessed only 20184a year, was now disposed to unite against all foreign and domestic foes.

But whilst I look on this side, of the question, and admit the expediency of affording relief to these men, who must otherwise labour under considerable difficulties, I ought not to neglect to glance a little at the other side, and observe the circumstances that form more than a counter-balance to the necessities of the curates, and that is the necessities of the country. In the present situation of the country, so burthened with taxes, to support the arduous contest in which we are engaged, nothing can excuse a compliance with an application of this sort, but the most absolute necessity. In the present instance, I am by no means satisfied, that such a necessity does exist. The clergy, who before kept curates, but who are now compelled to reside on their livings, may very well spare a maintenance for those who were in the habit of performing the duty of their functions, until another provision shall occur. The clergy are certainly able to afford this expense, as it is notorious, that the value of their livings have of late received a very ample increase.

Inconsequence they warned the civil magistrates, at the head of which was the superintendant of Dublin. The mistake is, that officer is unknown here. The lord mayor of Dublin is not like the lord mayor of London. It is not he, but the superintendent who has the charge of the peace.

He meant, however, to make only a few observations on the subject of the motion. To ascertain the situation of that part of the empire it was scarcely necessary to advert to the situation of its capital, in which every inhabitant was obliged to place a list of all75the inmates of his house on his door. In such circumstances there could scarcely a doubt exist of the propriety of making some efforts to establish the tranquillity of the country upon some solid and per ma meat grounds. It had been said that this was not the proper time; but the noble lord would ask, what would be a better time? Were we now going on well, or was the country well? This was a crisis when the exertions of every individual in the empire were necessary, for the defence and security of the empire. He contended it was the most proper time to resort to measures that would have the effect of removing every source of complaint, and of uniting every arm in the common cause. His lordship wished to be informed, whether his Majesty's ministers had any specific plan in contemplation for that purpose. There seemed to be but one sentiment in the house with respect to the necessity of uniting heart and hand in the present arduous crisis.

He had made it his business to examine into the subject with the greatest care, and he had endeavoured to ascertain the sentiments of persons the best informed on matters connected with the situation of Ireland; and the result, of his inquiries had been, a conviction that it would, for the present, be expedient not to press the motion. He begged leave, however, to be indulged with making a few observations, to shew that he had not taken up the idea without due consideration, or without endeavouring to avail himself of every means of correct knowledge on a subject of such was importance and in475terest. The present situation of the paper currency in Ireland was one which ought to excite the utmost vigilance and anxiety. It was a subject to which he had felt it his duly seriously to call the attention of ministers and of the House. The measure of restriction generally, he could not help thinking a great national evil. It struck him not only as a great but a growing calamity. It was an evil to the termination of which there was held out no reasonable prospect. It had, in the first instance, been introduced during the continuance of a war, but he could not admit, as a matter of course, that war was in itself any justification for so dangerous an expedient. We had seen it renewed during peace, and now that, unfortunately, the country was again plunged in war, there was as little hope as ever of its being abandoned. The consequence of these repeated renewals of the measure of restriction had been, that the paper currency of Ireland had increased to a most alarming extent, and the evils attendant on this increase had been manifested in a proportionate degree. There evils he had long reckoned great, but the farther lie extended his researches, the more was he convinced, that they were greater than he had, in the first instance, conceived. He needed not rest any assertions on the subject of a too widely circulated paper currency on his own authority. The doctrines of Adam Smith on this point were clear and explicit, and such an authority could not be lightly regarded. Depreciation was the necessary and constant result of such extensive circulation of paper. At the lime theBank of Ireland Restriction Billpassed the Irish House of Commons, the amount of bank notes issued was 600,000l., and at this moment he found that their amount was not less than 2,700.000l.Thus there was, by the measure of restriction, an increase to the amount of two millions. On the other hand, what was the proportion of the gold coin to be balanced against this quantity of paper money? When he allowed it to be about a million, he was sure that he went as far as any hon. member could desire. In stating its amount in this manner, he rather overrated it than estimated it below its real extent. At this time the price given fat gold coin in Ireland was considerably higher than? the standard price of bullion. Gold coin rose in price exactly in proportion as paper currency was depreciated in value. Betwixt Dublin and Belfast, though there was not a distance of more than a hundred miles, there was a difference of exchange to the amount of ten per cent. Hut the Heel of the depreciation of money476was felt still more strongly on the rate of exchange betwixt this country and Ireland. For a number of years, the rate of exchange betwixt London and Dublin had fluctuated from 8 or 9 to 16 per cent, to the disadvantage of Ireland. But now the loss was far more considerable. It was as high as 17, 18 and even 19 percent. In some, instances it was not less than 20; and thus an Irish gentleman who came to attend his duty in Parliament, found, at the end of his journey, where he had allotted 500l.for his expenses, that 400l.only were really to be received. This was a view of the subject which could not fail to make a very powerful impression, and shewed in the clearest point of view what was the consequence of protracting the measure of restriction. On this point he should have felt himself very happy at receiving any information from the right hon. member who brought forward the motion, as to the probable period when the bill would be discontinued. He would be glad to be. told, under what circumstances it was that the payment in cash were to be resumed. It was not easy to ascertain what was to be the situation of the country when the restriction should be removed. It was evident that the payment of cash would not be resumed without a certain degree of difficulty and danger. There would in all probability be a run on the bank for some time, and consequences of a serious nature might be experienced, unless means were taken to counteract them. The longer, however, the restriction was continued, the greater would be the eventual danger, and the more difficult would it be to counteract it. From a retrospect of the past, the hope of the removal of the restriction could not be sanguine; and he appealed to the candour of those gentlemen who voted for the bill at its first introduction, whether they would have given such a vote, if they had then looked to this protracted continuance of the bill. He conjured gentlemen to think seriously on this point, and to use every exertion to procure a remedy for a very alarming evil.&#x2014;The subject of the Irish silver currency was well worthy of their attention. He appealed to the right hon. gent, whether it was not in a situation absolutely disgraceful and degrading. He had felt it his duty to make these few observations, and hoped that those whose duty it was to look more particularly into the affairs of Ireland, would lose no time in devising some means for curing the evils now necessarily connected with the currency of that part of the united kingdom.", "author_id": "/people/lord-archibald-hamilton", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1804", "feb", "13"], "content": "in a maiden speech, delivered his sentiments on the subject before the House to the following purport. He was convinced that his noble friend who introduced the subject was perfectly correct in the observations which he had made on the motion for going into the Committee, and thought him entitled to the thanks of the House for the manner in which he had brought it under consideration. Ho allowed, that the amount of the issues of paper money by the Bank, of Ireland was not itself a lair criterion, of judging of the propriety of this increased circulation. It was, however, a circumstance which could not fail to excite surprise, and certainly loudly demanded inquiry, that the issues of paper by the Bank of Ireland had been five times greater since the restriction bill had been passed than they previously were, whereas the issues by the Bank of England had, in proportion to the capital, increased only in the proportion of one-filth beyond what they were when the act was passed. It might be true, that the directors of the Bank of Ireland might not hold themselves subject to responsibility for this extraordinary increase of their paper; but, surely, that House was responsible, after committing to these directors a power as extensive as ever was committed to a public body, the power of manufacturing paper for national circulation. This was indeed a great delagation of authority, for all economists agreed that money was power. When such powers were delegated, it was, undoubtedly, the duty of Parliament, to see in what manner they were exerted, to ascertain what were the evils connected with the system on which they acted, and to adopt such remedies as appeared most adapted to their situation. He did not mean to say that this was a subject to be entered on rashly, or that the investigation of it did not require the utmost temperance and moderation. Still, however, he had no difficulty in declaring, that the discussion of it was highly expedient, and that this discussion might be attended with the most beneficial effects. It was a subject480which ought strongly and deeply to impress the minds of the members of that House. The depreciation of paper in Ireland was constantly increasing, and must, as long as it existed, be productive of the most alarming consequences. The balance of trade must continue unfavourable to Ireland as long as the depreciation continued, and the merchant must continue to resort to the foreign maket instead of home manufacture. The present, depreciation could not be described as arising from any thing in the commerce of the country for the last year; because, during that year, the exports of Ireland had considerably exceeded the imports; but even if it were the case, it was an evil inseparable from the continuance of the restriction. As long as the merchants could obtain accommodation from the Bank by the issues of paper, and as long as the Bank found it advantageous to give this accommodation, no favourable change in the state of the exchange could be expected. The whole trade and property of Ireland was threatened with danger, if a change of system did not take place. This danger was already visible in a variety of circumstances. Since the time of the restriction, the Bank had encreased its dividends full one and a half per cent. At this time their dividends amounted to one and a half per cent.; and he was assured that this year they had determined to give an additional bonus of five per cent. Under these circumstances, the Bank had not only no motive to wish for the removal of theRestriction Act, but found it their interest to extend the circulation of their paper currency. He had to repeat, that, at this time, he thought it would be dangerous for Parliament to interfere without mature consideration; but the was most clearly of opinion that some strong measure ought without delay to be adopted. The, measure which struck him as being best calculated to prevent the growth of this evil, was a plan for compelling the directors to curtail their issues of paper money, and thus forcing the private bankers to adopt a similar practice. At present, the Bank of Ireland had no countrol over the private bankers, two of whom in Dublin issued paper to an amount as great as the whole of their paper circulation.

{"date": ["1804", "feb", "13"], "content": "said, this subject was certainly of great importance, but at the, same tune, he thought it was move simple than gentlemen in general seemed to imagine. It appeared to him clear, that the excess of paper circulation was the cause of the bad stale of exchange in that country. It had been stated in the. course of the debate, that there vas a difference of no less than ten per cent, in the exchange between different parts of Ireland, and it had been stated, that gold was purchased in the north, at a premium of ten per cent., and he was authorized to take this for granted, as it had482not been denied by any gentleman. There was a material difference that gentlemen should all keep in view between the banks of England and Ireland: in Ireland there was no bank that took upon itself to manage and regulate the circulation of the country; whereas, in England it was perfectly well known, that the bank commanded the whole paper circulation of the metropolis, and regulated that of the kingdom. The bank of Ireland was instituted after a great deal or opposition, and the private banks succeeded in obtaining permission to remain in the same state that they were before the national bank was established, and consequently had the power of issuing their paper for the circulation both of the metropolis arid the country. In England, there was no bank in the metropolis that interfered with the paper of the national bank; though the paper issued by the private banks in Dublin was, he had no doubt, upon very good security, yet, as they were not now bound to pay their own paper in specie, it naturally most be their interest to have as much of their paper in circulation as they could. The great object, therefore, which he wished to obtain, would be, if possible, to limit the circulation of private banks: another remedy which he thought might be applied, would be to make Irish bank paper exchangeable for that of the bank of England. At all events, this was a subject that called for the most serious attention of Parliament; and he had no doubt but that upon investigation, some effectual remedy might be Found out. With respect to the bill now before the House, he did not mean to oppose it, but he thought its duration should be limiited to a short time, in order that the subject might necessarily be again brought under the consideration of Parliament.

With regard to the point of time, he had not a moment to lose in making the observations which occurred to him respecting the formality of that petition, as the merits of the petition were to be taken into consideration to-morrow. But what he had to observe with respect to that petition would be best understood by a reference to the 26th of the King. The House would recollect, that for the better arrangement of petitions on controverted elections, several provisions had been made in that act, not only for preventing the penalties of the act, but also for preventing the presentation of undue and informal petitions one of those provisions stated, in a very plain and distinct manner, that the House could net proceed at all on386any petition, unless the persons whose names were subscribed to it claimed the right of voting at such election, or set forth a claim to a seat in that House in consequence of the result of such an election. The petition to which he alluded, and to which he intended to object, was signed by persons not stating their claim to a right to vote, or to a seat in that House in consequence of the issue of the Middlesex election; it was consequently a petition not squared and modelled agreeably to the provision of the act which he had already quoted. As to the proceedings of the House previous to the passing of that act, they were regulated on act of a more liberal or more loose construction.

{"date": ["1804", "feb", "02"], "content": "rose, agreeably to his notice of yesterday, to call the attention of the House to the petition of certain persons, styling themselves freeholders of Middlesex, complaining of the return for that county.&#x2014;The hon. member began by stating, that the point to be considered by the House was one so clear, and so little liable to any possibility of difference of opinion, that he did not conceive it necessary to occupy the time of the House with any detailed arguments. It would not, he conceived, be attempted to be denied that acts, of parliament were, in every case, to be interpreted in a manner, as nearly as possible, agreeably to the precise letter, and if this was admitted as a general principle, it could not be denied that such a mode of interpretation was more especially proper, when the act itself was framed for the express purpose of putting an end to vague ideas of the intentions of the legislature. The House had, on the present occasion, a very simple duty to perform. They had only to lay out of their consideration every idea but the positive mandatory injunctions of the act, and then their decision could not, even for a moment, become a matter of doubt. Gentlemen, he was convinced, need not be reminded of the circumstances which originally gave rise to the389Grenville act. It was an act expressly founded on the bad opinion entertained of the House of Commons in the exercise of its judicial powers. It was an act originating in constitutional jealousy, and designed to correct an evil, the existence of which all parties admitted. Having said this, it was proper for him to add, that the act, which originally encountered the strongest opposition, had, from experience, been found productive of the most beneficial effects. Those who had originally resisted it with the greatest zeal, had seen reason to alter their opinion, and those who were, in the first instance, its warmest opponents, had become its most sincere admirers. He had no hesitation in admitting that he himself was among this number. It was, therefore, not to be denied, that the origin of the act was 3 virtual admission that the House collectively were very bad judges of law, so far as it concerned the mode in which the fairness of elections was to be decided. After the passing of theGrenville Act, in the first instance, the obvious conclusion was, that all discretion was taken away from the House, and that every thing connected with election petitions was to be regulated by the precise provisions of the act. It was quite impossible to dispute the truth of this position. So much, however, was the legislature impressed with the idea that this was the clear meaning of the act, that it was judged necessary to bring in a bill to put this matter, if possible, in a still clearer point of view.&#x2014;By the act of the 28th of his Majesty, the power of the House in receiving or rejecting petitions was clearly defined. In that act it was exactly stated what was the description of petitions on which the House were to proceed, and what was the nature of those which could not, consistent with the spirit and provisions of the original act, be admitted. In the original act, it was positively intended that all power of preliminary judgment should be taken away from the House. It was declared, that if petitions were of such and such a nature, they should be laid before a Committee; but that if they were of a different description and character, they should be declared inconsistent with the provisions of the act, which was to regulate all proceedings relative to controverted elections. These original provisions might, perhaps, in strict interpretation, have been conceived to be sufficient; but lest any possibility of mistake should arise, lest any circumstances should occur which might endanger a recurrence to the decision of the House, which was taken for granted to be highly liable to error; the: 28th of his Majesty had in view the direct390prevention of any such inconvenience. It was meant to declare all preliminary decisions beyond their reach. It was to bind the House to receive petitions under certain specified circumstances, and to reject others in which particular allegations were not distinctly laid down. With this view of die subject, he felt himself called to state his preliminary objection to the House's entertaining the petition. The House was bound by positive statute; and, if so, he was not to be told of precedents, which, even if they did exist, could prove nothing against a direct enactment of the legislature. But, with respect to precedents, he really could not conceive that, in the short interval of sixteen years since the passing of the act of the 28th of his Majesty, such precedents could be found, or attempted to be urged on the present occasion. Admitting, however, that they exist, it would be monstrous and absurd to urge them as reasons for contravening a law drawn up in clear, intelligible, incontrovertible terms. To limit the jurisdiction of a court, and to direct the mode in which its future proceedings were to be regulated, might be wise, under particular circumstances. After these regulations were formed, however, they must be obligatory. It was needless for him to impress on the House the absurdity of first forming rules for the direction of a particular court, and then suffering the decisions of that court to go directly in the face of the previous rules for the conduct of its proceedings. In this case the original act was rendered totally ridiculous, and the decisions of a court defeated the regulation which was meant to prevent its irregularities or errors. The clause in the act on which he rested his motion, was one so couched, as, in his mind, to remove all possibility of doubt, ft struck him as being one of the most simple and conclusive in the Statute Book. In the clause of the act it was distinctly declared, that the House were not to admit to the consideration of a Committee, a petition in the body of which it was not stated, on behalf of those who signed it, that they had a right, at the time of the election, to vote as unexceptionable freeholders. Now, in this case, the persons signing the petition in question had done no such thing. If they had even claimed their right indirectly, there might have been some room for consider ration, how far the petition could, consistently with the law of Parliament, be received. But here there was nothing actually alleged, which could at all authorize the House in receiving the petition. It was, forsooth, signed by free holders He did not mean to391deny, that those who signed the petition were freeholders, or that they might not have bad a right to vote. But why had they pot stared this in their petition? He himself was a freeholder of Middlesex at the time of the election, but under circumstances which prevented him from exercising his elective franchise. Many others, he believed, were in a similar situation; and how then was the House to presume, that those who signed the petition were not in the same circumstances, since they had not themselves produced any proofs of their qualification at the time of the election? There were many persons freeholders now, who were not entitled to vote when the election took place. It was the simplest process in the world for the petitioners to have declared, in the body of the presume, their right of voting, if they did at the time of the election possess it; but it was too much to call on the House to presume their right, in express contempt of an act of parliament. A freehold property of forty shillings a year was what the law required as a qualification to vote for a county member; but, in the first instance, the House had nothing whatever to do with this qualification, when a petition was first laid on their table. He would, in illustration of his opinion, put a strong case, which, in proportion as it was strong, would more clearly illustrate his idea of the meaning of the act. If a petition were presented, not by the real freeholders of Middlesex, but by a tumultuous crowd assembled at the door of that House, assuming the name of freeholders; even if an outrage of this audacious nature were practised, his would affirm, that, in the first instance, the petition must be received and sent to a Committee. The paper, such as it. was, purported to be the petition of Middlesex freeholders, and the House had no authority to take cognizance of the fraud in the first instance. It was with the Committee to ascertain and to punish such an attempt to impose on the legislature, liven admitting that the present petition were signed by Sarah or Jodah, instead of William and Thomas, Mill it must go to the Committee, and with them rested the ultimate decision. The petition contained allegation?, and till his Committee had determined on its merits, the House had no right to presume that they were false. With the fact the louse could have DO interference. The law requited that every petition should contain certain allegations, and the question was, whether those who signed the petition had complied with its requisitions. Had they claimed their right to vote392at the last election? If they had, then the argument was at an end. If they had not, then the question was equally resolved, unless the House were disposed to decide in the face of a positive law. The petitioners might be very respectable individuals, as he had no doubt they were, and it might appear, on examination, that their right to vote was undoubted; all this might be safely admitted, and still the question would stand precisely where it did before the matter was agitated.&#x2014;The only point was to consider how far the petition was drawn in such terms as could bring the consideration of its merits under the provisions of theGrenville Act. There might be a great appearance of equity in the case, but still the law must be permitted to have its force. If cases of equity were to supersede statutes, the beneficial effects of which were universally admitted, legislative provisions were a mere nullity. The honourable gentleman here noticed the petition which he had himself presented on the subject of the conduct of the high bailiff of Westminster, in the famous contested election of 1784. He believed, that there never was a case laid down in any petition of more obvious and striking equity than that petition contained. The majority of the House were convinced of this, even while they resisted the admission of the petition. They rested their opposition solely on the ground of the allegations which it contained, not being such as theGrenville Acthad specified to be necessary, previous to the introduction of any petition. So sensible were the House of the necessity of rigidly adhering to the previsions of the act, that a petition confessed to be equitable in itself was rejected, and a short time afterwards a new act was introduced, to remedy an admitted inconvenience. As the law now stood, the matter was reduced to the simplest principles. Whatever was the matter of the petition, the House were to leave it wholly to the Committee. They were not to deliberate or decide. They were to admit or reject a petition, not because the admission or rejection was wise, or the contrary, not because it was or was not founded in equity, but because the provisions of the act Were peremptorily mandatory, and were not under any circumstances to be disobeyed. The legislature was now strictly bound to the observance of a particular mode of proceeding, and it was quite absurd to think of getting rid of it. He had heard of petitions of a description similar to the present having been admitted, and afterwards submitted to a Committee, For his own part, he was ig-393norant of the existence of such precedents; bat even if they did exist, their existence did not at all invalidate his argument. It might have happened accidentally, but was that to be seriously urged as an argument to shew, that when an error was discovered it was not to be rectified? If the act unequivocally pointed out a particular mode of proceeding, was a precedent directly in the teeth of its provisions to be brought forward to justify subsequent irregularity? It would hardly be contended, that if an evil was found to exist, that no means should be taken to correct it, because it had escaped observation in a variety of preceding instances, and when the means of correction were at once easy and efficacious. The proper mode of administering the correction in the present instance was by discharging the petition. On this matter, his own mind was completely satisfied. He wished, if there should be two opinions, which he hardly expected, that gentlemen who should take a view of the subject different from what he did, would explain what other meaning could be attached to the clause of the act than that which he attached to it. If the construction which he had put on the clause was not correct, he was desirous of being informed what description of petition it was, to which the clause was referred, He really was at a loss to conceive, how the act could express any meaning, if the meaning which he had affixed to it were objected to. He would put a case in illustration of his opinion. He would put the case of a petition signed by persons who were merely copyholders, signing a petition, in the body of which petition, they claimed a right of voting at the election. It was clear that they had no right of voting, and perhaps gentlemen would immediately contend that such a petition was to be instantly rejected as a matter of course. He could not, however, at all accede to this opinion. It was clear that the petition would be found to be eventually frivolous; but it did not at all follow, that in the first instance it was not to be submitted to a Committee, to judge of its merits. There was another case still more important, the consideration of which, indeed, would in all probability form the basis for the final decision of (he Committee of the Middlesex petitions. This was the case of the joint tenants, which was known to have excited a great deal of interest. If it had been the case of a body of electors who were in a situation to be rated, but had never actually paid the rate, presenting a petition, he was not at all prepared to say that the House would be entitled to reject the petition, be-394cause they entertained an opinion that the petitioners would ultimately fail in proving the fairness of their claims. The same principle he would apply to a petition from persons claiming a right of voting at the election for the county. It would not be argued for a moment, that a petition from these joint tenants was to be rejected, because the House might imagine that their claim to the right of election was altogether erroneous. Such a decision would be equally irregular and unjust. It would be prejudging what was afterwards to come before the Committee. It would be an attempt to execute that very office which, by the passing of theGranville Act, the House was declared incapable of performing with fairness and impartiality. The House could not argue the question of the competency of any petitioners complaining of an undue election. They had not the evidence on which any fair decision could be formed. They were not the court before which the general question was to be tried. It was very clear that copyholders had not a right of voting; but of a petition signed by copyholders, the House were not entitled to bold an opinion. He mentioned this case from its being so clear, and when he stated this, he meant to include in the observation the incompetence of the House to assume to themselves that right of determining the merits of petitions, which was reserved for a special tribunal. Whether petitioners had, or had not a right (o vote, was the subject of future consideration. The House had a simple task to execute. They were to determine, whether a petition complied with the terms of the act. In the present instance, he trusted, that he had shewn that the petition was irregular, and he should therefore conclude with moving, that the order of the day for the consideration of the petition of certain persons, stating themselves freeholders of Middlesex, be read.&#x2014;The order was read accordingly.&#x2014;Mr. Fox then moved, that the said order be discharged.&#x2014;The motion being put from the chair,", "author_id": "/people/mr-charles-fox-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1804", "feb", "02"], "content": "having answered this question in the affirmative, The right hon. gent. resumed, and contended that this was not what he, conceived to be at all in the contemplation of the legislature at the time the act was framed. All that was meant by the clause was, the general designation of freeholders should be observed. If the general qualification of the freeholders, and their right to vote was stated, then be would argue, that the plain, direct, common sense meaning of the clause was satisfied, and the mandatory injunctions of the act were fulfilled. The hon. gent had expressed his opposition to any argument drawn from precedents; but, for his own part, he thought that there was no more fair or parliamentary mode of construing the meaning of acts of the legislature. The people of this country would have reason to complain that they were hardly dealt by, if after the lapse of thirteen years, in which numerous instances of petitions drawn up in similar terms being admitted to a Committee, they were, in consequence of a mere inadvertency, to be deprived of a most im-396portant constitutional privilege. The precedents were indeed so numerous, that during the first session after the meeting of Parliament, subsequent to the passing of the act, there was hardly one to be found of an opposite description. He alluded here to the petition presented after the general election in 1790, and particularly noticed the petitions from Sterling, and Orkney and Shetland, which were both drawn up in terms similar to that now the subject of discussion; there was, however, no objection to their being submitted to the consideration of a Committee.&#x2014;A number of other petitions at that time were drawn in terms by no means the same as those which the hon. member contended to be essential. In many of them the petitioners described themselves as legal electors, or as freemen, but not as confining to the terms on which so much stress had been laid. The House were satisfied that the common sense meaning of the act had been fulfilled, and the petitions were sent to a Committee, for a decision of their merits. With all this body of precedents in their possession, he trusted that the House would not consent to entertain the hon. member's proposition. Cases of a much weaker sort than that now before the House had been sustained. The petitioners had,prima facie,a right to be considered as electors from their common law right as freeholders. It would, he considered, be very unjust to consider them disqualified, from the mere circumstance of their omitting to state in so many words, that at the last election their right existed in full force. It would bear particularly hard on them at the moment when they were prepared to support their allegation, and to vindicate their claims as freeholders, to be stopped short, as the hon. member had proposed, and thus be debarred all opportunity of asserting their most valuable constitutional rights. They had, at farthest, only been guilty of following what was a common practice; they had framed their petition on the same principles as that of which the Journals afforded numerous examples, and for this they were to be deprived of an opportunity of obtaining the redress of a grievance of the most serious and Oppressive kind! While he contended for the claim of the petitioners to have their petition laid before a Committee, it was far, indeed, from his intention to affirm, that before that Committee their claims were without examination to be admitted. It was before the Committee that the real merits of the question were to be decided. In admitting the petition now, the House hazarded no opinion of any description. They left397the whole question open for the fullest consideration. If the petitioners had assumed a false character; if they had imposed on the House by claims which were false, they would not eventually triumph by this fraud. Their falsehood would be detected, and they would softer the punishment which their duplicity would richly deserve. If they were women; if they were minors, or if their qualification was below the legal standard, then their petition must of course be rejected. It was too much, however, to presume, that they were disqualified, in the total absence of all evidence to establish such a position. In receiving the petition the House would he guided by practice. In rejecting it they would do what was equally rigorous and unjust.

The legislature has foreseen and provided for the case. We have no right to enter into any considerations external or collateral to the specific provision of the law. There is no appeal from the rigour of the Act of Parliament to the equity of this House. We have no legal competence to proceed in any petition against an undue return, in which the petitioners do not distinctly state or allege that they had a right of voting at the election. These petitioners have not made that allegation. But the Right Hon. the Chancellor of the Exchequer asserts, that these petitioners have followed the example of others; that the course of the House has been to proceed in petitions, in which the allegation of right has been omitted, and that they ought not to suffer because they cannot have been misled by following the practice of the House as they find it in the Journals. Certainly the right hon. gentleman's doctrine conveys an excellent instruction to the present and to all future petitioners, \"Do not look into the Act of Parliament, never inquire what the law prescribes, or how it directs you to act. All you have to do is to examine the Journals of the House of Commons, and govern yourselves by the precedents or course of proceeding. as you find it in those Journals.\" This, though not so delivered in terms, is the real result and amount of the right hon. gentleman's doctrine. Then, Sir, I ask who, and what is the House of398Commons, whose authority is set above that of the legislature? Why, Sir, it is, or rather it was a tribunal, whose decisions in matters of elections were so notoriously partial, whose disposition or capacity to try contested elections with fairness was so universally doubted, whose integrity on such, points was so much distrusted, that the legislature found it necessary to take the whole jurisdiction of such causes out of their hands; and who, by concurring in the act, that deprived them of their power, confessed that they deserved to lose it. I am not disposed to trust any thing to the discretion of the House of Commons, on questions, in which the legislature places no confidence in them; and, even if I were so disposed, the supreme power of Parliament has left me no discretion on the subject.", "author_id": "/people/sir-philip-francis", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1804", "feb", "02"], "content": "took an historical review of the custom of Parliament which preceded, and the motives which urged to, the introduction of the Act of the 10th of his present Majesty, commonly called theGrenville Act. The grounds of that act be described to be a strong jealousy of the discretion which the House had previously exercised in deciding upon election returns, and petitions relating thereto. The surrender of that discretion to Committees to be appointed by the House, precluded, in his apprehension, such a decision upon the ease then under discussion as the motion of the hon. gent. (Mr. Fox) called for. According to the form of proceeding which prevailed previous to the enactment of the law he referred to, he believed it would be found that the general, he would not say the invariable, rule was to receive petitions from those only who claimed the right of voting at the elections to which their petitions related, and who had an interest in the decision of the same. The cause of the change produced by the Act of the 10th arose from the strong persuasion which existed in the mind of the author of that act, that it was necessary, for the best purposes, to limit the authority of the House upon Election cases. The course prescribed by that act had gone on without any alteration until the period when the Act of the 28th of the King, upon a clause on which the motion professed to be grounded, was brought before the House, in consequence of its appearing that, notwithstanding the many advantages which resulted from the act of the 10th, to which the respectable mover of the bill of the 28th bore ample testimony, yet that in the instance of persons presenting petitions, it was safe and prudent to resort to the old established custom that prevailed antecedent to the former act, and to restore to the House some part of the discretion of which it had deprived itself by that act. From that consideration arose the clause now under debate, and, KS it struck his mind, the petition to which the motion alluded to, was not, in the point of formality so much insisted upon, inconsistent with the custom to which, after an experience of 16 years, the House, by the act of the 28th, had thought proper to recur.&#x2014;This observation he put as to the equity of the case, and, with respect to the actual mandatory words of the clause, as they were described, by the hon. mover, he put against this construction of that clause, the practice of the400House since the clause was enacted. From that comparison it appeared, that the interpretation given by the hon. gent. had not been acted upon. If the practice of the House had conformed precisely to the letter of the act of the 28th, he confessed that he would have felt more satisfied and pleased; and if in the petition referred to in the motion, that letter had been strictly complied with, it would, of course, have been more satisfactory, in order that the most invidious should have no room to cavil; but as a doubt did appear to exist, the best mode in his judgment, was to refer to the custom of the House previous to the passing of the act of the 10th, and also to the manner in which the law of the 28th had been acted upon, in order to assist in the solution of the question now under discussion, and to enable the House to determine upon the interpretations most fair and equitable to adopt. As to the application of the words of the clause to the terms in which the petition was drawn up, which it was the object of the motion to reject, he was decidedly against it, and in addition to the reasons he had already stated, he said, that there was another strong and powerful motive which operated upon his mind, to prompt him to the vote which he meant to give, and it was this, that it did not appear possible that the least inconvenience, hardship, or injustice could result to any individual, by allowing this petition to be proceeded on in the ordinary way, while it could not be denied that it would be serious injury to the petitioners to exclude them from the investigation of the subject of their petition, by acceding to the present motion. The petitioners only desired that their case should be sent to trial, and the object of the motion was to shut them out from that which they had a right to claim. Tinder circumstances where there existed any doubt as to the construction of the letter of the law, or the practice upon that law, he could have no hesitation in deciding in favour of the petitioners; and he would put it to the candour of the House whether such was not the more equitable mode of proceeding; for he was persuaded that according to the general understanding, the form of the petition was not liable to all the objections which were started against it. The question was now raised for the first time, and, although much ingenious argument had been offered in favour of the motion, from the reasons he had stated, it ought not to be adopted.", "author_id": "/people/mr-thomas-grenville", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

That any member should entertain a doubt upon the construction of the clause, which formed the ground-work of this motion, was to him a matter of astonishment. Nothing in legislation could be more clear and mandatory in terms, than the words of the clause in question. As to the case of Carmarthen, referred to by the right hon. gent. (the Chancellor of the Exchequer), it did not appear to him, a fair analogy to that before the House, It was, in fact, confounding the jurisdiction of a Committee with that of the House. The question now under consideration was, whether a petition should be proceeded on at all, and that was a question with which a Committee had nothing to do; for alter the case was referred to them, they were bound to proceed upon it. From this the learned gentleman argued; that the allusion to the conduct of the Committee upon the Carmarthen petition was not applicable to the case before the House. In the course of the discussion before that Committee, he recollected that nearly the same grounds of objection were taken, and the same topics started as those which were heard to-day. The precedents quoted by the right hon. gent. on the Treasury Bench, to shew the practice of the House, in contradistinction to the letter of the law, were particularly relied upon, and this led his mind to inquire what Was to be understood by precedents, and according to his opinion a practice which had gone on without any litigation as to its propriety, without any discussion upon its merits, could not be considered in the light of precedents. Yet this precisely was the nature of the precedents cited upon the present occasion. This was the first time this question was raised. \"The blot was hit,\" and the House was called upon to consider the construction of the act of the 28th, to which ins hon. friend referred, and to determine whether,ex vi termini,the petition in question was consistent with the clause of that act so often alluded to. The House should not suffer itself to be withdrawn from the fair consideration of the words of the act, by precedents which, in fact, proved but (hemalus ususapplied to it; but should rather imitate the conduct pursued by a court of law in the case of corporations, where, when aquo warrantois applied for against any corporation, the practice is, not to decide by any usage that might have prevailed, even if it had existed for 50 years, but402to look into the words of the charter, and upon that to ground the decision of the case.", "author_id": "/people/mr-joseph-jekyll", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

He was of opinion, that though the petition should be rejected, the parties were not deprived of the means of redress.

It was worth while to look at the course which this proceeding had taken; no objection whatever was started against this petition when it was presented. What was the reason why the hon. gent. who now brought this motion forward, had stifled all those feelings which he knew he had upon this occasion in favour of substantial justice, and to insist on the dry letter of the law? It certainly must be his superior sense of duty to support the regularity of the proceedings of that House. But why had he not told these petitioners of this informality sooner? If he had said at the time of presenting this petition, that the petition could not have been received, because the words were not in it which the hon. gent. contended the act required should have been in it, the petition might have been rejected without any hardship on the petitioners; so that the formality of the proceedings of the House would have been preserved, and substantial justice might have been done to the parties complaining at the same time, for then another petition might have been presented, and the words, now said to be wanting, might have been supplied. But what was the403consequence of being silent then and loud now, if the House should adopt this motion? That of placing the petitioners in a situation in which they could never have their complaint heard at all. The House would recollect that the parties were brought into this situation by the act of the House itself, in which the hon. gent. had acquiesced, as well as every other member. No objection was made to this petition when it was presented the last session. The petitioners would have been subject to a penalty of 200l. if they had not renewed it in this session, that was in other words, if the hon. gent. was right in his motion, there would have been a penalty of 200l. attaching on these petitioners, if they did not repeat the offence, that of renewing an irregular, illegal petition. It was said, that the spirit of theGrenville Bill, as well as the letter of if, required it should be stated in the petition, that the petitioners had a right to vote at tile election, which this petition did not; and, therefore, this petition ought now to be rejected. If that was so, he could not help remarking, there would be a great hardship on the petitioners, and that by the course which had been taken to bring forward this motion; and it would look very odd if, on the very day before the petition was to come on, and a Committee to be ballotted to try the merits of if, a gentleman could get up hi the House of Commons and persuade the House that the petition, on account of its informality, could not be heard at all. Besides this, if the order for taking this petition into consideration, was discharged, it would appear strange upon the Journals, for the informality of the petition would not appear upon the Journals; ail that would appear there would be, that the petition had been presented in one session of parliament, and ordered to be taken info consideration on a given day, that the same petition was renewed in another session, according to the rules of the House, and that on the day before it was to have been taken into consideration, it had been rejected. No reason for its rejection would appear at all. Nothing would be seen to govern the future proceedings of the House by way of precedent, but, merely, that the House had received a petition in one session, made an order for taking it into consideration on a given day in another session, and had, on the day before the time for taking it into consideration, rejected that petition; a precedent which he thought would be dangerous. As to the wording of the act of parliament, if the act of parlia-404ment had set down the precise words to be used in such a petition, and they had not been inserted, the argument would have been invincible; but the act of parliament did not so provide, and the hon gent. did not say so, he only insisted that the petitioners must state themselves in such a way, as to shew that they had, or claimed to have, a right to vote at the election of which they complained. There being no form of words pointed out by the act, what were the petitioners to do? They naturally thought they should do that which others did before them. He could not conceive what could be the use of a precedent, if a poor ignorant man was not to be guided by it in drawing his petition in such a case as this; and, more especially, if that was a precedent received and adopted by the House immediately after the passing of the bill, and followed up by several others, without any objection, for thirteen years together.&#x2014;Now, as to the substance of the petition, it appeared to him to be sufficient. The petitioners called themselves \"Freeholders of the County;\" from that the obvious inference was, that as such they claimed the right of voting at the election of which they complained. Would it not then, on a mere dry technical objection, be hard to shut the door against them? By rejecting this petition now, there would be great and manifest injustice. By receiving it, there would be no injustice whatever to any one human being for all that could be done by the House, by entertaining this petition, would be to give it a hearing. His mind was satisfied that the substance of this act of parliament had been complied with in this petition. As to that part of the object of the act which was stated by the hon. gent. namely, that of preventing strangers from presenting petitions against the elections of members of parliament, he thought tint the best remedy for that was the provision of the act which made them pay costs. They stated themselves not to be strangers, but that they were freeholders of the county of Middlesex; upon which the only doubt that could be entertained was, whether they were not persons who had become freeholders since? That was matter for the inquiry of a Committee. The general current of petitions; I was, that the petitioners were electors, and it might be said that they were minors then, but that they had become electors since; but that would be matter for the investigation of the Committee. But he should have; thought, that the hon. gent. who had brought forward this motion, would have said, that he suspected the persons who had405signed this petition were not freeholders, but, on the contrary, he had stated, that he hid no doubt they were freeholders; and the act of the House had decided, it thought they were, by receiving the petition. He was, indeed, confident, that the hon. gent. who made this motion would be desirous if he succeeded in it, to have some legislative provision, for the purpose of allowing these petitioners a hearing; for, really, if this petition was informal, it was the fault of the House that the parties could not be heard upon it, for the petitioners had stated it in the common form the House had been accustomed to receive it, that they were freeholders of Middlesex, and, whatever difficulty there was in receiving the petition under the authority of the act of parliament, the House did not tell them of it while it Was in their power to correct the error. Now he asked for no legislative provision, for the purpose of hearing these petitioners, for he had not the least hesitation in giving his negative to the motion of the hon. gent. and, in so doing, he should give a conscientious vote, for sending this matter to a committee, in order that the merits of it may be tried.", "author_id": "/people/mr-george-tierney", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1804", "feb", "02"], "content": "said, he felt himself hound to vote for the affirmative of the question now before the House; and it did appear to him to be a question of infinite importance, and much beyond the point of the merits of the case. The House was now hitting in its judicial, and not in its legislative character. That House, although a supreme court of judicature, was as much bound, by the law of the land, as she meanest court in the land, and indeed it was more dangerous for such a high court to do any thing contrary to law; than any other court, on account of the example of it. Now, considering this question as a lawyer, he could not say there was much doubt upon it. He was sorry, indeed, that the objection had occured, for it might deprive the freeholders of the county of Middlesex of redress in this case; but whatever right they might have, and however they might he infringed upon with impunity, it was better to surfer that inconvenience and adhere to the general rules of law, whatever might be the effect of such rules in a particular instance, than to bend such rules to suit the rule to any motion, real or imaginary, of she substantial justice of any particular case. A great deal had been said on the equitable construction which ought to be put upon this statute. He did not assent to this doctrine, for he conceived that all acts of parliament should be construed with406strictness by that court which was to judge of its own power as it was derived under such acts. He had heard it said, that nothing which was done by Parliament could be undone by any power but that of Parliament, and Parliament might be induced to do something in this very case if the petition should be rejected: but that had nothing to do with the present question; and, as to an equitable construction of an act of parliament, especially when proposed to that House in judging of its own power under it, he objected to the principle altogether, because equitable constructions were very vague in their nature, and what appeared equitable to one man might appear quite unjust to another, and therefore it would be extremely dangerous to construe acts of parliament upon the vague notions of equitable construction, on the determinations of the House, upon questions relating to the extent of its own power. As to what had; been said on the subject of precedents, he did not assent to it, for they appeared not to have been in force more than sixteen years, nor were they uniform, for there might be twenty instances, even in that time, of petitions being different from those which had been quoted. He had looked into many upon this subject lately, and the result of his research entitled him to say this upon the current of precedents upon this subject. He agreed it was not necessary that the petition should state, in express terms, that they had or claimed the right of voting at the election of which they complained; but then he insisted on it, that it must be collected from the petition somewhere, that the petitioners either had, or claimed to have, a right to vote at the election of which they complained, otherwise mere strangers might complain as well as electors, a grievance which the legislature intended to prevent. Precedents were well enough to be resorted to, if the act of parliament was dark, or obscure; in such a case it would be well enough to look to former decisions; but if the act of parliament was clear, whatever number of precedents; there might be, they could be of no force against the meaning of such an act, for that would be to set up the judicial authority of t that House against the authority of an act of parliament, that was allowing one branch of the legislative power to annul the solemn act of the whole.&#x2014;Now, he said, it was impossible to look at this act of parliament without seeing that there was but one construction to be put upon it. The act of parliament gave the House directions 10 decide whether a petition complaining of an407undue election or return should be committed or not, and it stated what such a petition shall contain, and without which the petition should not be sent to a Committee, for it said that no proceeding shall be had on a petition&#x2014;not that it shall not be decided upon, but that no proceeding can be had on it unless there be said there in, that the persons who complained were persons who claimed a right to vote at the election: and it was impossible to set up the practice of the House against an act of parliament. Looking at the preamble of the bill which governed this case, if was easy to see what was the inconvenience which the act stated it to be the object of the act to avoid, it stated, that frivolous petitions were presented by those who had no right, &c;, and to prevent that practice, it was enacted, That no petition shock be proceeded upon, unless the persons presenting it has an interest in the event of the election, it therefore appeared to him to be quite impossible to entertain a petition, which did not state that interest in the petitioners at the Shoe of the election. It was said, that the. House had drawn the party into this difficulty by receiving; the petition in this session. He did net feel the force of that observation; as well might it be said that a court of justice had drawn a suitor into a difficulty, by permitting his suit to be. carried on perhaps for twelvemonth, and finally deciding, after objection taken arid argument upon the question, that the case did not come within the jurisdiction of the court. There were individual sacrifices that were indeed to be lamented when they happened, but they must be made for the preservation of the consistency of the law But it appeared to him, that these parties were, not without redress in this case, for there was no act of Parliament which limited the times of presenting an election petition; there was only a resolution of the House to that effect. It was easy or for the House to get rid of that resolution, as it applied to this case, and to say, that the parties shall have leave now to present another petition, which might be done immediately, conformably to the provisions of the act of Parliament. There was no difficulty for the House to dispense with it's own resolution in this particular, and so do away at once the hardship of the case&#x2014;a thing which had been done very often in order to avoid an extreme hardship in other eases, and the House had a right to make its own rules subservient to justice at any time.&#x2014;That would be removing all doubt. upon the subject; bur if the Hour's had no jurisdiction in ibis case to entertain this pention, as he conceived it had not, then it would be408in vain to send the petition to a committee, because the committee, which was but an emanation of the House, could not have any authority delegated from the House more than the House possessed, and therefore the decision of the committee could not be binding This would be die necessary consequence of following the course proposed by those who wished to send this petition to a committee.

The Legislature had there clearly and explicitly prescribed and laid down to the House, how they were to act, and had invested them with no discretionary powers whatever.&#x2014;Another hon. and learned gent, had admitted the necessity of some statement, similar to that pointed out in the act, being contained in the petition, but how did he get quit of this? By saying, let it go to the Committee, and be there decided. The legislature, however, had drawn a clear line of distinction between the duties or that House and of the Committee. To the House it had said, \"You shall not proceed on any petition in which the petitioners do not claim a right to vote at the election against415which they petition.\" To the Committee it had said, \"You shall decide on what shall be sent to you by the House,\" The learned gen. (Attorney General) had characterised the omission as one which might be corrected by a \"dash of the pen.\" This, however was no answer. There were no omissions or flaws, which a greater or smaller \"dash of the pen\" might not on the same principle supply and retify. The act clearly pointed out to the House what must he stated to them, before they could proceed in such petitions. Had the petitioners in the present case used words; to express such a meaning? No. They had not even stated that they were-aggrieved. \"Oh\" but says an hon. gent. \"if they had not been aggrieved upon what principle can we presume that they would have petitioned?\" The act, however, declared, that let their grievances be ever so great, if not described in a particular way, they were not entitled to be heard on them in that House. The decision of the Carmarthen Committee had been referred to, but as he was not acquainted with the grounds of it, he should not express an opinion upon it. he would, however, ask, would that Committee have presumed to find the petition frivolous and vexatious? Had they done so, what would have been the answer of the petitioners? We never pretended to have any right to vote at this election We felt ourselves aggrieved indeed as Englishmen, as electors of Middlesex, as electors even of Carmarthen, though not at the time of the. election, but we have never in our petition stated any claim to a title to vote at the election petitioned against.\" This clearly would be a satisfactory answer. The House was unwarranted in entertaining the petition even for a moment. It had been objected that he had not made his motion in suficient time. He wished he had attended to the objection at the time, and he would most unquestionably have made it. The charge, however, equally applied to every other member of the House. The argument of the hon. gent, was, \"You have missed your time, and cannot now take the matter into consideration.\" Such language might do extremely well among parties. If it were the business of the sitting member to make the objection, this might have been an exceedingly good answer. When made to Parliament, however, it was completely inapplicable. They were called on to consider whether they discharged their duty, if they set aside an act of Parliament merely for the convenience of persons who had neglected lo comply with its enactments. What416else were they doing in the present instance? He would defy the best judge of the interpretation of the English language, to point out words more clearly, more imperative and commanding, than those on which his motion was founded. An hon. gent, had charged him with not having even said that he did not believe that the petitioners were not freeholders of Middlesex. He really thought the hon. gent, not serious, when he made this remark. What had the House to do I with the fact, whether they were freeholders or Dot? They had no title to inquire into it. Had the petition been signed by Susan and Mary, and a number of names, not one of which, it was evident, could be freeholders or electors, still they were bound to receive the petition, if it described the petitioners in the manner provided by the act. It had been so found for him in a petition I presented by the electors of Westminster. In God's name, what could be done under this act, but discharge the petition? The petitioners had not even by inuendo insinuated that they had a right to vote. A person might present a petition saying he was a householder, a freeman, or any other term which he chose to adopt, but it must be impossible for the House to know that such title gave him a right to vote in any particular place for a member of Parliament. If he had stated: himself to be an inhabitant, would that hare been thought sufficient? Would the House have gone into a question of law, and heard evidence, for the purpose of establishing such a point? The idea was ridiculous; but it must follow, if the enactment of the statute be not adhered to, which requires the petitioners explicitly to describe themselves as having a claim to the right of voting. He regretted that a noble lord who had been much engaged in election committees (Lord Gienbervie) was not in his place, that the House might have heard his opinion on the subject. If the House negatived his motion he should feel it his duty to apply for appeal of the act, that they might not have petitions flying in the face of for every day. At to the regret so pathetically expressed by gentlemen, that the petitioners should lose the opportunity of vindicating their rights merely from an accidental circumstance, that had received a very satisfactory answer from the learned Serjeant under the gallery, who had pointed out to them how frequently such foreclosures occurred in a court of justice. Notwithstanding the doubt which almost every gentleman had expressed on the subject, he must again declare his conviction, that not the most distant degree of417ambignity was perceptible to him on the most minute investigation of the act. As to the form, he had no objection to have the question put in the manner suggested by his hon. friend (Air. Sheridan). The hardship which agreeing to the motion would throw on the people of England, he could not conceive. He had been told that Ids motion did not deserve favour it asked none. Were gentlemen to enter into the argument, they would find, that, however harsh the maxim it would still prevail thatignornntia legis non excusat.He then proposed to have the question put as suggested by Mr. Sheridan, when&#x2014;", "author_id": "/people/mr-charles-fox-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

Nothing certainly could be greater than the importance of this measure, not only as affecting Ireland, but because it shewed what must be the consequence in this country, if the restriction should continue to any great length of time. If he had sat silent upon this occasion, it might be supposed that his opinion had been altered by the discussion which took place on the second reading; but although he paid every attention to the arguments which were used on that occasion, his sentiments still remained unchanged. It had been most clearly proved, that there was a great depreciation in the value of paper in Ireland, and that specie could only be procured with great difficulty and at a large premium: it had been urged, that the scarcity of guineas arose rather from factitious than from real causes; this be was inclined not to believe, for it was surely more probable that paper should be depreciated, from so great a quantity having been issued, than that the price of gold should have risen so much beyond its real value. Before he sat down, he wished to mention one or two points to which he hoped he should receive an answer, or at least some explanation from the right hon. gent. opposite him (Mr. Corry.) The rate of exchange had been for some time past increasing against Ireland, and had risen so high as 19&#x00BD; per cent. Notwithstanding this, it had been asserted, that the Bank of Ireland last year had given a bonus of 5 per cent, to the proprietors of bank stock: this was a subject which certainly required some explanation. There was another circumstance which he had heard, from authority on which he placed494great reliance, but which he wished at the same time to state with the greatest diffidence. The circumstance to which he alluded was this, that although the exchange was so great against Ireland, yet that the Lords of the Irish Treasury received their salaries at par. He had before stated, that he did not mean to assert this positively as a fact, but he thought it right to mention it, to give the right hon. gent. opposite to him an opportunity either of contradicting or explaining it, because, if those who might be supposed to have the greatest means of adopting measures for preventing the balance from being so strongly against Ireland felt no inconvenience from it, it might be apprehended that they would not feel much anxiety on the subject. That these evils existed, and that they required remedy, had not been denied, and, therefore, he hoped that some measures would be resorted to; the one that appeared to him the most proper would be to appoint a committee to inquire into the cause of the high state of exchange against Ireland. He lamented that he himself could, not move for such a committee, because there was another inquiry which the Chancellor of the Exchequer had expressed his intention of moving for, respecting the Duty on Malt in Scotland, to which he felt himself bound to devote a great part of his attention; but he hoped it would be taken up by a right hon. gent.

At present, however, he wished to state, that certain officers from Ireland, who were employed in this country in the discharge of their public duty, were paid their salaries at par; that the Treasury of Ireland having money in this country, had given orders for the payment of those who were officially employed in this, country, including himself, the Lords of the Treasury, and the inferior officers, who were obliged to attend here during the session of Parliament, in the manner that had been stated. This practice had originated with the Union, and had been continued since, without any observation having been made upon it. With regard to what the noble lord495had stated respecting the depreciation of paper in Ireland, he had given his opinion upon that subject, not only on the last discussion on this bill, but in the course of last session. It would be remembered that he had the honour of proposing a bill last session, which met with the approbation of the House, the object of which was, to restrain the circulation of small notes in Ireland, which bill was to commence its operation from the 1st day of this year. Finding, however, at the commencement of the present session, that the members from that part of the United Kingdom could not, in consequence of their military duties attend in Parliament, he had proposed a bill to postpone the operation of that measure till July, in the hopes that before that time he lush members would be enabled to attend in their places, and that the subject might be discussed in the most ample manner. The noble lord and the House would therefore, he hoped, do him the to acknowledge, that upon this subject he had always entertained and professed the same opinion. As to the question of the Restriction on the Bank of Ireland, he supposed the noble lord did not mean to contend that the Restriction ought to be taken of there while it continued here.&#x2014;[Lord A.

But he did not agree with those, gentlemen, who attributed the balance of exchange against Ireland entirely to the restriction on the Bank of Ireland. If they would look back to the years 1795 and 1796, they would had that the exchange was very high against Ireland, although there was then no restriction on payment in specie. The cause of this balance would perhaps be more readily found in the situation of the trade of Ireland with this country. Gentleman forgot when they spoke upon this subject, the large amount of the absentee rents drawn from Ireland. They forgot that since the union several large loans for that country had been negotiated in England, the interest of which, to the amount of one million and a hah, was annually drawn from Ireland. The absentee rents he estimated at little less than three millions, therefore the balance of trade in favour of Ireland must be great indeed, to supply such a continual drain. It had been said that the Bank of England had a greater controul over the private bankers than the Bank of Ireland had. This was a proposition he could not assent to, because the Bank of England had no other controul over the bankers except by refusing to discount their paper, and the Bank of Ireland had the same power. There was, however, a material difference between the situation of the two countries. In Ireland they had not only to combat with the general disposition of mankind to hoard specie, but there were in that country obvious causes which made that disposition almost universal. He did not speak of the North of Ireland, where fide was carried on almost all with specie, and the people had a confidence in each other, which, he was sorry to say, was not the case in the other provinces. The object of the lower classes of people in Ireland was to get specie, and the moment it was obtained it was buried, without the person so secreting it communicating it even to his wife or children, the consequence of this were, that immense quantities was lost. This disposition had produced the most fatal effects in Ireland. Tenants before they would pay their rents in specie would suffer themselves to be distrained and their cattle sold. They had no objection to pay in paper, because they497thought, in rise of a successful convulsion, it would be of no value. But long before the restriction on the Bank, there was a great scarcity of specie arising from its being hoarded. He hoped, therefore, when gentlemen were discussing these subjects; they would bear in mind the great difference between the two countries, and not suffer themselves to decide too hastily upon general principles.", "author_id": "/people/sir-simon-newport", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

He begged to have, it distinctly understood, that he was silent for the reasons only that he had given; namely, that he concurred in the recommendation of the hon. mover, and would reserve what he had to say to subsequent stages of the proceeding. Some of the topics of the right hon. gentleman were to Le sure, of a sort on which it did not seem that there was much to be said. When the right hon. gentleman laid down his laws of debating, having in view, he supposed, the well-known laws of philosophising, and declared that they were to proceed without heat, to abstain from every thing with, to consider every thing with coolness and impartiality, &c.; &c;,; and when, in like manner, he talked of those, who were enemies to the volunteers only because they were at the same time enemies to the constitution in church and state, he was at a loss to know what to say, because he did not very well know, what the observations meant, nor against whom they were intended to point. His history of the volunteer system, with its descent and progress from the time of the last administration to the present day, inasmuch, as itwasa mere history, and, he supposed, a correct one, was as little a subject on which he had any thing to remark.

The noble lord (Castlereagh) argued as if it was a breach of faith; for though he stated such a claim to be a violation of the military principle, and so far agreed with his right hon. colleague, yet much as he admired and loved that principle, he thought it good in some cases only to be departed from; for he insisted, that the Crown should most tenaciously keep faith with the volunteers upon this point. The right hon. See of State asserted the right of the Crown to dismiss any corps asserting such a privilege; and the noble lord, while he admitted the right of the Crown, insisted upon the necessity of relaxing it in this case. Upon which of those was the House to rest their confidence? or how was the House to accept a proposition, as adequate to its purposes, upon which his Majesty's ministers, sitting in council by each other, could not agree?", "author_id": "/people/mr-thomas-grenville", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

His Majesty was, by law, invested with the high privilege of commanding the exertions, and exacting the services of every one of his subjects; and this, his undoubted prerogative, seemed to be questioned, or at least rendered abortive by the general defence act; for in its consequences it tended to paralize the operation of that particular prerogative. He censured the principle of exemption, and the practice of extending those privileges to the great mass of the population of the country, which, by the former laws, were only claimable by persons under peculiar circumstances. The lamentable result of this principle, he might say of general exemption, was, that the recruiting service, whether for the army, or even tor the militia, was completely cut up both root and branch; and all the vigour and activity of the country were protected and locked up, as it were, from the defence of the empire, at the most momentous crisis in which it. was ever placed. Three fourths, at least, of the people, of such part of them as would have enrolled themselves in the militia, or enlisted into r-he army, were, by the ill-considered measure of the I lib of August, sheltered against that prerogative, almost coeval with the monarchy, of being required, in time of peril, to come forward in defence of their country. The hon. member called emphatically on his ministers and particularly on467the Secretary of State, to recover that high ground on which they stood previous to the 11th of August. He called on them to unfetter the hardy and gallant population of the country, and to subject very man, indiscriminately, to be required to contribute every exertion he was capable of to defend the constitution. He even wished to see the good old system revived as practised in the reign of Henry the Eighth, when the flower of the English youth was to be seen on the sabbath day exercising with the bow and arrow, and the other military weapons then in use. This was a duty to which they were compellable by particular statutes; and he could see no great impropriety at the present day, of compelling every man capable of bearing arms, of being trained to the exercise of the musket. Were such an wholesome and excellent practice revived, then, indeed, he should have no hesitation in saying, that the armed force of this empire would not only prove a terror to the French, but might bid defiance to the combined hostility of all Europe. He would not, at present, make any opposition to the motion of the right hon. Secretary, but resered to himself the privilege of arguing it fully and minutely hereafter. He, above all things, conjured the House not, by any acts of theirs, to lock up all the population (when he said all, he meant, the active portion of it) from serving in the militia and the army.&#x2014;The question was then put, and carried.

The House win perceive, that I allude to the much lamented indisposition of our beloved Sovereign. Ever since much the 14th of the present month, this House, in common with the public at large, have been in possession of the melancholy information that his Majesty has been confined by a dangerous and doubtful illness. It is rot my wish to enter, with any; degree of minuteness, into this most delicate and distressing subject; but I cannot help thinking, after the interval which has taken place, and after the reports of the physicians specially appointed to declare to the public the state of his Majesty's health for the last two days, that Parliament has a right to expect some explicit communication. I cannot but consider such a communication necessary, in order to remove those distressing doubts which his Majesty's much deplored indisposition has created in every part of the country. Sir, I have a right to assume to myself, that that illness is of the most severe nature; and in the reports submitted to the public, no satisfactory ground of hope is held out that it will come to a speedy termination. Some direct, explicit communication is loudly called for, and this, as a member of Parliament, I think it my duty to require of ministers. Upon the answer which I shall receive to these few observations on this most interesting subject, I shall be guided, either in grounding upon it a specific motion, or in moving that this House do now adjourn.", "author_id": "/people/sir-robert-lawley", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1804", "feb", "29"], "content": "said, I rise, Sir, not so much with an intention to oppose your leaving the chair, as to delay it. We have time enough to discuss the provisions of this bill, even if they were, what I do not think they are, very material or very urgent. Other objects, infinitely more important and more pressing, seem to me to demand a previous consideration. They are not unconnected with the general purpose of the bill. On the contrary, they are essentially connected with it. A measure of national defence is brought before us. To know whether it is judiciously contrived, and likely to answer the purpose it professes, you must consider what your danger is; to understand your danger, you must look at the situation of the country in all its circumstances and relations. This is not a mere question of military defence against a foreign for, but whether our situation, on the whole, constitutes a state of national security, or extreme peril? I speak with greater anxiety and concern on my mind than I ever experienced in this House, because I seriously feel the truth of what others say, without feeling it so deeply as they ought to do. At least it so appears to me to be too much the habit of this House, and indeed of the public. We talk of our danger in very proper terms that it is imminent that the crisis573is awful, terrible, and tremendous. Gentlemen use these phrases till they are hacknied and make no impression. We are not deficient in strong expressions about the case, but we are extremely cautious about what we say of the causes and the authors; as if all our duties were comprised in the personal prudence of not giving offence, lake care how you offend this or that great person; be guarded in your terms; be delicate in your allusions. And this they say at the approach of the greatest hazard, and with the prospect of the greatest calamities to the nation. I am not at all disposed to follow these prudential maxims. I will not make an apology or look out for a shelter for doing that which I think an essential duty, and which the present moment imperiously demands of me. This insignificant bill may wait till other topics are discussed. Not that I mean to go far into the discussion of them; but rather to suggest them to the consideration of some gentlemen who are better qualified, and have more authority to in force them. In order to make an effectual provision for what is to come, we must look back to what is past. You might as well say that you may have wisdom without experience, as to talk of remedies against an existing or an impending mischief, without reverting to the false steps which have brought you into it. I do not mean to argue now about the justice or injustice of the war, but shortly to compare the conduct and the progress of it, with the principle which it originally assumed, and the character it out with. In going to war for the preservation of a rock in the Mediterranean, of which we were in possession, we asserted a high station is the society of nations; we took the most eminent ground of national dignity, elevated pretensions, foreign dominion, and possibly of laudable ambition. No man thought or said that it was a war of domestic security, or for the mere defence of the two islands. What followed? This war of dignity and ambition had not been three months old, before a plan was delivered out by authority for defending the capital by lines of circumvallation! A more unmilitary idea, or more universally reprobated by all the great military authorities, did never enter into the mind of a rational government. But I do not now arraign it in that sense. I compare it with the high pretensions of the war, and then I say, that a more degrading act of national humiliation in the eyes of all Europe, cannot be imagined. What have we been doing ever since? Why, Sir, it is said that we have provided for the security574of Great-Britain and Ireland. Whether we have done so or not remains to be tried. But granting the fact, to what docs it amount to, but that with a garrison of near 600,000 men in arms, we are able to defend the two islands? There is our glory and there it ends. The war then on cur side, is purely and strictly defensive, and in all appearance it never can be any thing else. But what is 3 defensive war? What is a war in which you cannot offend your enemy? in which you must perpetually wait and watch his motions, and be. perfectly satisfied if you can parry his attacks? This was not the principle on which that wise personage Queen Elizabeth acted in parallel circumstances. Her language was, that \"having advised with herself, she was resolved either to make war or peace, forvia di mezzowas very unsafe; and besides a course of continual charge: continual fear and to stand only on the defensive was to live at the discretion of her enemies.\" Such was her wisdom, I or such were the counsels of the great men who advised her; of Raleigh, of Walsingham, of Burleigh, whose characters, I presume, will not suffer much by comparison with that of the gent, opposite to me. Bur I after all, have we fully provided even for our defence? That we have sufficient physical force, I do not dispute. But have we the directing mind? Another view of our state is indeed most melancholy, and open I to the most distressing consequences. Does; any man in the House know with certainty, or can he assert with confidence, that at this moment, when all the faculties of life country are most wanted, die constitution is in real and practical possession of its executive; power? The explanation? given by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, have thrown no light on that question. All we could collect from him was that he was better informed than other persons who ought to have known best.&#x2014;His Majesty's Secretary of State has declared, that strict faith must be kept with the several corps of volunteers, according to the terms of their respective compacts with government; and that, if any of them should persist in claiming a right to choose their officers, on which their engagements were offered and accepted, he shall hold himself bound to advise his Majesty to discontinue their service. In the first place, Sir, I do not think that it is I keeping faith with them. They have put themselves to great trouble and considerable expense, and many personal sacrifices for the public service; and now, if they do not submit to a new condition, which ought to I have been stated to them in the first instance575if they do not surrender a right or a claim, which they thought t had been acknowledged, they are to be invidiously turned adrift, as if they had deserted he defence of their country in its utmost danger. I am sure they when not do so, but it is their own virtue, and not the wisdom of government, that will pi event it. In my mind, Sir, their claim is inherent in the nature of the service they have engaged in. In this respect there is an essential difference between a voluntary and a mercenary army. I mean nothing invidious by that word. No man can respect and honour our regular and more them I do. In an army raised by the crown, and paid by the public, the appointment of the officers must be in the executive power, and can be no where else. The men who compose are unknown to one another until they are brought together; and could never agree to choosing their officers, even if the choice was left to their discretion. But the principle on which a voluntary army agreed to unite and act, is that they previously knew and depend upon each other. Their officers are their neighbours or acquaintances, and their colonel probably a man of the greatest rank and fortune, and most respected in the county. If this be wrong, it is a defect in the system, but I think it belongs to it. But, Sir, in what circumstances is it that his Majesty's ministers are so very ready to disband any part of that force, in which, hitherto, they have professed to rely fur the public defence? It is it the same moment when we hear it from them, and have it under the hand of the Sectary of State, \"that an immediate, and form table attack upon our independence and existence, as a nation, is threatened by a powerful and implacable enemy.\"&#x2014;Surely, Sir, these considerations deserve the attention of the greatest abilities, and of the most eminent persons in this House. To watch the conduct of government, to take care of the public safety is, at all time their special duty; but particularly now, when, unfortunately for the country, they have no oilier duly to perform.", "author_id": "/people/sir-philip-francis", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1804", "feb", "27"], "content": "was of opinion, that the bill was inadequate to the object which it professed to have in view, that it would not be productive of any real or lasting advantage, and that it would end in smoke. His right hon. friend (Mr. Pitt) had defended the system, principally on the ground that it was particularly necessary at the present moment, when, from the urgency of the case, no measure of equal advantage could be devised. This was, however, in his opinion, by no means a decisive mode of arguing. We were not called on merely to provide for the exigency of the present moment, but to consider what would be the species of force which would be adequate to our future defence. The danger against which we were called on to provide, was not one which must infallibly assail us at the present moment. We could not prescribe the conduct of the enemy who threatened us; nor could we know whether the majestic preparations which he was making were brought to full maturity, and would be ready to attack us tomorrow, or for twelve months to come. The enemy by whom we were at present menaced, was undoubtedly one which we were called on by every tie to repel; and to do so with effect, and certainty of success, the whole population of the country, he thought, ought to be employed,&#x2014;So far, therefore, he was an advocate for voluntary service; but he could not agree that the voluntary force to be employed ought to be of the nature contended for in the present bill. His right hon. friend had pointed out the danger of a sudden diminution of the volunteer establishment. He unquestionably did not wish that any precipitate step of that nature ought to be adopted. He agreed with his rt. hon. friend in thinking, that terror was not the mode of procuring a continuance of a voluntary offer of service, and, on that principle, he approved of the option given to volunteers to withdraw their services, as being the best means of encouraging their continuance. The conditions, however, with which that option was clogged were so unpalatable, that he was convinced the measure would not succeed, but that many would avail themselves of the option and withdraw. His great objection to the present volunteer system was the effect which it had in obstructing the recruiting for the army, which was only553Supplied through the medium of the army of reserve. He did not say that the volunteer system was in itself an obstruction to the re cruiting of the regular army, but that by the number of exemptions from serving in the militia and army of reserve, which it occasioned, the field was contracted, the bounties to substitutes were raised above all due proportion, and the difficulty of procuring recruits was rendered almost invincible. Thus, though it did not in itself pre vent recruiting, it did so by its con sequences. His right hon. friend had aid, that as the demand for substitutes became less, the bounties would also become less. He, however, apprehended, that it Mould be rather found, that as the demand became less the means of supplying that demand had become less in a greater proportion. By the difficulty of making up their ballots, and the expense attendant on the enormous bounties given, many parishes had been reduced to the greatest distress. Could he then say, that it was proper to continue the volunteer system under such disadvantages? Ought we alone to regard the present moment, and, through fear of lessening the present volunteer establishment, endanger our safety in succeeding years? He could not agree with his right hon. friend as to the inutility of a body of armed peasantry. He should only ask, if a body of 100O men of this description were collected, would an experienced officer think them of no use, because they had not been trained? He surely would not. He would employ them insomeway, and that way would be no other than loosely annoying the enemy. If they made little impression at first, experience would improve them. The practice of war would teach them the best mode of proceeding. Not having learnt the manoeuvres which are only to be acquired by exercise at drill, they would not be of the full service which might be expected from regular troops. Whatever service, however, was to be expected from them, it would be got in some degree from the first, and they would constantly improve. If they did no good, they would do no harm. If they were not able to cope with the enemy themselves, they would not set the example to others to run away.&#x2014;In the other way, if not brought to a certain degree of proficiency and military skill, if not trained to a certain extent, the volunteers, by mingling with the regular, would impede and confuse, rather than serve any useful purpose. The great error was in supposing, that army, militia, and volunteers were only different stages of the same thing that as554certain anatomists had thought that membrames in certain cases became cartileges, and cartileges became bones, so it seemed to be supposed, that volunteers would, by degrees, grow into militia, and militia in time harden into regular army.&#x2014;It was not sufficient to say, because an improper system had been gone into, that it ought to be persevered in; that they had got into a lane in which there was no turning, and therefore that it behoved them to go on. This was his objection to the ideas thrown out by his right hon. friend. If they continued the exemptions, with the other part of the system, they did so at the expense of counteracting the other part of the force of the country. It had been said, that a great many volunteers had entered as recruits. Of that he could entertain no doubt, nor was it possible to be otherwise where the whole population of the country were volunteers. With equal truth had it been asserted, that the Roman Catholics were the only disaffected persons in Ireland, in cases where the rebellion had broken out in a part of the country where none but Roman Catholics resided. The right hon. gent, then alluded to the conduct of the volunteers at Chester, who attacked the gaol, and liberated one of their companions. He did not mean to describe this as the most atrocious of all offences; nor would he fear to say that, however criminal the conduct, in the motives of these men might be discovered possibly even a degree of virtue. They might be impelled by a generous sentiment of rescuing a comrade unjustly carried away. But it was not thus that the law contemplated such proceedings, and, certainly, not the professors and administrators of the law, who were never backward on these occasions in thundering forth their horror and reprobation, and in repressing these acts ofvirtueorexcuseable irregularity,by a little punishment called hanging. It seemed pretty obvious, that ministers had erected a force of which they now stood in awe, when it was mentioned that the only excuse made for not punishing so flagrant an act was, that the perpetrators of it could not be found out. He declared his horror of unequal punishments, and contrasted the condition of these volunteers with that of the man who was hanged while he (Mr. Windham) was secretary at war, for destroying opposite, to the war-office, not a gaol, not a place of authorized confinement, known to the law, and placed immediately under the royal protection, where none could be put but for just cause and by regular process, but. a vile crimping-house?, the ap-555propriate seat of violence and abuse, against which every thing was to be presumed, and where the presumption could rarely exceed the reality of the fact.&#x2014;In other points of view, the volunteer system, as now eon-ducted, was seriously to be considered. On the occasion of a general election, for Instance, when corps might set up candidates of their own, or espouse the cause of one or oilier of those already declared; how was the rule to be applied of sending, during an election, armed mm out of the town? It would be, in fact, to send the town out of itself. To the plan of his right hon. friend he must decidedly object. It was enforced, as it was sure to be, with great eloquence and ingenuity but&#x2014;materiem superabit opus.The suggestions themselves were not the more judicious, because they were set forth with great ability. However he might wish to have the energy of the country displayed upon adequate occasions, he did not wish it to be rendered a military country. Even if that were the purpose, the way to accomplish it would not be to render every man a soldier. Those countries in which the system was pursued of making ail the citizens soldiers, were, in fact, the countries that were least military. France, Austria, Prussia, all the great military countries, pursued a totally different course. Swisserland, if in some sense a military country, was not military in virtue of its militia, but from the number of its inhabitants who had acquired experience in foreign service. Geneva, in which that was not the case, but in which every citizen was enrolled in the militia, was certainly not a military state: and the. same was eminently true at this moment of America. Ministers should seriously set about the great work under consideration, and atone for past neglect, by sedulously labouring to create an effective force, which could cooperate with, or support the regular force of the country, when the urgency of the occasion should require.", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-windham-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

{"date": ["1804", "feb", "27"], "content": "&#x2014;I feel, Sir, that the subject introduced to the attention of the House is one of the highest interest and the most sacred importance. It is very far from my wish, in the course of my observations, to fail in that delicacy which it so strongly suggests. But, Sir, I should feel that I was deficient in duty to this House, deficient in duly to his Majesty, deficient in duty to the principles of the constitution, if I could bring myself to acquiesce in the answer which the right hon. gent., who just sit down, has thought fit to submit to our consideration. It does not accord with my opinions, to attach so great a degree of delicacy to this discussion, as some persons may wish to inculcate. There does not appear any material obstacle in the way of fair, liberal discussion, and it is with such a view of the subject, that I am desirous of laying before the House, the reasons which induce me to think the answer of the right hon. gent. altogether unsatisfactory. It will not, I conceive, Sir, be denied, that hitherto the House and the Public, know nothing of the lamented indisposition of his Majesty, except through die medium of those daily Reports which have been published by official authority. By these alone can we be guided. On these alone can any opinion be formed. But, Sir, how has the right hon. gent. proceeded in attempting this evening to convey any thing like information to the House? He has told us, that it is the opinion of his Majesty's confidential servants that no communication is necessary&#x2014;that such a communication would be indecent&#x2014;that it could be made the ground of no subsequent proceeding. On this most extraordinary declaration I wish to call the attention of the House, not only to common practice, but to what is the strict letter and spirit of the constitution. I have to say, then, that I know of no such persons as the King's confidential servants. They are a body utterly unknown in any constitutional view of the subject. I know, indeed, of a body of individuals more particularly employed in the executive government, but in this capacity alone can they be recognized.509The right hon. gent. opposite is known to this House as the person holding the important situation of Chancellor of the Exchequer, and other gentlemen may be known as holding other offices in his Majesty's service, bat as to confidential servants of his Majesty, the fact is, they cannot be recognized, in a general point of view, they are nothing more than privy counsellors, and can claim no superior distinction. There is one, and only one point of distinction, and that is, the circumstance of their being more frequently called upon for their advice by the Sovereign. When any business of emergency occurs, and a council is to be held, they are more frequently called upon for their assistance, and that, Sir, is the only distinction betwixt them and the other members of his Majesty's privy council. It will not surely, however, be necessary to take up much of the time of the House, in shewing that this is a distinction inseparable from the regular daily exercise of all the royal functions. From the moment that the Sovereign, from illness or from any other cause, is rendered incapable of discharging the functions of royalty, those persons, described as confidential servants of the crown, are nothing more than ordinary privy counsellors. The source of their distinction is, for the time, destroyed, and it is ridiculous to talk of their continuing the exercise of powers expressly delegated from the chief magistrate in person. If any communication bad been made this evening from those styling themselves the confidential servants of his Majesty, I am sure, Sir, that such a communication would have been received with all the respect due to any message from so honourable a body of individuals, and any subsequent proceedings founded on such a communication must have been matter for very grave and important inquiry. But how does the House stand with respect to any communication at the present moment? Why, Sir, the whole is reduced to this simple point:&#x2014;The right hon. gent. over the way, has informed us that certain individuals, styling themselves his Majesty's confidential servants, of whom the House constitutionally know nothing, have felt it their duty to give no information on a subject deeply interesting, not to the members of this House alone, but to every loyal man throughout the empire. They tell us farther, that any communication of his sort would be productive of no good consequence, but that to require any information at present would be equally improper and indecent. It is not surely, Sir, at all unreasonable to ask, whether this opinion is founded on any knowledge of510the present state of his Majesty's health, and the prospect of a speedy recovery? But here the right hon. gent. will not condescend to gratify the House with a single tittle of information. His answer is, that in the opinion of his Majesty's confidential servants, there is no occasion for any communication, and in this assurance Parliament is to confide. Now, how does the public information, respecting the Sovereign's health, stand? Has that information, which must be so gratifying to every loyal heart, been communicated, that the period of his Majesty's recovery may be expected to be near at hand? Have government communicated any thing at all like this to the House? Have they said a single word as to the probable duration of his Majesty's illness, and his ability to resume the ordinary functions of royalty? On these points they have left the House in a state of total darkness. If they had made any communication to the House, then it would have been for Parliament to determine whether a longer pause might not be allowed, without resorting to any extraordinary measures. On the other hand, if the communication had not been of so satisfactory a nature, the House, in the exercise of its constitutional privileges, would have been called upon to deliberate as to the steps proper to be adopted, and to decide whether those steps should be such as were applicable to a contingent event, or directed to an immediate evil. These, Sir, are my general views as to the imperious necessity of a communication on so very interesting a subject. After the communication had been made, it would then have remained with us to determine, what time was to elapse before it was made the ground of any subsequent proceedings, and before the nature of these proceedings is folly ascertained. If any argument were wanting to prove the expediency of an immediate communication to Parliament, in my opinion the official reports of his Majesty's health for the two last days would be fully sufficient to demonstrate it. It is very clear from these reports, that the speedy recovery of his Majesty is not to be reasonably expected. Yesterday the report was gratifying, so far as this, that an assurance of his Majesty's recovery from the illness with which he has been afflicted, was held forth, but it was, at the same time, accompanied with the declaration of the physicians, that a rapid amendment could not be expected. To day the report was, that his Majesty was still better than he was yesterday, and that he was gradually approaching to recovery. There is, to he sure, Sir, in these reports, much to gratify every Royal511neart; but though we may now hone that his Majesty is out of danger, we have no ground for believing, that he will speedily be enabled to resume the functions of royally. In the one report we are told, that a rapid recovery cannot be expected; and, in the other, that he is gradually approaching to recovery. The terms are clearly contradistinguished to each other; and, if language has any meaning, the assertion I have new made is fully established. All loyal subjects are happy to have such good accounts of the health of their Sovereign; but as it is now declared that his recovery must be gradual, the question of the expediency of some communication on the subject to the House becomes more apparent. It is not at all my wish, on the present occasion, to anticipate what decision the House may come to after a communication is made; but I must protest against the doctrine, that certain persons, styling themselves his Majesty's confidential servants, should take on themselves the right of determining when a communication to Parliament should be brought forward. For any individuals, whatever situation under government they hold, whether appearing as Chancellor of the Exchequer, or as Secretaries of State, to assume to themselves the right of judging when an undoubted privilege of Parliament is to be exercised, is assuming a power which no former ministers have ever done in any period of our history. I have already said, Sir, that it is not my wish to anticipate any future discussion. I may, however, be permitted to allude to one fact, which is certainly of very considerable importance. As early, I believe, as the beginning of February, a circular letter was sent to the lord lieutenants of the several counties of the kingdom, announcing that a formidable and immediate attempt at invasion was expected by government. I believe, Sir, if such an opinion was entertained by government at that time, no circumstances have since reached them which can at all decrease their apprehensions of dinger. Since the period alluded to, there have, on the contrary, been reports which still more strongly countenance the idea of an immediate attack of the enemy, and believe it is now the opinion of many persons, that the enemy are only waiting the favorable moment to carry their threats into execution. Under such circumstances, I would call on ministers to consider, what would be the consequence of the suspension of the royal functions, if the enemy should, at such a crisis, succeed in landing on our shores? Before the volunteers could be called into action, it would be512necessary to subject them to martial-law; I but how is this to be effected, if there is no I power in the state to issue the requisite proclamation? It is impossible for any gentleman to determine at what time the atttempt; of the enemy may be made. Even before we have left the place in which we are now assembled, intelligence of a landing may be received. Let me put it, Sir, to the right honourable gentleman, and to the House, in what situation the country would be placed, it, at the moment of invasion, the executive, authority was totally suspended? If even under any circumstances invasion would be formidable, it is needless to expatiate on the increase of this danger under circumstances such as those now alluded to. But, Sir, there are other points of a constitutional nature, which loudly call for the adoption of some measure, to supply the place of the temporary suspension of the royal functions. These are not points of small import, but, on the contrary, highly worthy of consideration. As a supporter and admirer of the constitution, I am desirous of seeing all its branches properly balanced. Let me ask then, whether it is not consonant, as well to the letter, as to the spirit of the constitution, that the executive authority should keep up a due influence over the legislative power? It is the undoubted prerogative of the Sovereign to preserve a certain degree of control over the legislature, as it is of the legislature to watch over the proceedings of the executive part of the constitution. Of these powers of the Sovereign, there is none more clear than his right of proroguing or dissolving Parliament, even at rive minutes notice. If this is s: clear principle of the constitution, I should be glad to know how this control is to be exercised, and it ought to be constantly and actively employed, in the tota labsence of the exercise of the royal functions? The right honourable gentleman has informed the House, that his Majesty's confidential servants do not think any communication necessary, How far it may or may not be necessary, is not a point for them to decide. This decision is the exclusive right of Parliament, I am really utterly at a loss to know on what principle this extraordinary confidence is called for&#x2014;on what ground it is that they require the House to make them the judges, when the real state of the health of the Sovereign is to be laid before the legislature.&#x2014;By what claim are they to decide as to the time of making a communication so interesting to all orders of the community? There is no book, there is no practice, there is no principle to justify the plea set up, of constituting the Kings ministers, after the func-513tions of royalty have been suspended, the persons do determine what is most conducive to the public safety. Perhaps, Sir, I may hear a great deal of the responsibility which will attach to ministers. In no case could I consent to vest any set of men with extraordinary powers, from any promises of responsibility. But, more especially n capes where the most important interests of the state are involved, I should be particularly Jealous of conferring such powers. At a period when the very existence of the empire is at stake, it would be but a poor consolation to think that those who brought it to destruction were responsible for their errors and their crimes. When we see this reluctance on the part of ministers to communicate information, we are inclined to inquire, when the period will come when such a communication will be produced. Already a fortnight has elapsed, during which the functions of royalty have been confessedly suspended Another fortnight may elapse, and the House may remain as uninformed on the subject of the indisposition of the Sovereign, as at the present moment. In the first instance, no satisfactory information was afforded, and in the oilier case information might be with-held on equally solid grounds. What I require is, that the two Houses of Parliament should be apprised of the actual state of his Majesty's health, and thus be enabled to form an opinion of the steps necessary to be adopted for the public interest. At present no information has been given, and no grounds exist on which any grave deliberation can take place. It is impossible, Sir, to ascertain what is the limit to which the confidence required by ministers is to be carried. The system of blindfold, implicit confidence may go on from, day to day. The executive power, at all times necessary, but more peculiarly requisite at a moment of the greatest national peril, may continue to be suspended. What adds to the danger arising from this system is, that the danger which menaces the country is one which is repeated from day to day. No gentleman can pretend to fix the period when the great crisis may arrive, but government ought to have the best information, as on them this responsibility must rest. But, whatever may be the conduct of ministers, let not this House be deficient in their duty. Let us shew that we are impressed with suitable views of the whole circumstances of the empire, and that nothing on our part shall be wanting to contribute to its general honour, independence, and safety.", "author_id": "/people/mr-charles-fox-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1804", "feb", "27"], "content": "I rise, Sir, to submit a few observations to the House, in consequence of what has fallen from different gentlemen in the course of this most interesting discussion. My right honourable friend who has just sat down, has argued this question, as if the adjournment proposed by the motion, was meant to take place for some time, and to suspend the Junctions of Parliament; but, assuredly, that is not the intention of the honourable baronet who made the motion; if it was, I certainly could not give it my support. The motion merely means, as I understand it, tin adjournment for this day.&#x2014;Before, Sir, I proceed any further, I beg to return my thanks to the honourable baronet, who brought forward the present question. In making the motion which he has submitted to the House, he has performed a duty incumbent on every member of the House, but one which I am sorry to say, many of us would not have possessed sufficient fortitude to perform. For my own part, I am free to declare, that I should have left the House sorrowful and dejected, if the subject which522the honourable baronet has brought under discussion had escaped animadversion.&#x2014;In answer to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, I have to observe, that I have often, in the course of my parliamentary life, heard discussions about confidence, and have myself often argued upon the necessity of reposing a reasonable degree of confidence in ministers, but never did I hear it argued for, to the extent that it has been argued for this night by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The whole substance of his argument amounted to this: \"Here we are, his Majesty's confidential servants; we are in full possession of circumstances, but we will mike no communication, however urgent the crisis may be, and we claim responsibility. We call upon yon, the Parliament of England, to trust blindfolded to us, without any other security than our own responsibility.\" Now, without meaning, Sir, any thing disrespectful or harsh to his Majesty's ministers, this is a confidence which, in my opinion, ought not to be reposed in any ministers. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has asked: \"Upon every temporary illness to which his Majesty may be subject, will you go to the length of maintaining that it is necessary to apply for the interference of Parliament?\" If I were bound to answer that question in strict conformity to the principle of the constitution, my answer would be, \"yes.\" But it is very well known that general theories always admit of some mitigation, and, in certain cases, Parliament may connive at a short neglect of its dunes, but upon such a point there must exist some limitation,: but how is Parliament to ascertain what is the proper point of limitation, if, as in the present instance, they are deprived of all regular information? All the satisfaction that Parliament can obtain from his Majesty's ministers is this; \"We know our duty, we act upon our responsibility, and therefore you, the Commons of England, must wait till we tell you that it is right and tit you should interfere.\" Against a doctrine so outrageous, so dangerous, and so unconstitutional, I do most solemnly protest. There never was, I will maintain, a doctrine so outrageous of all principle, and so pregnant with the most serious mischiefs.&#x2014;It is one that has never before been advanced that whenever the Sovereign ceases from whatever cause, to have his regular control, the confidential servants of the crown are to carry on the government as long as they please, or until circumstances require an actual exercise of the royal authority. If you once admit the principle, it is impossible to say how long the country may be kept without an executive government. We have523seen that ministers have, for a fortnight, suffered the functions of royalty to be suspended, and even now they think no communication necessary. How are we to know how long this system is to be continued? I really see no reason why, upon the principle now laid down, it may not be kept so for six months. My light honourable friend (Mr. Pitt) does not, indeed, go to the same length as the Chancellor of the Exchequer: he has displayed his usual judgment upon this question; but still I cannot concur with him in opinion, that the moment (though he admits it to be near) is not yet come in which the interference of Parliament is necessary. This is the real question before the House. Is the period arrived, or is it not, when Parliament can no longer trust to his Majesty's confidential servants? Let us consider in what manner and by what circumstances the present moment is distinguished from those which have preceded it? And whether, if we do not interfere now, there is any thing to make us interfere afterwards, except the lapse of time, which, as my right hon. friend has said, we must count upon this most interesting subject by days and by hours.&#x2014;There are, let me remind the House, two moments to be kept in view, the moment of inquiry and the moment of proceeding. This question has been argued, as if the consequence of a communication to Parliament must be the immediate adoption of some measure to supply the deficiency of the executive government. But this is not the case. We do not call for any parliamentary proceeding, but for an inquiry: and upon the result of that inquiry it would depend, whether any further proceeding were necessary or not.&#x2014;Now, Sir, the reports respecting the state of his Majesty's health are those only on which we can place any reliance; yet, what is very extraordinary, the Chancellor of the Exchequer tells us, we are not to be guided by these reports. He not only says, you are to rely on me in preference, nay in opposition to the physicians, but he goes still farther, and tells you what the physicians mean to say. He is determined not only to declare against their opinions, but he is resolved, that they shall not be permitted to put their own meaning on their own words. The physicians say, that his Majesty's recovery can only be gradual; but the fact, says the hon. gentleman, is not so. \"The physicians did, to be sure, put such language into the report; but it was not thus that their meaning is to be understood. They only used this language to quiet the popular anxiety, and to put an end to ru-524mours out of doors; but I can give you certain information, that the report of the physicians is quite short of the truth, and that his Majesty is, at this moment, fully adequate to the functions of Royalty.\" Surely, Sir, this is to take a most unwarrantable liberty, both with the characters of the physicians who are described to have acted thus, and with the duties and dignity of the House to whom such a representation is addressed. To ascertain what these duties are, let us see what is the fact. It is now about fourteen days, since the House and the country received the alarming and afflicting notification, of the King's indisposition. The very notification proved that the illness could not be of a very slight or transient nature; and, undoubtedly, the general opinion was, that the illness, whatever was its kind, was in degree such as prevented for the time, the exercise of the Royal functions. The House decidedly acted upon this persuasion, having, by a sort of general agreement, than which nothing could be more proper nor more decorous, and in which the ministers had their full share, suspended all business that was not of a mere private or formal nature. What information has the House received upon the subject since that time?&#x2014;the report of yesterday which precludes the hope of a rapid amendment. The facts thus stated, constitute the true description of the situation of the country. We know, by authority that his Majesty is ill: we believe his illness to extend to the degree that I have described; and we are now told that a rapid recovery from this illness is not to be expected. The country is, therefore, in a most alarming state, and upon the principle now laid down, it may continue in that state for any indefinite time longer. The House, in cases of this sort, may, for a while, dissemble its feelings; it may, for a while, turn away from its situation, and shut its ears to the call of duty; but can we go on in this way, when the knowledge of our situation is forced upon us, when we can no longer disguise to ourselves the facts, or deny the duty which those facts necessarily give rise to? I certainly hope that the physicians may turn out to be mistaken in their opinion; it is very possible that it may be so; but still that opinion is the only authority the House can act upon. I do not know, nor could the physicians themselves say with precision, what period they had in view, when they said a rapid recovery was not to be expected; but they certainly meant to acquaint the public that they were not to flatter themselves with the hope that his Majesty's restoration to525health could be immediate. Can Parliament, with this knowledge before them, go on proceeding upon business as if nothing had happened? Can we, with propriety, go on at all? At all events, it appears to me that all business ought to be suspended, but that which is immediately necessary. With regard to the bill now before the House, no man can say that it is immediately necessary, though I agree with my right hon. friend, that the discussions connected with it are of the utmost importance. With the opinions entertain upon this subject, I certainly do not wish to have the discussion unnecessarily postponed, but it is singular, that ministers should now be so anxious to press forward the discussion, after they have postponed all public business for a fortnight. It is rather singular to observe the time at which they now call upon the House to proceed upon business; it is exactly the day after the physicians have! declared, that they did not entertain hopes of a rapid amendment in his Majesty's health. I again beg to repeat the question, at what period do ministers think that the House ought to interfere, or is it meant that Parliament should go on blind-folded, until those who have been chosen his Majesty's confidential ministers think fit to make a communication? I cannot reconcile this to any principle of the constitution, to the practice of Parliament, to any regard for the interests and safety of the Monarchy, or to any well-founded consideration of the interests and feelings of the Sovereign himself.&#x2014;In what fell from the Chancellor of the Exchequer a little word \"indecency\" slipt in, upon which I cannot avoid making a few observations. That right hon. gentleman has spoken of the indecency of these discussions. I beg leave to say, that I have as just a sense and as deep a feeling of what is due to his Majesty's personal character and feelings as the honourable gentleman or any of his Majesty's ministers. In constitutional attachment to the Sovereign all loyal men must be presumed to be equal. It is saying little, therefore, to say that, in that respect, I shall not allow myself to be outdone by the honourable gentleman; but I shall as little allow myself to be outdone by the honourable gentleman, or any one else in that further sense of personal respect and attachment which may be felt by those who may have enjoyed, more or less, the honour of being admitted to his presence, who may have? witnessed more nearly his private virtues and his domestic happiness, and have received in various degrees marks of his royal condescension and favour. On no one of these grounds will I yield to any of his Majesty's526confidential servants, nor allow that such feelings are in the smallest degree, called in question, by any thing that has been said by me or others on the present occasion. On the contrary, I do think it highly indecent in ministers to insinuate, that any measure proposed to be adopted for the benefit of the state, for the safety of the monarchy, and consequently for the service of his Majesty, is or can be in contradiction with the royal feelings. There is no ground for any remark of this sort. If Parliament did not, in the circumstances in which we are placed, call for further information, after so long a period has elapsed, after the information it has received from the physicians, it would, in my opinion, abandon its duty and disgrace its character, and I should have retired this night from the House with a mind dejected and sorrowful, if no member had made this inquiry, and if this discussion had not taken place.", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-windham-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

The effect of the motion has been to procure much informa-527tion. which would not have been given if the hon. baronet had not required it. If I understood the right hon. gent. (the Chancellor of the Exchequer) right, he stated that if any emergency should arise, there is no physical cause why the royal functions should not be exercised by his Majesty even now This is a more consoling, and satisfactory communication, than anyone now present could have set out with the hope of receiving when he came down to this House. Whether it be well founded or not, rests entirely on the responsibility of his Majesty's ministers, and I do hope, that as the attention of Parliament has been called to this most important point, and warning has been given to ministers, that a strict watch is kept over them, the House will not be put back much beyond the proper time, as to any communication which it may be necessary to make. The only question now before the House is, whether, in contemplation of a more speedy termination of the calamity that has befallen his Majesty, than any one in the House expected this night, the House will put itself forward to meet his Majesty on the resumption of his royal functions, with those important measures which are most necessary to the safety of the country, or, by adjourning this night, leave the question which the hon. baronet has put, to be repeated to-morrow, without any greater chance of a satisfactory explanation. It does seem to me, that pressing the question to a division, may be attended with bad consequences. I am sure such consequences are extremely remote from what the hon. baronet had in contemplation in putting the question. The only practical difference in meeting tomorrow, if the question should be pressed to a division, will be, that the House will meet to-morrow with the bill appointed to be read a second time this night, one stage backward; but if, on the division, the present motion should be rejected, it will be a precedent for future unnecessary delay. I again return my thanks to the hon. baronet, for the information he has procured, and I hope that ministers will now feel, that the eyes of the country are more anxiously turned towards them, particularly since the explanations which have taken place this night. In expressing, therefore, my warmest thanks to the hon. baronet who has brought forward this motion, I entreat and implore of him, not to press it to a division, that the ministers may feel the weight of the responsibility which they have thought proper to take upon themselves. If it should be pushed to a division, I fear I shall, for528the reasons I have stated, be under the necessity of voting against the adjournment; but if such a vole, if I should be put to the necessity of giving it, be construed into the slightest or most remote shadow of confidence in die present government, I shall be most egregiously misunderstood.

I have felt, I am sure, in common with every one present, the highest satisfaction at the improved state of health in which the House is given to understand that his Majesty is in; but this satisfaction base nevertheless, been damped by doubt and suspence. When it was stated that there was not any necessary suspension of the royal authority, as to such functions as it may be incumbent on his Majesty to discharge, the statement was qualified, as to such functions as extraordinary circumstances may render necessary. I wish the report had been more large, and less liable to be divided by distinctions: for I cannot conceive a royal authority competent to some things and not competent to others. If the royal authority is, in fact, competent to some duties, but not to all, dreadful indeed, as the right hon. gent. under the gallery (Mr. Pitt) has described it, is the responsibility which those who state themselves to be his Majesty's confidential ministers have assumed.

On this ground it is that I wish for explanation, for without explanation the assurance that has been given is incomplete. It would have been more satisfactory if his Majesty's ministers had been enabled to state, as a ground of the assurance they have given, that his Majesty communicated with them in the usual way and if they had not given it as an interpretation of the report of the physicians, when the words of that report appear so remote from any such interpretation.

He was at a loss to know what connexion there was between the administration of the Admiralty and the volunteer system. As the subject had been mentioned, it was with reluctance he came forward, though on every question relating to the Admiralty it might be supposed by the House that he would state his opinion. That, however, he had hitherto studiously avoided, I because he had been bred under the noble lord who presided over that board, and felt a friendship and love for him, which made him abstain from any observations that might bear upon that noble lord. Whatever charges attached to the conduct of the Admiralty, he was sure that the noble lord was exempt from them, but he was equally certain that blame was imputable somewhere. The noble lord had been by indisposition rendered incapable of attending to the arduous; duties of his situation. How far sickness might have impaired the faculties of the noble lord he could not tell. The business had been left to unskilful hands. The hon. admiral had no hesitation in saying, that the naval preparations for the defence of the coat were not adequate to the purpose; and this opinion did not rest on his own judgment, but he could call to the bar I every naval officer, from the highest to the lowest, to confirm it. He could call on many I hon. friends in the House to prove that ministers had not attended to this subject. He could call on ministers themselves to prove I that representations had been made to them so early as August, September, and October last, since which time the coast might have been placed in a most formidable state of defence. The hon. General (Maitland), had defended the noble lord's statement of the situation of our navy by a comparison with certain periods of last war, but he might as well have compared a first rate of the present day with Noah's Ark. Why had he not compared it with the French, fleet? He should have been shewn its superiority by a comparison with her fishing609boats, which had been alluded to last sessions. But these fishing-boats were now turned into fleets, into 74's, equal, if not superior in number to the fleets employed in blockading them. The noble lord's comparison should have shewn that our preparations to resist the invasion, were equal to those which were made to carry it into effect. How came it to pass that the enemy had 500 gun-boats ready to attack our coast, white we had only 20 to oppose them. Highly as he respected the noble lord, he could suggest no excuse for his inaccuracy, than his being unacquainted with the subject. As to the bill before the House, he did not find any clause in it relating to the regulation of the Sea Fencibles, who could not by the provisions of any existing law, be ordered from one part of the country to another. He had expected the Secretary of State would have adverted to this description of force in his opening of* the measure, and he should feel it his duty in this Committee to propose a clause for the purpose of extending the provisions of the bill to them. He hoped no time would be lost, as there was not a moment to lose. The hon. admiral concluded with asserting, that if proper attention had been paid to the business, we might have had at present 500 (he might say 5,000) gun boats, equal if not superior to those of the enemy.", "author_id": "/people/mr-george-berkeley", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

If the Admiralty had been culpable, it would be more regular to bring a direct charge against it, than to bring the question forward in the uncandid manner in which it had been introduced.&#x2014;It his language was not Parliamentary, he was very sorry for it; but he could not help feeling as he did on hearing the observations of the hon. admiral, who stated that the faculties of the noble lord at the head of the Admiralty had been impaired by illness. Indisposed he certainly had been, but his faculties were as strong as at the time lie taught the hon. admiral; how far the hon. admiral had improved by his instructions, he should prove hereafter. He had riot been in the habit of speaking in the House, but he was obliged to notice what had fallen from the hon. admiral. In consequence of his supposing the faculties of the nobles lord at the head of the Admiralty impaired, he must conclude that the fault lay with the \"inexperienced persons\" to whom the administration of the Admiralty devolved. As to his own experience, he should not say any610thing; but the House was acquainted with that of his colleague (Sir T. Trowbridge), That gentleman's first voyage had been to the East-Indies, where he had continued 12 years. His services since were well known. He should beg here to ask the hon. admiral where his foreign service had been? The hon. admiral had alluded to the propriety of attacking the enemy's flotillas in their own ports with small craft, but he should be glad to learn how he would manage that? To him it appeared impossible; the whole coast of Boulogne was fortified from Cape Grisnes, and supplied with vast numbers of mortars and guns, and where frigates could not go with safety it was perfectly incomprehensible to him how small craft could. It had been intimated by the hon. admiral, that they should be employed in opposing the gunboats of the enemy. Ridiculous He should state his opinions as he felt them. He was not used to the smooth, flowing language spoken in that House, and should, therefore, utter his sentiments in the downright, rough language of his profession. If they were, employed in this way, the first account that would be received after the next gale of wind, would be their total destruction. Another purpose for which the hon. admiral recommended small craft, was to oppose the enemy's flotillas on our own shores, by creeping like crabs along the coast. The hon. admiral might like to try his luck there, but there were no able and experienced officer who could think of any success from such efforts.&#x2014;As to the hon. admiral's charge against the ordnance, he could say, that that department executed all its business in the most expeditious manner. If the charge was meant against (he Admiralty, this was not the place to discuss the question, whether the. gun-boats were d-serving of the met it generally attributed to them. If the gun-boats had not been equipped in such a hurry, they would have been much better fitted up.&#x2014;With respect to the observations of the hon. colonel on his statement respecting the low rate of insurance, he still continued to look upon that as the best Criterion of the state of our navy; because Buonaparte would not have taken the seamen out of the privateers so long before he wanted them, so far back as May or June last. The privateers did not put to sea, not because they had not seamen, but because they were blockaded.

The levy en-masse in Flanders in 1793, which was neither composed of regular troops, nor consisted: of an armed peasantry, and fighting for their country, and every thing dear to them, could yet not make any impress on on British troops.

{"date": ["1804", "feb", "29"], "content": "&#x2014;I own, Sir, that I am much surprised at the language used by my hon. friend under the gallery (Gen. Maitland), and still more surprised at the very extraordinary sentiment with which the hon. gent, behind me (Col. Eyre) closed his speech. Of the latter I shall first take notice. The hon. gent, seems highly to disapprove of any thing in the shape of opposition to his Majesty's present ministers, and expresses an opinion that all parties should combine to support them, in order to second their endeavours for the national defence, and, in a word, that all should be unanimity for that object; but although the hon. gent, does so broadly assert that dissention prevails, and that means are used to embarrass the operations of government, I would call upon the hon. gent, to point out a single instance where any obstruction has been offered to the exertions of government to provide for our security. It is easy for any gent, to use a round assertion, but I challenge the hon. gent, to quote any case to justify the charge that any party has been backward to contribute its assistance to the government, whatever they may think of the ministers by whom the government is administered. AM, in fact, is, and has been, union for the public safety, from the moment that safety has been pronounced in danger. The people have, every where, pressed forward in the cause of their country, and their zeal has received no damp or check from any quarter, but from the ministers themselves and, without looking to the innumerable proofs of ardent and active exertion made by the gentlemen of that party to whom the613hon gent, seemed more particularly to allude, I shall only cite one remarkable instance in the North of England. Let the hon. gent, look to a distinguished and hon. friend of mine in that direction (die Duke of Northumberland), who, to be sure, could not hold forth such a brilliant example of patriotism as he has done, if his property v/ere not very extensive, but his efforts are not the less honourable on that account. Thai noble duke has, to his immortal honour, raised a body of not less than 150Q men, whom he has cloathed, equipped, disciplined, and furnished with every necessary, arms alone excepted. These they have had from government. What union, then, does the hon. gent, require? The most cordial union exists every where in support of the country and the government, and I believe the union is almost equally general against the ministers; but yet I am astonished to find some gentlemen forward to vaunt of those ministers, and to contend that the Zealand union which so universally prevails are attributable to those ministers. Why, certainly, they have been produced by ministers&#x2014;but how. By their mismanagement: and if upon this they mean to ground their triumph, they are no doubt entitled to it. They have brought the country to the brink of destruction, and have made us all unite for our own security. Really, therefore, if ministers will claim merit for thus exciting the public spirit, I confess that I cannot deny the justice of their pretensions.&#x2014;With respect to the observations made by my hon. friend, I repeat that I heard them with surprise, not less as to their substance, than as to the tone and manner in which they were delivered. I have often had occasion to defend the freedom of debate, and I declare I never witnessed a more extraordinary attempt made to interrupt it, than in the instance I allude to. It seemed to be the drift of my hon. friend's remarks, that no officer below the rank of a lieut. gen. should presume to state his opinion in this House upon any military topic connected with the defence of the country. But how different is this from the conduct pursued by my hon. friend on a former occasion I remember when he undertook to censure, and very freely too, the proceedings of officers superior to him, I will not say in abilities, but very much so in rank; when he was only a major, he commented, and with some severity, upon Generals Meadows, Musgrave and others, and my hon. friend exposed himself in so doing to some severe adimad-versions, against which I defended him. I hope, therefore, that he will not be surprised614if, acting upon the same principle which influenced my conduct with regard to himself, I now take up the defence of the hon. officer who has been this night the object of his attack. If, indeed, the opinions advanced by my hon. friend were pushed to the extent which he appears to wish, it would go to this, that no officer who is a member of this House, however high his reputation, (and surely no man will question the reputation and military talents of the hon. officer to whom my hon. friend has alluded,) should presume to give his opinion upon military subjects to a superior, officer. I understand it has been said, that such subjects should not be discussed at all in this House, but that the matter should be entitely left to the consideration of officers of experience To this opinion, however, I never will subscribe; but even if true, who, I would be glad to know, has a stronger claim to attention on the score of I experience than the hon officer I refer to; and. yet my hon. friend would restrain him, and. why? not least his opinions should clash with those of other officers of high rank and authority, but because the matter ought, in my hon. friend's judgment, be left entirely to the consideration of such persons; but yet my hon. friend does not venture to say that the points alluded to by the hon. officer, have been, or will he considered by the high officers, for whose monopoly, not only of military power, but of military I knowledge and attention, he seems to be so very anxious. My hon. friend does not. know, however,, that their attention extends to all the topics alluded to by the hon. officer, and still he would wish him to be silent upon those rno3t important points, not because he actually differs with the high officers, for whom my hon. friend feels such reverence, but least he should differ from them on some things which they may hereafter think proper to consider. This was not the only opposition which the hon. officer experienced from my hon friend; for, after condemning the general principle of the hon. officers' at all entering into the discussion, my hot), friend endeavoured to combat the detail of his speech.&#x2014;a speech for which the House is highly indebted to him,&#x2014;a speech containing mote professional information, than any speech perhaps; hat I ever heard in this House, and conveyed in a manner so perspicuous as to be more intelligible to men unacquainted with military tactics, than military essays generally are.&#x2014;The first part of ray hon. friend's objections applied to the argument so often used against the volunteer system, on the ground of She615exemptions granted to the volunteers; but I would ask, can any man seriously contend that such an argument is not well founded, and that those exemptions have not materially impeded the ballots for the militia and the army of reserve, and also crippled the recruiting for the regular army? The fact is too notorious to be denied. My hon. friend, however, took up these exemptions as a matter justly doe to the volunteers, and highly right in ministers to propose and Parliament to adopt. But, if it was a matter of right, it was certainly right by mistake, for there is no doubt that ministers did pot intend to grant tuck exemptions at the time the volunteer bill was passed last summer. If they did, it doss not appear on the face of that bill; and sure I am, that it was not so understood in any part of the country that I have heard of. On the contrary, I remember that subscriptions were set on foot in various parishes, to relieve the volunteers from the ballots for the militia or army of reserve, by providing substitutes for such of them as might be chosen for cither of those descriptions of force. Is it possible, then, if exemptions were in the contemplation of the framers of the bill I have mentioned, that it should be so universally misunderstood: and yet, it seems, it was; for some time after the enactment of this bill, out crime the opinion of the attorney-general, who was not, I must suppose, at all consulted in the first instance; or the bill would have been explicit. No! Ministers first frame Acre of Parliament to puzzle him, and then they ask his opinion upon them. His opinion upon subjects thus circumstanced were likely to be erroneous and so they have happened to be.&#x2014;I am flattered that ray opinion respecting the preference of an armed peasantry to the volunteer system happens to agree with that of the hon. officer to whom I have already referred. But my hon. friend has said, that the volunteers would be preferable for active service. I would, however, appeal to his judgment, whether they could be competent to the same duties as a regular army; and whether they can be fit for any other description of service as an active, hardy, armed peasantry? The hon. gent. who spoke last has referred to the state of the volunteers in a particular county: but does he mean to say, that the state of our force would not be much improved, that the defence of the counties of Sussex and Kent would not be better secured by the establishment of the principle of an armed peasantry, than by the present? amount of the volunteer force, to be found hi these or in any of the other counties616particularly on the coast? Some stress has been laid on the advantages likely to arise from the colour of the cloathing, &c.; of the volunteers, as contrasted with an armed peasantry; but this very difference I reckon among the defects of the volunteer system; and the quibbling remarks on a smock-frocked army are not worthy of reply. If the amount of the volunteers be dwelt upon; if I am told that we have in them an army of 400,000 men, I answer, that by resorting to an armed peasantry, we might have two millions, and more effective, requiring less drilling, easier prepared for the objects to which it is right to apply them, and less expensive. My principal objections to the volunteers, indeed, arise out of their expense and their mode of instruction, and to the latter particularly. Too much time is employed in endeavouring to teach that I which is not necessary, and which they never can completely learn. By such a mode of proceeding much mischief is, and much more may be, done. To this, indeed, the words of Pope may be appliedA little learning is a dangerous thing;and for this reason, that men are apt to draw inaccurate deductions, and to rest upon imperfect grounds. The volunteers, by such injudicious instructions, are withdrawn from, that which they might acquire with facility and use with much more effect, and the operation of such a system will be to give their minds a wrong direction. If, however, it was wished to render the volunteers perfect in this system of discipline, how came it that the instructions should have commenced so late that, but a few months ago, many volunteer corps were without a single musket, and even at this hour there are several volunteers who have never fired a ball in their lives? Men should not be obliged to travel through the tedious course of military tactics when the danger was so urgent as it is admitted to be on all hands. A force not thus perplexed with circuitous lessons would be much easier collected, and nice effectual; armed also with other weapons than muskets, they, perhaps, would be able more completely to annoy the enemy, remember that some miserable expedient have been resorted to in order to depredate the opinions of the hon. officer. His recommendation of pikes was at first discountenanced, and yet, since then, his plan has been adopted and acted upon to a considerable extent. Above 100,000 pikes have been distributed by government, and I have no doubt those weapons will be more useful in the hands of peasants who shall not undergo the trouble of any rehearsal617before they come to action, than volunteers trained to the musket.&#x2014;I have heard that some gentlemen are of opinion, that the volunteers might be most advantageously employed by attaching them in the hour of service to battalions of the line. Of such a plan I very much disapprove, or of any project to bring them into action, in a solid body, When the hon. officer on the lower bench recommended pikes to be distributed to the volunteers, ministers confessed there was a scarcity of muskets, and that circumstance alone, independently of the known efficacy of that weapon, particularly manifested in the course of the French revolution, was sufficient.&#x2014;The hon. member behind me (Col. Eyre) has insisted upon the importance of the volunteers, for a very strange reason indeed, which he urged with great confidence, namely, that the volunteers however, as he said, they were depreciated in this country, were held to be so formidable by the enemy, that they operated to prevent him from attempting his threatened plan of invasion, although he was ready in June last; but, if he had come then he would have surprised a vast proportion of the volunteers without arms. If however, the one my was completely prepared in June, and the volunteers in their then state were really sufficient to intimidate him, there can be no danger whatever, now that that body is so much larger and so much better disciplined; nor can it be necessary to introduce this bill, or to make any farther bustle of preparation. However, perhaps the enemy has postponed the execution of his design for other reasons. Possibly he waits until the volunteers shall learn their exercise&#x2014;until they are properly drilled ! This would be a magnanimous proceeding&#x2014;but to be serious. I know that there are many different opinions upon the mode provided for disciplining the volunteers, and I have my doubts. Upon this, however, I have no doubt; that the system is altogether not comparable to that of an armed peasantry, who could be had in every district in sufficient numbers, and who would furnish the most powerful assistance to the regular army. It should be recollected, that the great defence of a country consists of an armed people. The enemy may have a large disciplined army, and so may you to resist him; but that from which you would derive your great advantage, that which always must form the powerful opponent of an invading army, would be an armed peasantry. That should be your principal defence. It is like the weapon with which nature furnishes animals for their protection. It is the great618bulwark of a country. You might thus have an aid in every village and town, more numerous and effective than your volunteers; and you might put the country in such a state of defence, that the enemy, even after a victory, should he obtain one, over your regular army in the field, dare not send out a detachment to forage, or for any other purpose, without exposing them to be shot at from every hedge, from every cottage, from every enclosure&#x2014;by men, not dressed so as to be easily perceivable, not wearing those coloured garments which would put the enemy's troops on their guard. Thus might they be harassed and weakened, even after being victorious in the field 5 and we must not be so sanguine as to suppose that they may not sometimes have the advantage; for, however brave our troops may be, and no man has a higher opinion of their valour and skill than I have, we must attend to that calculation which has ever been regarded by the highest military authorities, even by Julius Cassar himself, that fortune has a great share in deciding the events of war. When such events should happen to be against us, I would particularly look to the assistance of the smock-frocked force, as some gentlemen have termed it. A noble lord in treating this subject, has said, that he was old enough to recollect the American rebellion, as he called it, and, certainly, if he recollected all the circumstances of the case he so describes, he would be aware that the term of rebellion was not applicable, and that the use of it was long since abandoned. He would also recollect that which was very fortunate to the subject of this debate, that America was victorious over her opponents, not because she had a large regular army, but because she was an armed country, and the result of that popular armament was, that two of our best generals, at the head of some of the best troops, we re compelled to surrender. Precisely that kind of force which so conquered in America, which emancipated Holland, which triumphed in Switzerland, and performed such prodigies of valour in la Vendue and Ireland, is what I should recommend to be resorted to in this country. The misfortune is, with a view to this, that, as I understand, the volunteers have taken so many arms that enough are not left for arming the peasantry; but there are weapons in abundance to be found to suit them, and they will not require much training. If this plan be not attended to, many parts of the country will, in the event of invasion, be left619quite defenceless; for when a volunteer corps is called into service, what becomes of the town or village to which it may belong? Their natural defenders are gone where they are not likely to be so useful as they might be, under another system, to the ultimate security of the country and the overthrow of the enemy. This is a painful consideration; but it naturally arises out of a bad system&#x2014;a system which rather perplexes the volunteers than contributes to improve them, which, in fact, overloads them with a kind of instruction of no practical utility, instead of giving them that which would fit them for the object to which their service is applicable. This is the mischief; it is as it were to send a man to a university to learn general knowledge, and afterwards to tell him that he must study to qualify for a divine or a physicist!. I should think it would be better to begin the education of the one and the other, with that which might best fit them for their proper pursuits. It would therefore be much wiser to teach the volunteers, not the stiff and intricate man&#x0153;uvres of Prussian discipline, but that only which is essential, not that which should assimilate them to a regular army, which has begun to learn such discipline; but that which should assimilate them to an armed peasantry, to whom it is naturally extremely desirable that they should be more alike than they are. Nothing can be a greater mistake than to suppose, that the colour of the volunteer clothing will be advantageous the event of invasion, as the Secretary of State enumerated for this reason, that an intimate connexion between them and our regular army must injure the latter; and also, that if they should be defeated in any instance, the singularity of dress will of coarse induce the enemy to suppose them soldiers, and that supposition will tend to their encouragement. My wish is, that instead of such troops, we should have the people armed, in order that in every direction the enemy might have persons to annoy, without being warned by alarming appearances; that he should always have reason to fear in whatever direction he moved; that the apprehension of meeting a foe in a brown coat should haunt him like a spectre; that he should feel that he could not pass through a lane or along a hedge with safety. If you abandon this plan, I am sure you will considerably diminish the fears of an invading enemy; for when he conceives he has none bat red coated foes to meet with, his confidence will, of course, be greater. The evil of this goes very deep.620It applies to the principle of the volunteer system. The mischief of affording the enemy the means of ascertaining the whole amount of your military defence is extremely obvious, When he becomes acquaint ed that he has only 500,000 men to con tend with, you of course do him a service; he will then know his enemies by their dress.&#x2014;The hon. gent, who has just sat down has remarked on the tendency of the sentiments so often urged by my right hon. friend on the bench below me (Mr. Wind ham) respecting the volunteer system, and seems to imagine that the right hon. gent, was inconsistent in accepting a command in a volunteer corps; but inconsistency does not at all follow from this circumstance. The right hon. gent, avails himself of the system, bad as it is, to promote the public defence, because there is no other.&#x2014;As to the whole of the remarks made upon this system, many of which have been misrepresented, as well as the motives of those who made diem, I beg to observe, that without wishing to abolish the system altogether, it is impossible to remedy its defects, it they be remediable, without having in view the principles of a better system.&#x2014;With regard to the bill before the House, it in reality contains nothing in the shape of a remedy, nor indeed any thing at all new, and the system it professes to support cannot, in my mind, be of long duration; it is not of a durable nature. The dread of invasion, which produced it, will not long avail, and as soon as the danger disappears, or may not be attented to, and which may be the case, should it long continue to be merely talked of, the spirit of the volunteers will, from the nature of the human mind, be likely to relax; and who can pretend to say how long, for how many years, the enemy may keep up all the appearences of an intension to invade us, without actually at tempting it? These considerations weigh with my mind very strongly, and confirm my opinion of the superior character of an armed peasantry.&#x2014;As to the opinion, that in order to guard against the evil of a slow recruiting for the regular army, it would be desirable to form a kind of perpetual army of reserve, to be raised by ballot, from, which volunteering for general service was to be more encouraged, I shall at pre sent make but one observation, namely, that I am no friend to the extension of the principle of raising men by ballot. It is a kind of lottery, in which ten men may be said to toss up which shall serve; or in stead of each contributing 40l. one to contribute 20.&#x2014;To she allusions which have621been so frequently made to the conduct of the naval department, I think it would be much fairer to bring forward the subject for a full discussion. I have no doubt that the noble lord who presides over that board, will be able to indicate his character; but, at the same time, as so many charges have been thrown out against the Admiralty, I think it would be better at once to institute an inquiry, which will enable the House to make up its mind upon (his most important subject; and, I am sure that that noble personage is not one of those who would be likely to shrink from inquiry.", "author_id": "/people/mr-charles-fox-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

{"date": ["1804", "feb", "29"], "content": "said, that the principles and opinions which he formerly professed upon this subject, he still retained. They were confirmed by experience, as far as experience had gone, and had now, in every point, the sanction of the very high authority (Col. Craufurd's) which the House had just heard. He was anxious to recall this fact631to the attention of the House, because it might serve to counteract the effect of the speech of Ids right hon. friend (Mr. Pitt), whose great powers of statements were very likely to have turned the House to a different view of the subject. Notwithstanding these powers, he must still think that his hon. friend was wrong, and that he was right. It was not true, what had been said by many, that he disparaged the volunteers, lie did not disparage the volunteers, nor object to them individually, in any respect: what he condemned was the system on which they were formed, and the uses to which it was meant they should be applied yet, with these objections full in his mind, he knew that such was the pressure of the immediate danger, and such the general deficiency of our military system, that no great part of it, however objectionable, could be. given up at once, or ought so to be changed as to leave any considerable void in our means of defence, even for a short time. Fie did nor propose, or wish, therefore, that the volunteer force should be disbanded or greatly red need: he doubted, in fact, whether by what he should recommend, it would be so much reduced as in the way about to be adopted: he wished if only to be put upon the footing on which it originally stood, or was supposed, at least, to stand, by those who first engaged in it, namely, that of service free from any species of compulsion, but divested also of any inducements other than those which were furnished by mere zeal and patriotism. In this state, whatever good it did would be pure and unmixed. It would not operate, as it did at present, to the continued diminution of a force more valuable than itself; a force, which, if the present system continued, must be for ever growing less and less.&#x2014;Endeavours were made to show that the volunteer system did not produce this effect, but that the recruiting of the army was rather better than worse for it. The way in which this was made out was, as the House, had heard, that by the military spirit which it infused, men were induced to enter into the army, who would not otherwise have thought of that mode of life. He would oppose to that the number of men, whatever it might be, who finding in themselves something of a military passion were satisfied to give it vent in corps of this description, and remain there when otherwise they might have gone further. It might possibly happen that neither number was very considerable; but he saw no reason to suppose that the last might, not be as great as the former.&#x2014;So much for theassistancewhich the volunteer corps were supposed to give to the recruiting. Theprejudicethey632occasioned was easily understood. In consequence of the number of exemptions, the lists were often exhausted, so that the recruiting of the army of reserve, the only source of recruiting now left for the line, in those instances stood still; and at all events sustained a great delay: the consequence of all which was, that the army of reserve had stopt at 36,000 instead of 50,000, and had little apparent probability of ever getting much further. But the principal mode in which the volunteer system operated to the prejudice of the army was by increasing the price of substitutes, and thereby bringing things to the state before alluded to, namely, that in which the army of reserve was the only channel by which recruits were received. This it did in four ways. First, it lessened the number of men liable to be balloted, and thereby retarded, and in many instances absolutely prevented, the filling up the army of reserve. 2dly, it threw the ballot upon a class of men, less disposed, from their habit and situation, to serve in person, and producing therefore, in proportion to their numbers, a greater demand for substitutes. 3dly, it lessened the number of men, who would be willing to engage as substitutes, and 4thly, it placed those who might be willing so to engage, in a situation infinitely more advantageous for them in making their bargain. A man would engage as a substitute on very different terms when he had a ballot hanging over his head, and when he stood under the shelter of an exemption: as it might happen very well, that in the one case he would be willing to engage on moderate terms, and in the other not 10 engage at all. These, it must be presumed, were the causes which kept the amount of bounty at its present height. At least some causes there must he that kept it so; for there it was: and was not only as high as ever, but seemed, according to the phrase of the stock exchange, to be looking upwards.&#x2014;With respect to the uses of the volunteers, he would not now enter upon them, so much having been already said on that subject, nor pursue the comparison between them and an armed peasantry. That an armed peasantry would be able to stop an army, he never had said at any moment: he had often, indeed, said the direct contrary: but then he must observe, that a body of volunteers, in the form at present proposed, would be equally incapable of stopping an army, and the attempt in the mean-while of doing so, while equally unsuccessful, would be infinitely more fatal. The use of light troops, whatever might be their description, was to co-operate with an army, not to stand in lieu of it: the fault he633found with the present system was, that it was calculated with a view to the latter of these uses, namely, that of providing a sort of substitute for the army, and not for the former. It was in vain to say, that by training men for a more regular service you did not unfit them for what was irregular: that such kind of instruction would do themno harm.The inference might be true, if instruction were a thing to be had at no expense, with no sacrifice of Lime or of the means of acquiring what was more valuable. It would do menno harmas light troops, if they were all to be taught Arabick; yet he supposed no one would recommend or much approve that course of instruction. But it was not altogether true, indeed very much otherwise, as had been ably explained by his j hon. friend (Col. Craufurd), that the sort of training, adopted for the volunteer, did no harm. It might do very material harm, and lead to the most serious mischiefs. It might well be doubted, whether even the sort of mixed training taught to the French army, though forced upon them by various considerations not generally applicable, and in traduced in a form very different from that in which it was applied to our volunteers, would be found generally advantageous, But, in another instance, which had been alluded to, and which more nearly resembled what we had to consider, viz. the light troops of the Austrian army, it was universally agreed, as he understood, by the Austrian officers speaking not only with great professional knowledge, but with actual experience of the thing, that the practice which had been introduced of giving to their light troops a degree of regular training had been injurious to them as light troops, and rendered them in fact considerably less valuable, in that respect, than they had formerly-been.&#x2014;But, whatever might be thought on this point, that is to say, whether any considerable portion of regular training might not prove even injurious to troops meant in the main to act as irregulars, this was certain, that to trust to irregulars as regulars must be pregnant with the most fatal dangers. It was, in our case, to renew the risk of that catastrophe which produced nothing less than the conquest of this country 800 years ago. It was by an action such as that now talked of, but with troops not so disproportioned probably in discipline and experience, that Harold lost his crown and his life, and that the kingdom passed under a foreign yoke. This truth ought to be for ever remembered, that by embodying troops, if you in some cases increased their chance of victory, you, to a certainty, exposed them634to greater defeat; and the great question to be decided was, whether from the nature of the troops and the time allowed for training of them, you were likely to gain more one way than you were to lose in the other.", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-windham-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

The right honourable gentleman under the gallery (Mr. Pitt) had alluded to the conduct of the admiralty; on that subject he was not at present prepared to give any opinion. He confessed that he was partial to this noble lord at the head of that department he admired his professional talents, and gratefully acknowledged his public services. Lord St. Vincent had all his good wishes, and on this account he most heartily wished him a better defender than Lord Castlereagh. That noble lord had defended the first lord of the admiralty, by a comparison with what had been done by former naval administrations. He talked of the navy in 1755, when in fact, the scale of naval force then was no more a standard of naval force now, than that of 1755 was to be measured by the navies of antiquity. The question was not, what, the naval strength of this country in any former war was, but what were the means, and what were the necessities of service, by which our exertions were to be regulated. It was not by referring to dates, and by summing up statements, that the first lord of the admiralty could be justified, nor was it on that ground, he was sure, that Lord St. Vincent would chuse to re this defence. He did not know where, or in what register, the noble lord might have found the arguments562he had used, but precisely the same mode of defence was adopt d by the admiralty in the American war when for two years our navy had been inferior to that of France. It had been s\"id on the ministerial side, that many of the argument had been used before; it would have been better if it could have been said that they were answered before. Whenever it was contended that the exertions for the public defence in every department were inadequate, ministers thought it was enough it they had done a much within the first year of war a had ever be done before. But could they be allowed to date their preparations only from March last? He would not say whether those he believed the peace was likely to last were nature's fools\" or no, but ministers hid persuaded some that the peace was solid, though they themselves had since repeatedly declared that, from the moment of its conclusion, the conduct of the French governmant was but one system of aggression. In that case, therefore, they ought to have been prepared to pat an end' to what they now hold out as a hollow truce, at the most favourable moment, and a pretty moment they did chuse. It it be true That, ever since the peace, the French government had never ceased from insuit and aggression, ministers ought to have been in a state of preparation adequate to what the natural result of such a situation required; and instead of being the first year of the war, it ought to be considered, in regard cf. the state of preparation in which we ought to hive been, as the third.&#x2014;With respect to the bid itself, he could not help taking notice of the extraordinary assertions of ministers, that it was their intention from the beginning that volunteers should have liberty to resign; they thought any other system pernicious. Yet had they taken the attorney general's opinion, which declared that volunteers could not resign. This opinion was circulated with great profusion, and re-com men tied to magistrates as the rule of their decision. Yet all this time ministers had intended to give the power of resignation, they thought the contrary principle pernicious in the highest degree, and they now say-that they would have proposed to give liberty to resign if the law had settled. This surely was a contradiction 5 and unless they had so gravely asserted that they always intended to allow the power of resignation, he should have inferred that they approved the attorney general's opinion, and that they had, from the first. intended the law as he had declared it. He should have been inclined to believe that the conduct of men disapproving of the opinion and of the law would,563in circulating it, have announced to the lords lieutenants, that it did not that their itentions, that they intended to move for an alteration of the law, while in the mean time they would have instructed commanders of corps to permit resignation to take place. But nothing of this had they done, when Parliament met in November; nay, after bringing in another hill on the subject of the volunteers, no mention whatever was made of a'tering a law, the consequences of which are admitted to have been so pernicious to the volunteer system! Nay, since the attorney general's opinion had been given, it had actually been proposed in another House to clear up the point by law, when one of the secretaries of state declared, that that opinion was a sufficient rule for magistrates. In a word, on this point, he must have concluded from the conduct of ministers, that they fully approved the law as interpreted by the attorney general, and nothing but their grave acceleration prevented him from thinking so still. As to general measures of defence, it was not his intention to follow the example of Mr. Pitt in proposing any; and, in truth, one reason was, that I lie House was so little inclined to adopt his suggestions, and he was afraid that even Mr. Pitt was not likely to be more successful: unless, perhaps, there was some ordour of cilice still about him which might have its influence. He believed, however, that Mr. Pitt had not much greater prospect of seeing his plans adopted by the ministers than his himself had. He thought it better, therefore, to stick to the bill before the House, whatever were its defects, particularly as it was now the conviction of all, except ministers themselves, that the country was net in that state of defence which, from the immense means confided to ministers, it ought to have been in. And upon the volunteer system, therefore, we were forced to place a good deal of dependence. It was rather singular, however, that after the volunteer system had existed above seven months, it should be necessary to begin to make new regulations about attendance, silence in the ranks. Sec. &c;, and yet the system itself was resorted to on the ground of immediate danger. It was now said, that the danger was immediate, and if it was likely to arrive in tour or five weeks, it was bet to have the volunteers several times every week, than to purpose to extend the number of drills every week. But with regard to the permanence of the system, it might be proper to adopt another course. It might he necessary to give up some of the perfection which more frequent attendance would bestow, least the volunteers should be so ha-564rassed, that they might be induced to abandon the service altogether. As to the right of election he did not see that much was to be done. It might, as had been said, be left to the good sense of the people. But the conduct of ministers in menacing those that should not accommodate themselves to the wishes of government, was calculated to lay the foundation of much dissatisfaction. He hoped, however, that the volunteers would not be bullied oat of their determination to defend the country. It was curious that ministers accused those on the opposition side of the House, of attacking the volunteers, and arrogated the merit of defending them, the fact was, however, that he and his honourable friends, said merely that the volunteers never could be rendered so good as regular troops, while ministers, who affected to defend, were they who levied fines upon the volunteers, and threatened to disband them if they insisted on what at the beginning was conceived to be their right.&#x2014;Mr. Fox concluded with stating, that a period would soon arrive in which it would be the duty of Parliament to enter into a general enquiry into the state of public defence, which was neither adequate to the means with which ministers had been entrusted, nor to what our situation required.", "author_id": "/people/mr-charles-fox-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

The right hon. gent, had apologised for our naval force being lower than it ought to have been, an account of their being few landsmen.

If ministers thought it wrong, as they now confessed, instead of circulating, they should have remedied. They had an opportunity; to do so, for upon the occasion of the bill alluded to, he said it was easy for them to have added a clause to remove that which they now acknowledge to have been a hardship, and contrary to the idea of what the law ought to be. He should not, however, at that late hour, go at length into the question. He hoped, however, that a serious inquiry would be made into the state of our preparations for defence.

What lie said was strictly in order, and advanced then with a view to save the time of the House; the penalties were applicable to the funds, ids observations were therefore in order. As to the question he reprobated the utter want of economy in the system. A large regular force might have over and over again been put in activity for ness money. In process of time, the present sources would fail; individuals would every year become more weary or less able to pay the contributions.

He was sorry he had not made himself more intelligible to the rt hon. gent. No person could be more anxious than he was to be favourable, to Ireland, particularly when its first and most important article of export was in question; but he thought it would be unfair and inconsistent with the principles of the union, if the articles of the one country did not leave the ports of the other precisely under the same circumstances as they would do the ports where such articles were manufactured. It was fair that articles of cotton manufacture should go from the ports of Ireland with the same duty as from this country. Indeed none of the manufactures of this country were free from the export duty. Would it then be reasonable that Irish linen going out with British linen should be free from the export duty while the British linen was subject to it? In this case the British manufacturer must labour under an almost insuperable disadvantage, a disadvantage of not less than 4 per cent. But the great object was to raise the taxes within the year, and not to be693running in debt to this country, as the practice had hitherto been; and in order to avoid this evil, which was certainly the greater of the two evils, some inconveniency must be submitted to, which ought to be less felt when it is farther considered that this duty only operated as a war tax, and that consequently it would terminate with the war.&#x2014;But. it was still less to be complained of when it was considered that every article used in the different stages of that manufacture comes in free of duty, and that a bounty likewise is given on its exportation.&#x2014;The rt. hon. gent, here begged leave to put a case: suppose linen of Irish manufacture and linen of English or Scotch manufacture were to leave the same port, and were destined for the same market, would not the British manufacturer have a right to complain were he to pay a duty from which the Irish manufacturer was not only exempted, but enjoyed the additional advantage also of a premium, and of the free import of his raw materials? He would appeal to any Irishman, however indifferent he might be to the interests of his country, if he would not think himself entitled loudly to complain did the converse of such a proposition really exist? Mow, therefore, could we require from others what we should be unwilling to concede ourselves? He would be sorry in any degree to disappoint that rt. hon. gent, or to meet his disapprobation in this measure, whose care he knew had been uniformly directed to the support and prosperity of that manufacture. Rather than incur disapprobation, indeed, he flattered himself that he also would be considered as its warm supporter, and as a coadjutor to those who were its best friends. He would be happy, indeed, to exonerate that manufacture from the duty in question, but found that it could not be done consistently with the other interests of the country, and without the greatest injustice to the British manufacturer. As an honest man, therefore, he was decidedly of opinion, that no such exemption could be made.", "author_id": "/people/mr-isaac-corry", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

{"date": ["1804", "mar", "07"], "content": "&#x2014;I rise, Sir, in pursuance of the notice I gave upon a former night, to call your attention to a subject by no means new to the House. It has frequently been discussed incidentally, and in all these discussions there has hitherto appeared to be a material difference of opinion amongst his Majesty's ministers, as to where the blame was input able. It will not, then, be deemed surprising if his Majesty's ministers, wish all the means of information they possess, have not been able to form a decided and unanimous opinion, that there should exist also doubts in this House, and if these doubts do exist, that no individual like myself, should wish to bring forward this inquiry in a shape which, in the firm instance, will admit a wide field of discussion, and, if it meets the approbation of the House, will afford an opportunity of procuring every species of information that can tend to elucidate a transaction of such importance to the honor of the Irish government, and the safety and happiness of the Irish people.&#x2014;I shall not inquire what has induced the hen. Admiral (Berkeley) to wave his motion, but I totally disclaim the intention with which he, from the most he norable motives of friendship, had been induced to bring it forward. I feel myself called upon to consider the subject on a more enlarged scale, and without wishing to throw a larger share of blame upon one part of the government, to exculpate another, that the subject should undergo a full, fair, and can did investigation. Upon any motion of inquiry relative to Ireland, it was formerly objected, that the Parliament of that country were competent to the management of their own affairs. Such an objection is since the Union, not only impossible, but appears to afford an opportunity of impressing the necessity of a strict attention to their welfare. It cannot be doubted that great sacrifices were made by the members of Ireland, and I hope no member of the British Parliament opposed that measure, without first reflecting on the important duty he took upon himself, and without a determination to feel an equal738regard for the interests of that country upon all occasions. Those interests were formerly the exclusive care of the Irish Legislature; their discussions were free from the weighty and important considerations of foreign policy, and their whole attention was directed to the improvement of the internal state of the country, and to keep a jealous and watchful eye over the government in whose hands their lives and property were placed. All these considerations are now blended with the great duties of a general attention to the interests of the empire at large, and I earnestly hope they will equally become subjects of serious and important concern to every gentleman who hears me, and that we shall prove we agreed to the measure of Union, not for the purpose of depriving Ireland of any benefit, but of lending our assistance, and all the abilities possessed by this House, in endeavouring to raise her to an equal share of prosperity with this part of the empire, and to conciliate the minds of the lower orders in that country, that instead of being objects of jealousy to the government, they may, like the people of this country, become a formidable increase to that national force, which we may be called upon to exert against the common enemy.&#x2014;Another objection is of more recent date. A motion in some respects similar to that which I shall submit, was opposed upon two grounds, the first, that any motion \"not proposed to be followed up by any practical measure, with a view to some beneficial effect, must at all times be liable to great objections.\"&#x2014;In the present case, it is my intention to move for a Committee of the whole House, to inquire into the conduct of the government of Ireland relative to the insurrection of the 23d July, and the previous conduct of that government, a far as it relates to the said insurrections; and I have no hesitation in saying, that a beneficial effectmustresult from this enquiry. If, on the one hand, it should appear that the government of Ireland were active and vigilant, that they had taken every means of procuring correct information, that they had had the ability to discriminate what was true, and what was exaggerated; if the Lord Lieutenant should appear to have been at his post, prepared, in concert with the Commander of the Forces, to give the necessary orders, anxiously watching over the lives of his Majesty's subjects entrusted to his care, and placed under his immediate protection&#x2014;is any man prepared to say, that a beneficial effect will not be derived by removing doubts which are entertained, and very generally too, of the conduct of the I Irish government? Will no beneficial effect739be produced by increasing the confidence of the people of that country in this House? Yes, Sir, the Irish are a generous and grateful people, the constitution of their country, which has undergone a material change, teaches them now to look up tousfor protection, justice, and a redress of grievances. Let them not apply in vain. Let us not consider them as empty words, but consider their substance, and their consequences, and let the Irish nation never have reason to assert, that their interests are neglected, or that justice is denied them by this House.&#x2014;If, on the other hand, it should appear, that government disregarded all the information given them, despised all advice, had been so ignorant of the real state of the country, as to be incapable of discrimination; that during their administration no system of police was arranged, with which they kept up a constant communication&#x2014;if it should appear, that though frequently warned, they were not aware of the extent of the preparations, or inclined to give credit to them&#x2014;will any man deny, that a beneficial effect will be produced by an immediate application to the throne, to dismiss those under whose very eye an insurrection has been matured, by whose negligence a great and illustrious character has been dragged from the arms of his daughter, and murdered in her presence, who, if proper precautions had been taken, might still have been contributing to the happiness of his family, and the advantage of his country?&#x2014;The other ground of opposition upon that occasion was the early period at which the inquiry was called for. But when it is recollected, that in the year 1798, when the rebellion was over, and individuals brought to justice, the Irish government came to Parliament, with ail the information they possessed, it will not be deemed objectionable at this hour, when we are under precisely the same circumstances. I am at a loss, then, to judge what objection can be made to a motion, which I shall submit, from no motives of personality to any individual concerned, for with none am I acquainted, but solely in the spirit of fair inquiry and investigation.&#x2014;I shall endeavour, as briefly as possible, to state the particulars of this transaction. As early as the December preceding, Mr. Emmett returned from the continent, and joined a conspiracy already formed. This time of its duration, about 8 months, is farther corroborated by the proclamation found in the depot of the rebels, and which they intended to have published, had they been successful. Nothing very material transpires till his Majesty's message of the 8th of March was740known. That which spread such general gloom over the minds of every gentleman in this House, seems to have given fresh vigor to these conspirators. In the same month, in the metropolis of Ireland, under the immediate eye of government, several depots were established, and particularly one in Patrick-street, and one near Dirty-lane. The forging pikes, making pike handles, collecting blunderbusses and pistols, making up military cloathing, and other warlike preparations, continued to be made without any interruption from the government, till the 16th of July, when the depot in Patrick-street exploded. A peace officer visited this depot the day the explosion took place, and found pikes, pike handles, and preparations for making gunpowder. What the government did in consequence of a circumstance of such evident notoriety, will be for them to explain, should the House think fit to grant this inquiry; but, so alarmed was Mr. Emmett, that he immediately changed his residence, and appears during the following week, to have made every exertion to accelerate his preparations till the hour of 9 on Saturday night the 23d of July, when he is stated upon his trial, to have sallied forth avowedly for the purpose of attacking the castle of Dublin. Men, from all parts of the country, had been observed resorting to Dublin, and a large body were actually armed near the depot in Dirty-lane, before they were at all perceived by the peace officers; nor had government any intimation of this dep&#x00F4;t, which contained 8,000 pikes, and above 34,000 ball cartridges, besides other military stores.&#x2014;As a recital of all the barbarous proceedings of these rebels is unnecessary to my argument, I will proceed to examine the conduct of government. That they did not makeanypreparations, I do not assert, but shall state to the House all I know they did, and leave gentlemen, until it shall be finally ascertained by an inquiry, to draw their own inference as to their sufficiency.&#x2014;That government were repeatedly warned of their danger, by persons of great credit and respectability, there is no doubt, and I believe that in many instances, that information was most ungraciously received.&#x2014;At 3 o'clock the commander in chief is stated to have been informed of it, and the lord lieutenant proceeded soon after to the Ph&#x0153;nix Lodge to prevent giving any alarm. I mention this to prove, that thenot creating alarmwas the determination of this meeting at 3 o'clock. I have reason to think that some precautions were recommended relative to the back and the ordnance stores, and a meeting of the principal officers of the gar-741rison was also determined upon; but still, in order to avoid givingalarm,it is expressly stated, that this meeting should not take place till after dark, nor were the guards to be re-inforced till the same period. That no information was given to the mayor, is not denied, but it is asserted, that informal ion was given to Mr. Alderman Alexander, the superintending magistrate.&#x2014;Now, Sir, I am credibly informed, that Mr. Alderman Alexander actually slept out of Dublin that very night. In the absence of the lord lieutenant and a right hon. gent. who was attending his duty in Parliament, the first public officer was Mr. Marsden, the under secretary. This gentleman would of course have correspondence with other public officers, daring such an important moment. When the accounts continued to increase, it was his opinion, or rather, (to use his own words) it would be\"bandsomely done\"to reinforce the guards at the Phoenix Lodge. This the lord lieutenant, in the postscript to a letter which has appeared in the public prints acknowledges, but concludes that the commander in chief has received further intelligence.&#x2014;Now, Sir, I take this to be an unequivocal proof, that the information given to the commander in chief at 3 o'clock, did not even warrant providing additional security for the person of the first magistrate; and this I will add, that no information was given him, that was not accompanied with doubts, stating that Mr. Marsden could' neither wholly credit nor reject them.\" Such was the want of accurate information, that two hours before the rebellion broke out, their secretary could neither credit or reject the reports&#x0026; But there has been, en the part of some persons, an attempt to throw the blame on the military. The House will recollect, that at the period this transaction took place, Ireland was asserted to be in a state of perfect tranquillity. There were no acts for suspending the habeas-corpus, or for proclaiming martial law; consequently, its polite devolved upon the civil power.&#x2014;I trust it will never be asserted, that under such circumstances the military should be resorted to in the first instance. I should, on the contrary, conceive, that they were in no way responsible, unless it should be proved, that upon application from the civil power, they were not prepared. So far, I believe, from this being the case, only one magistrate acted with them, who refused to allow them to fire, alleging himself not to be within the limits of his jurisdiction, and the insurrection was quelled in Thomas-street by a military force, without the assistance of a magistrate, the officer acting in his own defence&#x2014;nor was he en-742abled to act so effectually in pursuing the rebels, as he might have done, for want of proper assistance from the civil power, but was obliged to fall back on the barracks in James street. But this part of the subject lies within a very narrow compass. If all was done that was agreed upon at 3 o'clock, and subsequently advised by the civil power, always under a positive order to avoid giving any alarm, I shall feel satisfied that the military are exculpated, and the positive of a letter received by Gen. Fox, just as the rebellion was breaking out, clearly proves that the lord lieutenant conceived he had done more than was necessary. The postscript runs thus: \"I have just heard that \"you have given directions for augmenting \"the guard here to an officer and 30 men. \"I conclude from it, that you have received \"some further intelligence, which induces \"you to think it adviseable, and as an alarm \"is given, that precaution will not add greatly to it.\"&#x2014;I might possibly be considered here, as wishing to exonerate the commander in chief. I disclaim any such intention, further than that impression which I have received from a careful investigation of the facts. But if there is any cause to blame his conduct, let that, also, be brought forward. The public have a claim upon this House for the truth of the particulars of that, transaction. It is that which I demand, and; will pledge myself, if the House thinks fit to acquiesce in this motion, to produce to them a scene of weakness and indecision, far beyond the conception of any one who hears me. I will prove a secretary writing letters unprecedented as to their equivocal meaning. I will prove him just as the rebellion broke out, writing this laconic and extraordinary epistle: \"Our accounts grow more serious. \"I am told that men are marching on the \"line of the canal. Appearances look but \"uncomfortableYours, &c.;\" This and the unsatisfactory accounts of the reports which he could neither credit or reject, were the intimations given of an insurrection that threatened to subvert the government of Ireland. I will then move for letters from the lord lieutenant, written after this barbarous and sanguinary rebellion, with an apathy and unconcern, of which nothing but the letters themselves, can give an adequate idea. Nor is there a man in this House, who possesses the warmth of honest feeling, who will not perceive with indignation, the very little anxiety which at this awful moment was manifested for the public safety. The precautions taken for the lord lieutenant will, I think, shew the insignificant opinion originally entertained of this rebellion, and form743a history of the minds of government during nine very important hours. At 3 o'clock the lord lieutenant conceived himself sufficiently guarded by a Serjeant and 13 men; between 8 and 9 hewas surprisedit should be thought necessary for him to be guarded by an officer and 30 men; and before 11, he sent orders to Sir Charles Asgill by Sir Edward Littlehales, for a further reinforcement of a captain and 50 dragoons, and a field officer and 100 infantry. I do not state this as more than necessary; en the contrary, I think the person of the first magistrate in that country should be held sacred; but I state, as a criterion of his opinion of the rebellion, and if we proportion the alarm in the minds of government to the number of men, it was just fifteen times greater at 11 o'clock than at 3, when the precautions were originally agreed upon.&#x2014;Now, in considering all these facts, I have wished to trace some principle upon which the government acted; and the only consistent part they appear to me to have held, was a determination to avoid givingalarm.It may, therefore, be necessary to say a few words on the propriety of that determination. It has always been admitted, that it is better topreventthan topunishcrimes. It is impossible the government could have intended to wait till this insurrection took place, with a view of discovering the authors; the risk which every loyal man must have you, the placing the lives of his Majesty's subjects, even for the shortest period, in such a state of danger, would of itself be deemed highly criminal, and the impropriety of such a measure cannot be more fully exemplified than in the unfortunate occurrence which actually took place.&#x2014;Hut. it has been argued, that the melancholy circumstance of Lord Kilwarden's death was \"accidental,\" the rising \"a contemptible riot.\" Can that be deemed \"contemptible,\" which had for its object the separation of Ireland, to deprive us of her valuable assistance at a moment when we were called upon to make every exertion for the very defence of these kingdoms? which was evidently undertaken in concert with the enemy, who had probably contributed to the powerful means which they had of carrying their plans into execution. Can that be called a \"contempible rior,\" which induced yon to pass bills, giving the greatest possible power to the government of that country, and after a period of months deliberately to renew them? which obliged you to place the yeomanry of Ireland on permanent duty for 3 months, at an expense of above 400,000l.to be defrayed by die two countries? No&#x0026; Sir, the government of Ireland found itself744embarrassed. To justify these strong measures, they were oliged to represent it in its true light; they then perceived that if it was important and extensive, they should have been better prepared against it, and what they call in their proclamations \"daring and rebellious outrages in prosecution of a rebellions conspiracy, \"dwindles into a\"contemptible riot.\"&#x2014;But let us not differ as to I terms. Grant a full and fair investigation. Let us have authenticated papers, and persons; at your bar. Let us have she facts, and the; appropriate name will easily be found.&#x2014;I therefore move, \"That this house do resolve itself into a commitee of the whole house to inquire into the conduct of the Irish government relative to the insurrection of the 23dof July, and the previous conduct of that government, as far as relates to the said insurrection.\"", "author_id": "/people/sir-john-wrottesley", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1804", "mar", "07"], "content": "&#x2014;Before I proceed. Sir, to753state shortly the grounds upon which I am compelled to give my vole in favor of the present motion, I feel desirous of offering a few observations on the ground which my noble friend who has just spoken has taken to oppose the present motion, a ground which might be urged against every motion that ever was made or ever will be made for any inquiry whatever in this house into the conduct of any administration; a course very well calculated to screen any government however liable to prepetual attack, and which to a government not very strong I in itself is more especially necessary for that, for many, and some of their particular reasons. It is not, in my opinion, wise to attempt to lay down any general rule to govern all cases of motions for parliamentary inquiry. The grounds in the present; case are three: two of them are of a general kind; the reason for or against the inquiry, is not to be considered as conclusive on the one side or the other, but considered from both together. Each case of proposed inquiry in this House should be I considered, not with reference to any rule that is supposed to be binding, but should be decided upon its own particular merits, It is injudicious to say that inquiries in this House are at all times improper, or at all times I to be indulged, but the House will judge in; each case as it appears before it, will judge when the topics are brought before it, whether the facts complained of are justly so complained of, and therefore ought to be inquired into, or whether they are assumed facts, and not to be considered; whether, in short, the accusation is justly made, or wantonly made; whether the resistance to it is made with a sense of the integrity of; the parties accused, and of the merit of their case, or brought forward to prevent its vile-ness and rottenness from being searched, and proceeds from an unwillingness to expose it.&#x2014;My noble friend who now resists the present inquiry has not been sparing in his general topics, but has urged them with a plainness of colouring I hardly ever noticed before. What has may noble friend said against the inquiry now proposed? That it I will take up the time, the valuable time of Parliament. Undoubtedly it will do so. But how is the time of Parliament, valuable as it is, to be applied at all&#x2014;is it not in the exercise of the most important functions of Parliament And what are these important functions&#x2014;what but that of looking into the conduct of its government, to see whether the people are well or ill governed; to see whether those who act in the government are deserving of confidence or not? How754can this be known when complaints are most seriously exhibited, and offered to be proved, without an inquiry into the truth or the falsehood of such complaints? How can there be any confidence for the future, unless there is satisfaction as to the past? I must say, that the arguments offered in opposition to the present motion come with a peculiarly ill grace from the mouth of my noble friend.&#x2014;Sir, I voted for the union between this country and Ireland. I was then an English member of Parliament; since that union I have sat here as an Irish member, and I will now ask, how it is possible for this House, the great bulk of which consists of English members, to refuse to inquire into a matter so generally interesting to the empire at large, and so particularly interesting to Ireland? Or, am I to be told that I tricked Ireland, when I gave my vote for the union, as a member of Parliament for England?&#x2014;That the valuable time of Parliament should now be taken up in the discussion of this subject is, in my opinion, highly proper, for had it not been for the union, the subject would have been long ago discussed in Ireland&#x2014;in that House, at the door of which, some of the outrages in question were committed. The very House in which the members would have assembled, had nearly been a scene of action. They would there have most assuredly instituted an inquiry, whether they had or had not been properly defended by the executive government? But if the inquiry now proposed is to be refused on the ground that the valuable time of Parliament is not to be taken up with this matter; if this is to be the specimen of attention&#x2014;this the sample of diligence&#x2014;this the scale of vigilance by which the anxiety of Parliament for the welfare of Ireland is to be measured,. I must repent of the vote I gave, as an English member, for the union, and now, as an Irish member, protest against this apathy in the House towards the interests of Ireland. Such must be my feeling, and such my sentiment if this inquiry is to be refused. I must repent of what I did as an English member before the union, and in my present capacity of an Irish member, complain that Ireland has not her fair share of your attention.&#x2014;But not only is this motion supposed to be improper, on account of the valuable time of Parliament which would be taken up by it, but it is improper also, because the valuable attention of my Lord Hardwicke would be taken up by it; and it is asked how the government of Ireland is to go on, if this motion is carried, for then he will be compelled to come over to this coun-755try for his defence? And here, Sir, I must disclaim every thing personal in the present motion: the noble personage supposed to be the most interested in it, I have no knowledge of, otherwise than from the government of which he is the chief magistrate. I have no knowledge of my Lord Hardwicke. I never saw him, nor ever heard of him but as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. I beg leave to say, that I am not to be understood to intend any thing personally disrespectful to that noble lord; I speak of him merely in his official capacity on this occasion: but sti11 when the question is whether he has governed Ireland well or ill, I must be allowed to speak ray mind freely, nor will I take the plea in bar which has been offered to this inquiry by my noble friend, that the noble lord has no time to defend his conduct. What if he be obliged to come away from Ireland? What if he be a valuable chief magistrate? \"I hope we have within the land five hundred good as he.\" I see no absolute necessity for his remaining in Ireland. If he has incurred the suspicion of Parliament, I see no reason why he should not be recalled and brought before this Parliament to make his defence, and another appointed in the office which he now holds. It may be urged, that this course would be indecorous towards the noble lord, but I would ask whether a similar delicacy has been observed in other instances? Has it been observed with regard to General Fox? Has it not been thought necessary to recal General Fox, even although it is admitted now that there was no objection to him?&#x2014;And why, if the lord lieutenant has incurred the suspicion of Parliament, should not he also be recalled? It is now plainly admitted, that there was no objection whatever to the conduct of that gallant officer, and yet he was recalled, know not by what chain of necessity Lord Hardwicke is so bound to the office of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, that however he may be accused, he cannot come home to defend himself.&#x2014;As to the arguments of my noble friend in bar of inquiry, he seems to have rested them upon three different grounds: 1st, that the government of Ireland had ample, information; 2d, that the danger of the day was not so great as it has been represented; and 3dly. (aground which has no relation to the mot on) that since the surprize into which government was thrown upon that occasion, government has been vigilant. Now if I were to admit the truth of this last ground of justification; it I were to admit, in its full force, the as senior, that from the moment of riot, or756whatever it was proper to call it, on the 23d of July, government has been the most vigorous, vigilant, and active that ever existed, yet no part of the accusation upon which this motion is founded would have been answered, for this motion is founded upon an allegation that they did not use proper precautions before and on the 23d of July; the motion has no reference to any thing which has happened since that period Now, it is complained of as a thing improper, that a better prospect has been held forth on the subject of the tranquillity and happiness of Ireland than ought to have been, or than the real state of things would warrant; and upon these topics my noble friend says that he has stated his opinion with no particular emphasis, but that what he said on that occasion was to be taken with shades and qualifications.&#x2014;Now, Sir my complaint is that these shades and qualifications, with which subsequent speeches of my noble friend a bounded, were never made when the assertion of the tranquillity and happiness of Ireland was made. But when that assertion is complained of as being refuted by facts, then my noble friend turns round and products his shades and qualifications of what he said. This reminds me of the statement ma e by the Chancellor of the Exchequer last sessions, relative to the state of profound peace, in which that right hon. gent. then represented Ireland. He insisted upon it that when he talked formerly of a peace he did not mean profound peace: but that the words \"profound\" and 'peace\" were so apt to come together. Why they go together, I know not, unless, indeed, that they both begin with a P.&#x2014;Now, I expect that ministers will deal fairly with Parliament; I am of opinion that the words of ministers, especially when they are prospective, should be weighed well before they are delivered, for I do not understand the idea that men are to be called \"nature's fools,\" for having believed the words of a minister; or that it should be thrown in their teeth that \"none but fools could believe them.\" Now, the House is asked why they did not bung with them, when they believed the assertion that Ireland was likely to be tranquil and harpy, these shades and qualifications to accompany their belief, so as to be prepared for what has actually happened? But these were not loose or vague assertions, they were the serious assertions of a gentleman well qualified to make them, and for that reason likely to obtain credit for them when made, from the great advantage he is well known to possess by local knowledge, and therefore it is not matter of won-757der that the House of Commons gave that assertion credit.&#x2014;But my noble friend has said that upon the explosion in Patrick Street, government began to think that all was not right. Now, that explosion was on the l6th of July; the insurrection took, place on the 23d. Here is a period of a week during which nothing was done; no precaution was taken by this \"wise, vigilant, and provident government,\" notwithstanding this abundant reason for precaution. The explosion happened on the l6th, which ought to have put ministers on their guard, nothing, however, was done until the 23d. On the 23d the insurrection takes place, and then, but not till then, government thinks of measures of precaution. Now, I mast say, that if ministers did not believe there was danger after the 16th; if they could not see it, there must be an extreme blindness; if, seeing it, they did not provide against it, there was an extreme and culpable remissness. My noble friend found this a pinching part of the case, and therefore he took tile usual course of very ingenious men upon such occasions: instead of meeting the thing itself, he endeavoured to call the attention of the House off from it, to another, namely, the supposed misinterpretation of his opponent, for he has said the number of pikes, were not 8,000 as had been erroneously stated, and 50 considerably exaggerated on the other side, but that they were only between 3 and 4,000. Now, my noble friend ought to be correct upon this subject, because he has the best means of obtaining information; and when he made his statement, and endeavoured to divert the attention of the House to that which was not the truth, or from pursuing that which was the truth, he ought to have taken care that he was accurate in his fact?. And here I do not accuse my noble friend of an attempt wilfully to mislead the House; but I must say, he has some way or other failed to obtain correct information; upon this very subject in which he has been correcting the hon. bart. in his statement, he is glaringly incorrect in his own. hold in my hand a pamphlet, admitted, I believe, on all sides, to be pretty good authority, in which the fact upon the subject of the pikes, which my noble friend says, were only between 3 and 4,000, is stated so directly the contrary, and so entirely refutes the statement of the noble lord, that I shall beg leave to read a passage out of it. This pamphlet states, \"that the rebels had on this occasion 36,400 ball-cartridges, scaling ladders, pikes, rebel uniforms, &c.; and colours. 8,000 copies of a proclamation of the provisional government, &c.; \"and758that with regard to pikes,\" the mob having been supplied from the depot with arms, &c.; there then remained the trilling number of between 6 and 7,000 pikes, &c.;\" But shall I be allowed to bring forward this assertion against that of his Majesty's confidential servants? I trust I shall. And that the House may see on what authority this pamphlet rests, I will state who the author of it is. It is not a speculative or vague opinion of an individual who had no source of information on the subject on which he treated, but a grave document of perfect authority, no less than the speech of his Majesty's Attorney-General in Ireland, on the trial of Emmett; upon the accuracy of which I apprehend ministers themselves will not affect to entertain a doubt. It has of late become the fashion in this country to rundown the Attorney-General's law; but I ask ministers, if they are ready, in like manner, to run down the Attorney-General's facts? My noble friend has stated, that there were only 3 or 4,000 pikes belonging to the rebels discovered. The Attorney-General in his speech addressed to the jury, the object of which was to persuade them to sited blood, says, I that the number of pikes, after those who had been discovered in arms had been supplied was between 6 and 7,000&#x0026; Now my noble friend shall take his choice. Did my noble friend make a wrong apology for the Irish govt. in stating the number of these pikes too low; or was this prisoner, against whom this speech was opened, and who was convicted upon the proof of it, hanged upon a falsehood? Perhaps it may be said, that the speech of the Attorney General was an exaggerated statement of the facts; but I should think that a man in so grave an office, on so I grave a subject; a man I do not, indeed, know personally, but of whom I have always heard much to his advantage as a professional man, and a man of honour, would not have exaggerated at all, for it was certainly a case in which he should say nothing but what was strictly correct, because it was a matter in which his fellow creature was to be deprived of his existence. Now, if that learned gent. did speak the truth on that most solemn occasion, my noble friend has been deceived in the amount of the arms of the rebels, and, consequently, in the amount also of the danger to which Ireland was exposed on the 23d of July. But there are two ways of stating things in an argument, with both of which my noble friend is perfectly well acquainted, and of which he is always well aware: the one is to slate and to prove by facts; the other is to state a general result of assumed facts, and to prove nothing. My759noble friend has taken the latter course, as most suitable to the case on which he was discoursing. He also claimed merit to the government for things in which they had no concern in producing. He told the house that the bank had a strong wall, which I imagine will hardly be considered as a proof of the precaution and the vigilance of government. And as to the castle, although he admitted it would have been disgraceful it should have been occupied by rebels, he says, that if they had entered it in Triumph, they would yet have found nothing in it. I hope ministers do not mean to invert this and say, that if they had entered the bank they would have found nothing there too. But, surely, there is something in impression I upon such an occasion as that of which I am now speaking. There is much to be considered in governing a people of high and quick feelings, and strong attachments; and, therefore, if the bank or the castle had fallen into the hands of the rebels, if either the castle or the bank had been surprized, and taken, even if there had been nothing&#x0026; of value in either, it would have, had a very bad effect on the feelings of the people of Ireland.&#x2014;I shall not follow my noble friend in the papers and minutes to which he referred, but all I can say is, that the statement did not strike me as having much in it. I may be wrong; ray noble friend may be right; but nobody knows which of us is right; therefore,&#x2014;what? therefore let the house inquire; for that will be infinitely better than to depend upon assertions, unsupported by proof, in the speech of any minister, however respectable he may be as an individual.&#x2014;I have shewn that my noble friend has suffered himself to be misled by defective information in one striking instance, and his other assertions may proceed from the same defective source. It has been said that the assertions of those who brought forward this subject were exaggerated. It has been said, and in one instance already proved, that the states merits on the other side are fallacious; there fore let the house no longer rest on exaggerated statements on the one hand, or false construction or defective information on the other, but let the house see the facts as they really are. It is evident from the pamphlet which I have already quoted, and which I shall beg permission to quote again, that the insurrection of the 23d of July was the consequence of a preconcerted conspiracy; it was a plan instigated by treason, by persons united together by one common bond of crimes, and insurrection was the consequence of their united efforts. But, whatever might be the degree of danger on the 23d of July, it is rather a curious defence to say,760that precaution has been taken since that day. I shall not delay the House by giving the clerk the trouble of reading the motion, but I believe it referred only to transactions previous to and on the 23d of July.&#x2014;But another curious defence set up by ray noble friend is, that it was a very dark night on the 23d of July&#x2014;a very dark night indeed&#x0026; Now, if the question had not been, whether government were prepared, but whether their preparations were well executed that night, the darkness of the night or the difficulties of wind and weather, would be an excuse as far as it would go; but although the darkness of the night prevented ministers fromseeing,it could not have prevented them fromforeseeing.I do not see why the darkness of the night could li3ve made ministers blind at least a week previous to that time; and I can not help observing further, that though the darkness was so great that it was impossible to know what passed that night, yet my noble friend has stated that the number of rebels in the street that night was 80. But how did you count them? How that fact could be ascertained when it was too dark to see any thing, is beyond my comprehension&#x0026; The effect of this darkness was most singular. It made men blind before it happened, and enabled them to see during its continuance. But, in point of fact, I would ask, whether the insurrection was so contemptible as has been slated, and made only by a contemptible mob in Dublin? T apprehend not: for upon the authority of a character high in office, and in the confidence of the Irish government (lord Redesdale), it has been stated, that persons had assembled from all parts of Ireland on the occasion, and it has been made the ground of a charge against three-fourths of the population of Ireland, that they had chosen and furnished their quota of these rebels;&#x2014;that is, that three-fourths of the people of Ireland, furnished their quota of 80 men, since that was the whole number, according to the statement of my noble friend. All the Catholics are by this same high authority, implicated in the rebellion, and have their share of the guilt imputed to them. I allude to the documents, which I have read with shame and indignation, and when I heard my noble friend talk of the temper and moderation of the Irish government, I did expect&#x0026; that it would have been shewn that their I conduct had been such as to remove every distinction, to prevent the recurrence of those differences that have so long disturbed the peace and tranquillity of that country. If that has been the policy, as I am sure it was the duty of government, ill, indeed, has that end been endeavoured to be accomplished&#x0026; Good761God&#x0026; Sir, that in the 19tb century, there should be found a man of great talents, fitted for great good in a state; of great learning too, but that which he has lately displayed, I could almost have wished that no body had it now, for I had hoped it had been exploded at least two centuries ago;&#x2014;that this learned person should till the office of a great legislator, and the highest as a legal magistrate, cud that he should be appointed to preside in, the only country where such antiquated doctrine could do effectual mischief&#x0026; I do not I say it is a fault, but it certainly is a great misfortune that such a person, with such sentiments, should be placed in such a station. I cannot augur favourably of the disposition of a government, in which such sentiments prevail nor do I think it likely that Ireland can ever be tranquillized, as long as they shall be acted upon. I cannot think it likely that those pictures of quietness, contentment, and happiness, which have been so gratuitously afforded to the House, and so diligently laid before it, that the rebellion was at an end for ever, that the principle on which it was fomented was destroyed, that Ireland was, by the rooting out of prejudices, become one body of harmony in temper and united in object will ever be realized, if the policy is to be that to which I have just alluded. Jam willing to give government credit for their intention to do away all animosity in Ireland. I do not mean to say that the correspondence to which I allude is to be considered, nor do I state it, as a fire-brand which threatens the country with destruction, but I do state, that great officer, as enjoying the full confidence and a great portion of the power of government, and whether he was the intended vehicle of publishing such sentiments I do not know, yet it has all the effect of design, and I cannot help looking upon the publication of such sentiments as conveying to the public theanimusof government. Whether these sentiments are really the sentiments of the government, or no, I will not pretend to say, but the great character to whom I have alluded is a member of the Irish government; and the government in winch such a mind predominates&#x2014;that is to say, a mind governed by such principles as have been published by that I great person who had great influence&#x2014;where such a spirit presides&#x2014;and where such a spirit rules, and such opinions are cherished, the government, influenced by it, I am sure, cannot be conciliating, nor agreeable, nor can it held forth any prospect of comfort, to say nothing of happiness, to the Irish people; a government which permits itself to cherish such sentiments, discovers ananimus762that affords no comfort to those who are governed; it is an imprudent government, and very ill adapted for the safety of the public&#x2014;As to the vigilance of the Irish government now, when they have been roused by two explosions, that appears to me as no reason why the present inquiry should not be gone into. With respect to the manner in which the affairs of Ireland were neglected previous to and on the 23d of July, I contend, that the negligence of government was so great, as not to keep on their stations the most important officers of state. Mr. Wickham, a gentleman who from his station and talent might have rendered essential service to Ireland, at the time of the insurrection, had not been desired to remain on his post, but was on an excursion of pleasure, and actually in Yorkshire when, the first intelligence reached him of the insurrection in Ireland but, however, no blame attaches to this gent, upon this occasion; it only makes the accusation the more weighty on those who ought to bear it. No consideration of the weight of personal responsibility on any body ought to induce the House to neglect its duty, which I apprehend it will do, if it declines entering into the present inquiry. I see no inconvenience likely to arise from this investigation that can be put into the scale and weighed against the public benefit likely to result from it. I hate the greatest esteem for my noble friend, and the highest opinion of his talents and abilities, but I am so entirely dissatisfied with his arguments upon this occasion, that I shall most certainly vote for the present motion.", "author_id": "/people/mr-george-canning", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1804", "mar", "07"], "content": "&#x2014;Sir; I beg the attention of the House to a few observations which I am desirous of submitting to their consideration respecting the present motion. I am not a roan who wishes to imitate any other man's manner, nor follow any other man's sentiments. I rise at present partly to offer my acknowledgements to the right hon. gent. who has just sat down, for the great attention he has paid to Ireland, and for the lively interest with which he seems on the present occasion to be impressed in favour of that part of the united empire. After having said thus much, I hope I may be allowed to doubt whether any of the good purposes, intended to be obtained by the motion, are likely to be the result of it. The hon. baronet who brought it forward said, in one part of his speech, that he did not know why the hon. admiral, who originally brought it forward, had given up she question I believe, I can tell him: and my opinion is, that he meant to clear up the763character of a very good and meritorious officer, which he thought had been wounded by the manner in winch he had been obliged to leave Ireland, but which he has since found, from the most unequivocal and repeated declarations of his Majesty's ministers, was not in any respect impeached by them, nor did any one of them ever entertain, for a moment, the least thought that was not highly honourable to that gallant and deserving officer.&#x2014;I think the motion assumes also more than it ought to do. It assumes, in the first place, that the Irish government has not done its duty; and, 2dly, that this is the best time forgoing into an inquiry on the subject. I cannot see the matter at all in this light. I see nothing in the conduct of the Irish government, on the 23d of July, that is, in any degree, so extraordinary as many hon. gentlemen would endeavour to represent it. Many other governments besides this, have at former periods been in equally unfortunate circumstances. I think I can in my own person remember to have seen a much larger city than Dublin, which was also the metropolis of a much more extensive country, in a state of conflagration for several successive days, when her prisons were in broad-day thrown open, and burned to the ground; private houses marked out for pillage and devastation, and its high court of Parliament actually sitting during the whole time, and this done by an infatuated and drunken multitude, not confined to a few hundreds, as was the case in Dublin, but amounting to at least 40 000; and yet no mention has ever been made of calling for an inquiry into the conduct of I he government of that country to which I allude. It. is very possible, I think, that secret meetings may take place without government becoming acquainted with them. I agree with the right hon. gent., that the death of Lord Kilwarden has given a melancholy aspect to this affair, and has caused an infinite, deal of blame to be thrown on the Irish government which it does not merit. It is, I allow, an event deeply to be deplored; and I should be the last man in the world who would mean to say any thing in extenuation of murder; but I wish the matter should not be exaggerated, in order to throw an additional degree of odium on the government. How can it be supposed that 400 of the mob of Dublin, half drunk, should be capable of putting to a risque the security and safety of the metropolis, guarded at the same moment by a garrison amounting to 4000 disciplined regular forces.&#x2014;My arguments on a former occasion, respecting the state of Ireland,764have been adverted to, as describing that country in a different situation to what it had at a subsequent period of no great distance of time, turned out to be. I then said, that in my opinion, \"if the French should land there, every loyal man would join to oppose them from patriotism, and every Jacobin would do the same from the principle of revenge.\" think what I then delivered as my own sentiments have been since very folly illustrated and proved by the declaration of Emmett, who is generally allowed to have/been the most enthusiastic of all the rebel leaders. On his trial, he expressly declared, that if the French were to land, he would oppose them to the utmost with fire and sword. This declaration has been fully confirmed by that of I Russell, who, though not so enthusiastic, was reckoned the most steady of all the rebel chiefs.&#x2014;I beg leave to say but one word more, and that is, on the allusion that has been made to the correspondence between: the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, and the Earl of Fingal. I regret that this correspondence I has been brought before the public; and I cannot help thinking, that next to the impropriety of publishing those letters, that of I bringing them into discussion in this place, or indeed, I might say, in any place whatever, is the most to be deprecated. I cannot, however, agree with the right hon. gent, that these letters discover what he terms the animus of government. I do not conceive that government is, or ought to be supposed answerable for the conduct of judicial characters. The great personage who ins been alluded to, only acted as Lord Chancellor, and if he has in his judicial character mixed any thing that is political in its; tendency, it might, perhaps, be wished that he had not done so; for it strikes me, that judicial characters should interfere, as little, as possible, with politics. Such an interference may often be inconvenient and seldom useful: still, however, I contend, that it is no proof of any particular animus in the government, nor ought the government to be answerable for it.

{"date": ["1804", "mar", "07"], "content": "&#x2014;Sir; I beg the indulgence of the House while I offer a few short and temperate observations. The situation in which I was placed in Ireland, enables me to form an accurate judgment. I was placed upon the Irish staff in last spring, but I was pot ordered to join till after the explosion of the rebellion on the 23d of July. I then lost no time in repairing to Ireland. On my arrival in Dublin, some days had elapsed, and the transaction of the. 23d of July began to be viewed in different lights. I had opportunities of conversing with all parties, wish the military officers, the commander in chief, the chief secretary, the officers of the volunlunteers, in short, with all those who were best enabled to furnish me with the means of forming an opinion, and the genera impression of all I heard was, that the Irish government was taken by surprise.&#x2014;If the773House goes into the inquiry, it will be found whether, in fact, it was so or not; but I confess that was the impression made on my mind. From what has come out on the trials, which Mr. Wickham directed in the best manner, I am sure he was convinced, with me, that government was surprised. I will ask, if a powder mill had exploded at Charing-cross, and no measures were taken by Sir R. Ford to obtain information about it, would rot every ore be surprised? The explosion in Patrick street was as near to the Cattle; is Charing cross to this House, or to St. James's; and active inquiry might have been the means of preventing the insurrection an blood shed of the 23d July With respect to the hon. officer (Gen. Fox), the intelligence d not reach-him till it was too late. Is it, otherwise, to be supposed that he would have put off the council of war, which he held in consequence, to so late an hour, that one of the officers who attended at it, was obliged to return back, the insurrection having already commenced, and the ether found his safety in having a good pair of legs, (which it is often very useful to have on such occasions) and being acquainted with the bye-ways. The noble lord dwelt much on the strength of a garrison of 4000 men, and conceived the Bank to be particularly secure, from being placed between the royal barracks and the 62d reg. On speaking with the Col. of the 62d reg., I was informed, that the orders reached him so late, find from such a variety of quarters, that he could collect only 16 men in any sufficient time. The same officer informed me of the situation of a dep&#x00D4;t of powder, of which he informed Mr. Sec. Wickham, but that dep&#x00D4;t was not discovered till after the rebellion, the ramifications of which were very extensive. I heard at Naas, the capital of the county of Kildare, that information had been conveyed from thence to government, but that it had been little attended to. I found that the conspiracy also extended to the south beyond Cork, where the conspirators learned, by means of telegraphic fires, the ill success of the insurrection in Dublin, before the King's officers knew it in Cork. It was by this information only that the insurrection was prevented from being general over the country. I do not think that Gen. Fox, an officer who has done most meritorious service from a very early age, should be deprived of a command, superior in importance to every other in the service, without any reason being assigned for that privation. It was a command of much difficulty and danger, but there was the more room for reaping glory if the enemy should come. On774these grounds I conceive the inquiry to be loudly called for.", "author_id": "/people/mr-banastre-tarleton", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1804", "mar", "07"], "content": "&#x2014;Sir; I should have contented myself with offering but a very few arguments in favour of the motion of the horn bart., but some of the remarks of the right hon. gent, who has just sat down will compel me to go a little more into detail than I intended, and to preface what I intend to say, with a few preliminary observations. In some respects the right hon. gent, and myself are plated is similar situations. He has the same feelings towards one of the parties, whose name his been so often mentioned in this discussion, as I have for the other. There is another* point of similarity in regard to our wishes on the subject of this inquiry, in which, indeed, he gees beyond me: he says that lord Hard-779wicke is desirous to have his conduct canvassed. My hon. relation does not go quite so far: he only has no objection to the inquiry. The right hon. gent, says, he will not oppose the inquiry: here indeed I go beyond him, for I will vole for the inquiry. He may be, and no doubt is, a much better member of Parliament, and a much better statesman; but in promoting this inquiry, I consider myself the better brother of the two. It is true, however, that when the right hon. gentleman said, that personally he would not oppose the inquiry, he took care immediately to correct himself, well aware, probably of the influence which such a declaration from him might have on many in this House; and while he avowed a wish for inquiry himself, he seemed anxious to shew, that to others who were in a less delicate situation, no parliamentary ground li3d been stated for the motion. And here I feel myself obliged to state that kind of complaint which I have frequently been under the necessity of making, against the practice of men in office resisting an inquiry, by employing arguments, founded on partial extracts from papers and documents, not in the possession or perhaps within the reach of other members. Such partial extracts generally contain only what is in favour of the ministerial argument, while every thing of a contrary tendency, or which could explain the parts that are insisted upon, are altogether withheld. The justice of this complaint of mine, receives a most forcible illustration from the example of this night. Respecting the anxious wish of exciting no alarm, so often ascribed to the lord lieut., the right hon. gent, says, \"How do I know, as a member of Parliament, that so much stress bag been laid by the lord lieut. on giving no alarm?\" To this I say, that however ignorant he may be as a member of Parliament, he cannot be ignorant of the fact, that, on this point, no more stress has been laid than the documents fully justify. I take upon me to say, that as an individual do know that the cord lieut. must have been exceedingly anxious on this head; for though out the correspondence, of which the right hon. gent, has read us what he thought useful for himself, the sentiments occur over and over again. They may defend the lord lieut. for his feel lag; but let them not attempt to deny its existence. Let us, then, have the whole of die papers laid before us, or let us have none of them. It will then be impossible to give false gloss by garbled extracts, and, upon a consideration of the whole, the House will we able to judge and decide. I am confident lit they must then see that the utmost780anxiety to avoid alarm prevailed in lord Hardwicke's mind; and that he disbelieved, totally disbelieved, the intelligence which had been communicated of an impending disturbance.&#x2014;As the right hon. gent, considered himself obliged to advert to certain facts, in which he felt a personal interest, I mast be indulged in following his example; but first I must remark on what another hon. gent said, as to the notices which have been given on this subject. He says that an hen. relation of mine gave notice of a motion respecting the late commander in chief in Ireland and that I had likewise given notice of a motion. In lilts he is mistaken; for I always felt, that however I might be gratified in supporting this, or any motion of a more personal nature, I was not the most proper person to bring the business before the House. My hon. relation (admiral Berkeley) said, that if it should be stated to the House by ministers that no blame was imputed to gen. Fox, then it was not the wish, of that officer, that any inquiry should be gone into on his account. This the right hon. gent, thought fit to state; and of course the motion of my hon. relation fell to the ground. If, however, the government here, as in Ireland, are still disposed to defend themselves by imputing that blame to my hon. relation, late the commander in chief in Ireland, the infamy is theirs, and he stands acquitted. Here let me ask, however, whether lord Hardwicke, as well as ministers here, has acquitted gen. Fox, and ceased to defend himself by imputing blame to that gallant officer? Let us lock at the conduct of the Irish government and we must be convinced that they have not. The right hon. gent, says, that a coolness arose between the lord heat, and the commander in chief, and it was impossible that both could remain in the offices they held. Bat when did this coolness arise? I assert that this coolness did not arise till many days after the affair of the 23d, and that a perfect good understanding continued between them. But when accounts came from England, stating the impression made by that affair in this country, and when the lord lieutenant, perhaps to, his second surprise, found that every body was crying out against the Irish government for having been surprised, then, perhaps, it was insinuated to him by those around him, that the best way to defend himself was to blame others, and that the disgrace of the commander in chief would screen the castle from ail censure. Something of this kind seems to have been the progress, if we can judge from the effect. From that moment, indeed a coolness did exist, and the com-781mander in chief did resign, because he knew that it was the wish of the lord lieut that he should do so; and in such circumstances my hon. relation, feeling that he could not serve he public usefully, did resign; but, surely, that was a very different thing from a voluntary resignation, and it must have been considered so by the world. What then was to be the effect of such a resignation? If the lord lieutenant of Ireland was so ignorent of the ways of mankind, and of the modes of thinking, as to imagine that, at such a moment, to signify a wish for the resignation of the commander in chief was not to give an impression unfavourable to the latter, could he believe that the world would fail to conclude that the commander in chief was dismissed because his conduct was disapproved:&#x2014;But to shew that the system of attacking my hon. relation is still pursued as the only means of defending the Irish government, I will produce two articles which have been published in the Dublin journal. But first let me ask, will ministers, and gent, connected with Ireland, deny that the Dublin newspapers, particularly the newspaper, are under the influence of government. Will they deny that the conductors of that journal would venture to insert paragraphs disagreeable to the castle? If may not be the case, perhaps, that the Irish newspaper are so much under the control of government as the. Paris journals are under that of the French government; but will it be pretended that she Irish government does not influence the Dublin paper? and particularly that called \"Faulkner's journal?\" No one will deny this, and the conclusion drawn from what I am about to read, I think is equally undeniable,&#x2014;Here Mr. Fox read a paragraph from the Dublin journal, of the 14th Feb., respecting admiral Berkeley having given up his motion in consequence of what. Mr. Yorke said respecting general Fox. It stated in most abusive terms, that blame existed somewhere, and that if ministers were not obliged to resist such motion, from the inconvenience with which in won be attended, she result would fully justify, and prove unfavourable to general Fox. He then read a paragraph in the Dublin journal of the 18th Feb., again reflecting on gen. Fox, and contrasting his conduct with what Lord Cathcart's would have been, and stating the different consequences; at the same time stating, that though the death of Lord Kilwarden, &c.; would not have taken place, the country would have lost the benefit which had arisen from the disclosure of rebellion, and from782the example of the pure and admirable dispensations of criminal justice.&#x2014;Indeed, two more scurrilous and abusive paragraphs, continued Mr. Fox, cannot be conceived. When I see such paragraphs published in the journal of the castle, what am I to conclude? Had the first of these paragraphs I been disagreeable to the castle, is it to be credited that the slightest notice of disapprobation would not have prevented the repetition? It is impossible in fairness then to deny, that the Irish government does endeavour to defend itself by attempting to blacken the character of the commander in chief. From this, however, two material inferences are to be drawn. The first is a personal one, and it is clear that the recal of general Fox was intended to imply a charge of misconduct on that officer, and in this view the attack on my right hon. relation is pursued up to this moment. The next is of a public nature, and it is, that the Irish government are aware that their defence is utterly untenable, unless they are permitted to throw the blame, which exists somewhere, on Gen. Fox. They cannot deny that things are not right, but they would fain have it thought that they are not wrong.&#x2014;But an hon. gent. (Mr. Dawson), thinks that he has a triumphant argument against the motion, because no Irish member came forward to make it. Having had that hon. Gent. with me on the question of the union, it may, perhaps, be a good answer to him to say, that one of the objections; to the union here was, that it would tend to increase the influence of the crown in this House, and then it was prophesied, that of the 100 Irish members not one would be found to bring forward any charge against I ministers. The prophecy, in this instance, seem? pretty nearly realized. But, since no Irish member has thought proper to move the inquiry, we see that the Dublin journal, I with inferior authority, indeed, states that the subject deserves inquiry, and the only objection to it is the inconvenience it might occasion to ministers at this critical moment. Now, the call for inquiry even of the Dublin journal, is important in every way; either as it speaks what is agreeable to the sense and feeling of a part of the people of Ireland; or as it speaks the sense of the castle, which in the newspapers it influences, admits that blame lies somewhere. To discover and to decide where that blame really does lie now remains for Parliament.&#x2014;The hon. baronet, who opened his motion which so much ability and good sense, asserts, and offers to prove the various facts, My hon.783friend who spoke lately (Gen. Tarleton) has likewise stated many important facts. But to these it is said by the right Hon. gent., they are all hearsay. Why, to be sure, they are hearsay, and what other ground has Parliament to proceed upon in the first instance but hearsay: and what else can we have but hearsay, unless the House will resolve to inquire? There has been some criticism employed by the right hon. gent, on the word \"surprised\" as applied to the Irish government en the 23d. After what had been admitted almost by every person who had spoke, I did not expect to hear any dispute as to this point. Surprise may net necessarily imply blame. The greatest generals have been surprised. If the Irish government bad fairly said, we have had sc many false alarms, so much false information, that in ibis instance we have been surprised this defence might, perhaps, has been admitted. But they were not \"surprised\" I have always considered surprise to signify being taken unprepared. If then the Irish government had information at o'clock, and were taken unprepared at 9, I must still think they were surprised, and they are the more inexcusable if they did receive information and did not act upon it. This circumstance renders it more disgraceful, more unseemly, to be taken unprepared. To be surprised may in such circumstances be a great crime. Indeed, to be surprised is prima facie evidence of neglect. If a ship is lost a court of inquiry is held, because the rule is that a ship ought not to be lost \"without an inquiry into the case, and this when there is not the slightest reason to suppose blame.&#x2014;But there is something prima facie, which demands examination. The fact of the government of a great country being surprised, as that of Ireland was on the 23d of July, is of itself that prima facie evidence of neglect 53 would fully justify inquiry.&#x2014;With respect to the precautions adopted, let us see what they were. It may not be amiss, however, to notice the extraordinary defence set up for the lord lieutenant against the government, so extraordinary that it is altogether inconsistent with common sense. It is said that communications were made by the lord lieutenant to General Fox, and a letter written on the 18th, acquainting him of the explosion of the powder-mill or magazine on the 16th. The fact is, that General Fox had been absent on a military tour. He arrived in Dublin late on the 21st, so that he did not receive the letter and communicated papers till that day. But, in truth., what is it to784have communicated such intelligence with out adding the view in which the matter appeared to them on the spot, and whose business it was to examine such matters. It is perfectly well known, that to communicate a mass of papers without pointing out the mode in which the circumstances they state may or may not be founded, according to previous information or observation, is communicating just nothing at all, and is worse than no intelligence. Next day, the 22d, the lord lieutenant wrote to General Fox, saying there was nothing new, and expressing a wish that the General would call at the lodge on Saturday upon his other business. Nothing was said or written to enable General Fox, who had been absent, to judge what importance was attached to the explosion of the 10th. Of what use, in God's name, was it to send such communication, unless the commander in chief was expected to do something on it? And had he any reason to suppose that the government expected he should do any thing? The informant ion of Mr. Clarke, on Thursday, though; afterwards repeated on Friday, should have; been communicated to General Fox with the weight that belonged to it. But nothing was done that indicated that government attached importance to the information they had received, or expected the commander in chief to do any thing in consequence of it. Is it then fair to say, that the commander in chief had the same information as lord Hardwicke? The latter had been more than two years in Ireland. He had an opportunity of observing the state and the sentiments of the people, and had 60,OOOl. a year to spend in secret service money, to I procure intelligence. He was able there-: fore, or ought to have been able, to discriminate information, and to distinguish true from false. The commander in chief had been in Ireland only about six weeks. He had been absent on a military tour, and had no secret service money to facilitate information, nor was it his business to attend to the I detail and examination of its results How, then, was Gen. Fox to know whether the information received was important, but from the impression it made on those in the habit receiving and criticizing it? When he saw that no information was sent to the lord mayor of the intended rising, that the lord lieut. went to the Phoenix Park, unless indeed for the purpose of leaving it empty, and that the rebels should find nothing in it, how could he imagine that the information was of a serious nature? what else could he I have concluded, than that Lord Hardwick?785did not believe the intelligence received? The right hon. gent, has read a letter from the lord Heat, to Gen. Fox, written on the evening of Saturday. At first I thought that the letter must contain something which shewed that the lord lieut believed that a serious rising would take place: but, in fact, it states nothing more than that the lord lieut. had received a communication from Col. Aylmer, and which neither the Col. himself, nor Lord Hardwick seemed to attach much credit to. In fact, if the lord lieut. did believe that a rising W3S 10 take place, why did he leave the Castle and go to the Phoenix Park? Surely, if there was danger, his presence at the seat of govt. would have given confidence to the loyal, and have in pried vigor into the operations of the civil and military power. Was the Phoenix Park his proper station if he believed that danger approached? But his courage and magnanimity induced him to quit the Castle How What courage, what magnanimity? If there was danger, his leaving the Castle and going to the Lodge was not courage, but either the grossest ignorance or the most culpable temerity. What merit could there be in personal courage that led him from a station where he was safe and useful, to a place where he could be of no service, and where, if an attack had been made, he might have fallen into the hands of the rebels, without the merit of defending his post, and periling in the defence of his country? The state of Dublin on that day presents a moat lamentable picture of a city deserted by all the efficient members of its government; and if danger was apprehended, never was conduct so unaccountable. The lord lieut. quits the Castle, and retires to his villa &#x0026; The commander in chief goes to Kilmainham&#x0026; The lord mayor of Dublin has no information, and goes to his villa&#x0026; The superintending magistrate Alderman Alexander, tells his constables to be in readiness, and goes out of town to his villa&#x0026; What is to be inferred from this, but that nobody believed that any riot or rebellion would take place? Is it possible that all these persons could have acted so had they been impressed with the belief that as serious rising was intended? Ministers have shewn that they will not be behind hand with their predecessors in taxing our pockets, but they wish to tax our faith beyond all example. I scarce ever come down to this House, but I am called upon to believe something which it is impossible for any man of common sense to credit; and now ministers come and tell us to believe what the m so superstitious Irish Roman Catholic bogtrotter could not digest. After786such a train of facts, how can any man affect to say, that the Irish govt. actually believed in the intelligence they had received?&#x2014;I come next to a very important point. It is confessed, that at the beginning of last year the Irish govt. were of opinion, that it womb proper to suspend the Habeas Corpus, and to establish Martial Law. Ministers here would not accede to that system, being desirous of representing Ireland as tranquil, as they had described the peace as profound. That the power asked for by the Irish govt. and refused, was so readily gin anted after the 23d, must have convinced that govt. of the best mode of obtaining it. It was then that the ostensible initiation of the necessity became apparent. And when we hear the noble lord qualifying and objecting to the principle, that prevention is always best, it might afford some suspicion that the insurrection of the 23d would not have been so very disagreeable, had it not been accompanied by the murder of Lord Kilwarden and Col. Brown.&#x2014;But although, in the eye of the law, one life is as good as another, it certainly is not so in the feelings of mankind; and, it is true, as the noble lord (Castlereagh) observed, that the murder of. Lord Kilwarden had given an additional interest to the melancholy affair of the 23d. But, since gentlemen argue so much of the good prolonged by the insurrection in disposing the intentions of the disaffected, in weakening their cause, and in establishing the glory of the loyal administration of Ireland, how many deaths d as this noble lord calculate as well compensated by to many advantages, and in what specific cases does he think that the principle of prevention is not the best? Such doctrines I must ever hold in the utmost horror. As was justly said the other night, on the subject of invasion, that every inch of Kent or Sussex is to be defended, so every man in Dublin, every house, every chamber, is to be saved front destruction if the system of prevention can be applied. Such conclusions would be a disgrace to the policy of the worst governments, would disgrace Machiavellians so much injured, if given as the result of the principles often so erroneously imputed to him. But I hope I mistook the scope of the noble lord's argument, though I am sure I do not mistake his words.&#x2014;The defenders of the Irish govt. cannot agree about the proper name of the transaction of the 23d. Sometimes it is a \"contemptible, riot,\" at others, a dangerous rebellion. It is said, there could be no danger, for there were 4C00 regular troops in Dublin. That force, I have no don but, would be able to suppress even a787formidable insurrection, but if an insignificant riot was expected cu the 23d, why was not the commander in chief directed to hold troops in readiness at the call of the civil magistrates? And why were not the magistrates in attendance to give their sanction to the operation of the troops if necessary? If it was a \"contemptible lint,\" why did ministers, upon such a ground, call for the suspension of the Habeas Corpus, and the introduction of Martial Law? If, on the other hand, it was, as Lord Redesdale says, not 8 persons of the ringleaders, nor 8O rebels in all, but that persons came from all parts of Ireland to cooperate in a plan long meditated; are not ministers culpable in being ignorant of that state of the country? With respect to Lord Redesdale's letters, it its been said, that next to the indiscretion of publishing then\", would be the indiscretion of discussing them. With all that genius which the Irish possess, (and I think they possess genius in a degree superior to other nations), with all this valour which they possess in an equal degree with the inhabitants of this country, with all the good qualities of every kind which belong to them, the people of Ireland have never been very famous for their discretion. It must no doubt, then, have been very gratifying to them, to find that a grave English chancellor sent over to then: had been guilty of an indiscretion, to which, indeed, nothing could be second: for it was of that sort that nothing simile et secunadum could exist. These letters are more than indiscreet. They must be infinitely mischievous if the author of them continues to fill his present station. It had been denied that Mr. Marsden had treated any one who came to give him information with want of attention; but I have heard, that in the case, of a Mr. Finlay, something of this kind was complained of. I do pot assert this to be the fast, but if an Inquiry is grated, I pledge myself to shew, that it is impossible any man of sense can be of opinion, that the lord haut of Ireland did believe that an insurrection, great or small would take place on the 23d of July, and that till within half an hour of the explosion, the Cory nagged chief had no intelligence with manner it was expected he should act it was sail by the noble lord very boldly, that the; was a complete far to justice in this affair bethought proper to qualify. This bar was the absence of Lord Hardwicke. Against such doctrinal I must beg leave wholly to prowls to Parliament doughty to exert its; control per the executive power, both in its near audits deist operations. If this were not to be the788case, what an argument against the union altogether&#x0026; For this Parliament is unfit to legislate for a country, the executive administration of which it cannot control. It has been said too, that the hon. hart who made the motion must know better what happens at Wolver Hampton than in Dublin. Against this sort of language I must also enter my solemn protest. Though, doubtless, more connected with his immediate constituents, and more devoted to their particular service, every member of Parliament is member for the whole empire, for Dublin as wed as for Herefordshire or Yorkshire. Such doctrine as we have heard to-night would not have been endured formerly, and if it is suffered to prevail, there must be an gently of even the pretence, of benefit which Ireland was to derive from a liberal, protecting, dispassionate legislature. I sin decidedly of opinion, that there is sufficient prima facie evidence of neglect in the Irish govt. to justify the inquiry; that the contradictors assertions of ministers respecting the state of Ireland, render our necessary; and, I hope, that the House, in such circumstances, notwithstanding their partiality to ministers, will face that the question involves the creak of the whole government.", "author_id": "/people/mr-charles-fox-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

But it was unbecoming the character of the House to institute an inquiry without a sufficient ground.

He could of forbear to express ills super at the time of bringing this motion before the House, If the arguments of the friends of use rejection are conclusive, how do they justify their neglect in delaying this great and necessary inquiry? The House, if those arguments be good, is more culpable than the government of Ireland. Of the hon. gent. opposite to him, (Mr. Fox), it may be, truly should, that no man has a more acute understanding. Yet he, with all the motives arising from his regard789for his near relation, with all his attachment to the privileges of the House, and his attention to his own duty, could not find, in all the time that has elapsed, matter, to charge the govt. of Ireland with criminal neglect; for, if he had, the hon. gent, would have been induced by those motives, to bring the question himself before the House. Having made thee preliminary observations, he should inquire whether there was any proof of criminal negligence in the govt. of Ireland on the 23d of July; and this eluded the consideration of tits kind of intelligence they had of the design of the rebels, and the question, whether, on such information as they h id, they made preparations adequate to the danger as that evidence presented it to them. It was material to the complete view of this matter, to consider what the character of the insurrection was. Gentlemen wend condemned for calling this a \"contemptible riot.\" What, he says, is that contemptible, whose object is to separate Ireland from England? No&#x0026; not as to its object; but contemptible it may be in its means; and such it appeared to be as far as Dublin was concerned. The difficulty of obtaining information that is sufficiently accurate, in so affair to which few were privy, and in which the zeal of the parties would enjoin secret, was not to be overlooked. With all this, what is the degree of information obtained? On the 23d the lord-lieut. and she commander in chief came to the Carrie between 3 and 4 o'clock, and the necessary orders were issued for the security of the city of Dublin. A military council was held at 0 o'clock, and the different posts very strengthened. Thus it appeared that; no negligence had taken place on the part of govt. The learned gent, here want through the history of the information received by the Irish govt., as it had been detailed by Mr. Yorke. He then said he would take Mr. Fox's acceptation of the word surprised, as applied to the government, viz. whatever they knew, duly were not prepared; and would examine the state of the preparations. After which, he went into the history of the preparations of the govt. as detailed by Mr. Yorke. He contended chiefly, from this, that the lord lieut. had done all his office required; and that the commander in chief ought to have put every thing under his command, in a proper train of preparation. He said, if surprise meant ignorance, not of the general designs and intentions of the rebels, but of the individual persons concerned, the particular plan, and the moment of the attempt, then he would acknowledge the charge. But these the govt. had not the790means of knowing. The hon. gent. (Mr. Fox) had argued against himself; for, if the lord lieut. did not credit the information he received, or thought it doubtful (which that gent, had contended), then his preparations were, indeed, great. For his part, he thought, the govt. in Ireland had gained all the intelligence their means afforded, and made every preparation necessary on that information. He could not, therefore, conscientiously agree to put them on their trial. It would be injustice to them; it would be contrary to the true object of the discretion placed in Parliament.

{"date": ["1804", "mar", "05"], "content": "said, the noble Earl had made a strange assertion, when he said, it would be as unjust to ask the Bank of Ireland to pay in cash, as to make the same demand of the private and country banks. His lordship did not seem to be aware, that the legislature had never interfered, and God forbid it ever should, to enable private banks to pay their own issues in a depreciated circulation. To the noble lord who opened the debate, the country was highly indebted for bringing forward the discussion. He agreed with the noble, lord, that much good had resulted from former discussions on this subject. The industry and talents employed by his lordship on this intricate question, had afforded much light to every impartial person, As to the702bill before the House, he had, on a former occasion, moved for certain papers, which, though not a positive rule to shew the proportion between paper and cash, would have given a result sufficiently accurate. The House had negatived that motion. Of that negative he would say nothing; he would only observe, that, since every door was to be shut, every information with-held, it, would be better for their lordships to pass every measure without discussion; and he must add, that that was the only instance he ever knew in that House of such papers being denied. He had reason to believe, if the papers had been produced, they would have shewn the proportion of paper over cash to be inconceivable. In one account which he had seen, of a receiver-general of the land tax, in 100l.he had received only 11 in cash. He believed this case not to be singular. And the excess of paper, as he had argued on a former occasion, he believed to be owing chiefly to the operation of the bank restriction act. Since 1797, when that act passed, the issues of the Bank of England had doubled, and those of the Bank of Ireland had grown to five times as much as they were at that period. It had been urged, that he was not consistent, in opposing this bill, since he was one of those with whom the measure originated. He owned the share he had in that. But he had contemplated it as a measure of necessity only, excused only by the peculiar circumstances which called for it. Because he had given it his approbation, first for a short period, then for the remainder of the last war, it did no; follow that he was bound to prolong it during the peace, and afterwards again to the conclusion of the present war. And is it to be argued, that because he had recommended a temporary measure from necessity, he was to support it ever after? He would submit to no such argument. And, if he had seen that this measure had produced great evil, and that the evil was increasing, he would say, that he was the mere bound to recommend the House now to recall it, for having been one to introduce it nor would he shrink from his duty, from the dread of being deemed inconsistent.&#x2014;The noble earl used but one argument for the bill, which was, since the Bank of England Restriction Bid is passed, you must also pass this&#x0026; He believed that was too true. But he would argue from that, the necessity of revising the whole measure, of reconsidering the whole system. The subject; could not be too often, too much dwelt upon by their lord-hips It might be said, that the English. Bank Restriction Bill cannot be703repealed this session; this was no reason for dismissing the policy of the bill without discussion. No ore, he believed, would wish to see the bill rashly or hastily repealed. It must be done deliberately and with preparation. But their lordships might weigh the subject now and hereafter, and be prepared to re-establish the Bank on its old foundation, without any violation of their lordships rales.&#x2014;The threat of ruin that menaced from the present situation of the country, as to its circulation, was great. The recurring to the old system was the only road of safely. The ablest writer on subjects of this nature, who had reduced the chaos of maxims to a philosophical order and luminous principles, Dr. A. Smith, had said, there were two sorts of paper, distinct in their character from each other; the former, by which the great dealers carried on their traffic; and the oilier, by which the consumer bought of the small, dealer. When the latter paper, he adds, comes to be prevalent, the ration is in great danger; and if, in such a case, it be invaded, it is impossible to contemplate the consequences without horror. The case put by this great man seemed to be nearly completing. In Ireland, the depreciation of the circulation is already very great; here there are symptoms of depreciation of the circulation. There is nothing to be seen between the consumer and dealer but paper. What Dr. Smith deprecated has arrived in part, and the rest is hastening on.&#x2014;Need he inform their lordships why the able writer spoke with such terror of an invasion, with such previous circumstances? it is because the only medium by which the great bulk of the nation, the labouring people, can procure bread, in such a case, is a paper circulation, which is annihilated instantaneously by an invasion. Suppose the enemy landed, and in possession of a town on the sea coast, which has a bank, the centre of a district; that is, whose notes are the only circulation for 20 or 30 miles round. The notes would (for the moment at least) be annihilated, and the entire labouring class would be reduced, not merely to beggary, but to want. The honor of such a scene is too great to be pictured. He would give their lordships an instance, which might shew what was to be expected in case of actual invasion. A report was spread in the town of Newcastle, that the enemy was landed. Instantly there was a run on all the hanks of that town. The proprietors were obliged to send messengers post to London, act for Hank of England notes, they would go no more than the country notes, but for gold. The shock was given all the way704from Newcastle to London, and produced the like effects. If such was the result of an alarm, what would an actual invasion do? Their lordships would easy conceive, by carrying their eyes forward to the rapid and destructive progress such things make.&#x2014;His lordship proceeded to point out the injurious effects which the restriction originally imposed on the Bank of England had produced in Ireland, by occasioning a similar restriction on the bank there. Not only had it operated to the disadvantage of merchants in their pecuniary transactions, but peculiarly grievous was it to the middling and lower orders of the community, by whom the depreciation of the paper currency, which was forced upon them by virtue of this new restriction, was felt as an actual diminution of their income, and the consequent enhancement of the price of the necessaries of life. He again deprecated the idea of the present being taken up as a party question, or connected with any set of politics. He viewed it in its consequences as materially involving the welfare of the bulk of the people in the United Kingdom of Ireland, upon whom the want of a sufficient quantity of the circulating medium of coin produced the most distressing consequences, and diffused a spirit of dissatisfaction, complaint, and penury, and which the proposed continuance of this restriction on the bank, his lordship considered, as ill-calculated to retrieve.&#x2014;After expatiating upon these topics considerably in detail, his lordship expressed his satisfaction at the appointment of an inquiry into the subject in Ireland, and his earnest wish was that an investigation should be set on foot on the part of both Houses, as the subject affected G. Britain as well as Ireland. It was by no means, as he had before observed, too late, and one great object for consideration, in endeavouring to remedy the evils of an excessive paper circulation, should be, a gradual taking off the restriction upon the bank: that corporation should be enabled, but gradually, to resume their cash payments: not, however, without due and full notice being given. The withdrawing of the small notes from circulation, would necessarily induce the introduction of cash to the like amount, to fill up the chasm; this, of course, should not be hastily done.&#x2014;Suppose, he observed, that within 3 months the one pound notes were to be called in, and, in another subsequent interval, the notes of two pound, the; most salutary effects would be produced in reference to what he had suggested. These were, however, only parts of the outline, which might be recommended to the attention of a general committee of inquiry, the705expediency of which, under the present circumstances of the country, the noble lord solemnly and impressively enforced.", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-grenville", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},

The noble lord had laid it down and asserted, that the conduct of the Irish I government on the 23d of July was better titan well&#x2014;whereas he (Lord De Blaquiere) thought that the government of Ireland on that day was worse, infinitely worse, than bad &#x0026;&#x2014;His noble friend and he, were, therefore, completely at issue upon the point, and t a war of assertion was to be continued as it had begun. But suffer me, said Lord De Blaquiere, to call the attention of the House793to a distinction which may not be altogether undeserving of notice. God forbid&#x0026; I should have the presumption to say, that any thing coming from my mouth deserved a bitter attention than that which any other man has offered, but when it shall be remembered that I desire to consign to a committee for the investigation of truth, every thing which I shall advance, and that those on the other: idea, who equally and boldly make their assertions, shrink from the investigation which I court, the House will, I am confident, make the distinction&#x2014;Upon the subject of the present discussion look, said his lordship, a little back and see if all these disasters have not arisen more from the mismanagement of government than from any other cause. View that fatal system of not alarming the people, that wretched admixture of fear and flight, whose operation upon the minds of men led to doing that which was worse than wrong; namely, to the doing of nothing at ail; a system which had brought this country to its ruin, if its feelings had not been roused by the persevering spirit and sense of the right hon. gent, opposite (Mr. Windham), who hid awakened the people to a sense of their danger, without; terrifying their minds or exciting their fears; and which had led to those exertions that have put the country into a situation, far beyond the apprehension of danger.&#x2014;In a hapless hour, however, the fatal, the favorite, but wretched system was like a pestilential disease wafted over to Ireland, and to this he did really believe was to be principally ascribed all the evils which have followed.&#x2014;The House would please to remember (they could not forget it), that some weeks previous to that fatal day, he had in that very place where he then stood, spoken his belief of the forthcoming mischief. He was treated with attention by the House, but his Majesty's ministers and their friends heard him with disdain.&#x2014;The country was then, as he feared many parts of it would be found now, in that state of silent, but perceptible stir, which has ever preceded every great explosion, and which has been the constant harbinger of deadly mischief.&#x2014;All is tranquillity, said the friends of the administration&#x2014;all is quiet, quiet, Mr. Speaker, said his lordship; so is gun-powder, if you will let it alone. In respect to the transaction to which the attention of the House had been called by the hon. baronet, he would be careful how he gave offence by his words, he would be afraid to call it a rebellion, and with shyness would glance even at794an insurrection&#x2014;most gentlemen admitted there had been a riot or a row, many more acknowledged there had been a disputes but, that there had been a difference of opinion every body admitted, upon the grounds of the impossibility of living under the austere control of the King upon the throne, and the tyrannical system of the English constitution, compared with the mild and benignant government of the Chief Consul of France.&#x2014;in this controversy, as is often the case, from words they came to blows, and he believed it was known, that in about a quarter of an hour some, live and twenty or thirty men were laid dead upon their backs. To the honour of government however, be it said, they had yet made no attempt to prove that any one of these gentlemen had made away with themselves. The hanging which succeeded carried off many more, not more, he begged to observe than the injured laws and justice of the country required; but the thing went on merrily every day whilst he was on the spot, and he heard it observed, comically enough to be sure (and in repealing which be hoped he should give offence to no gentleman in that House) \"that every man had been hanged, except those who deserved it.&#x2014;It was too late in the night to enter minutely into the several items of the transaction. Enough had already been said. On the 16th of July, the rebel magazine in Patrick Street blew up; and it appeared by the evidence of Flemming on Emmett's trial, that all the remaining ammunition, ball cartridges to the amount of 30,000, arms, &c.; were removed in the middle of the duly of the 17th from this rebel magazine to the rebel depot in Marshall Lane.&#x2014;That at this depot in Marshall Lane, it appears on the trials, that from 10 to 30 persons were constantly employed, not in the manufacturing of manikin pins or pocket pistols, but in the construction of some of the most formidable and cumbersome implements of war.&#x2014;Beams from 12 to 20 feet in length, ingeniously contrived, and holding from 20 to 25 pikes each other blocks of timber of the same bulk loaded with combustibles, I so massive and unwieldy, that less than 10 men could not easily move them.&#x2014;Then I how could the House credit, as it had been asserted., that 8 men only were employed in the work. Ail this had been quietly going on for some weeks previous to the rebellion and within a few hundred yards of the Castle gate, and this being admitted, (for it cannot be denied),bowis it we are called upon unblushingly to extol the vigilance and exertions of the government of Ireland? if795the Lord Lieutenant had the power sufficient to crush this insurrection in the bud, which he (Lord De Blaquiere) always shrewdly suspected he had not, why was it not exerted? If the Lord Lieutenant had those powers and did not exert them, he was Criminally to biome; but if, instead of being armed with those powers (so indispensible for the executive government in a disturbed country) it should appear, and he thought he had picked no as much in he course of the debate, that Lord Hardwick was not only unarmed with those power but that he had actually applied for them to his Majesty's ministers in England, and had been refused; sure, said lie, my Lord Hardwick can be no longer to blame: the blame, the neglect, the responsibility, no louder attaches upon him, it reverts with accumulated weight up n the shoulders o the right hon. rent, who sits in the next bench&#x2014;upon him and those with whom he has advised.&#x2014;The noble lord who said that 3,000 pikes only were taken, had been misinformed, for there noble lord, he knew, was utterly incapable of giving the fiat of his word to at thing which he did not believe to be true; therefore was that 13,000 pikes we taken on the 23d of July, and the succeeding day. Ins authority was from one of the persons persons appointed by government to collect them.&#x2014;To go into the military disquisition of the business, was at that hour too late: and, moreover, had been sufficiently explained by hon. gent, who had gone before him; but, that some thousand strangers had come into the town in the night between the 22d and 23d of July, every body knew. The government bad express information of it, not from ordinary and ill paid spies, but from Some of the not it respectable gentry of the country; and, that their object was to cot the throat of every loyal man. These are facts, said his lordship, for the truth of which, I desire to be brought to the tribunal of truth, for enquiry; that is, the committee moved for by the hon. baronet. He wished for the sake of the country in which lie had so long lived, and for the honour of the government under which he had so long served, that he might be put in the wrong: but, he supplicated, he implored the House, to satisfy the people of that neglected country, and let them know, whether all the calamities they hid so recently endured, were brought upon them by the visitation of God for their sins; or, whether they owed these disasters to the misconduct of men who were no more than themselves?&#x2014;That an inquiry ought to be induced, if argument can prove any thing, bad already been proved.&#x2014;The hon. general796who had been alluded to, did not go to Ireland to make a character; and it was the bounden duty of the House, to see, that he did not loose a character without a cause. The friends of that gallant officer, he was sure would vote for the inquiry; the hon. member his kinsman, had signified his intention so to do; it was honourable for both. He trusted the friends of Lord Hardwick would do the same, and to push the climax one step further, be thought, the right hon. gem. he Chancellor of the English Exchequer ought to do so likewise; as he should not scruple to assert, that, in the vulgar consideration of this business, his name had been continually mentioned; the government of Ireland with its yes open, and on the spot, could not nave acted the part they did, but for the express controul of the English cabinet.&#x2014;Upon the score of Lord Hardwicke, he begged the House would indulge him with a word. He considered Lord Hardwicke as a high bred nobleman, of fine manners, and engaging address; that for probity and integrity, he had never been surpassed; and, that in his breast the God of nature had planted a heart as pure and immaculate, as ever reed in the bosom of man; but, this was not die subject then under consideration. He thanked the House for the condescending attention they had been pleased to shew him; he should of course vote for the committee.", "author_id": "/people/mr-john-blaquiere", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

There were some things so extravagant in their own nature, that nothing but ridicule could reach themSafe from the bar, the pulpit, and the throne,But touched and sham'd by ridicule alone.the person undertaking to describe them was forced to have recourse to ridicule, from utter despair of doing justice to them by any direct or grave statement. Of this sort were the greater part of the allegations used on the present occasion in defence of the Irish government.&#x2014;Before, however, he touched upon these, he must say a word upon the right of touching upon them, which seemed to be called in question, or, rather to be wholly set aside, by the doctrines of an hon. gent, who had spoke early. It had been said, that to make inquiry into797abuses in Ireland, and to employ the result of such inquiries as a means of attacking ministers, was to make a use of Ireland, which mast be considered as disrespectful to that country. But, if this was so, it must be equally disrespectful to England, to charge upon ministers any abuses which might be found in England; and thus the government must be completely protected against a charge for abuses committed anywhere, if Irene alone were to be included in (he rule, the effect must be to make Ireland a sort of repository and sanctuary for abuses, into which parliamentary control and inquiry \"runneth not,\"&#x2014;a privilege which he and not conceive would be very honourable to her, or such as the hon. gent. alluded to would wish to claim in her behalf. He was in another view concerned at those opinions, inasmuch as they tended to draw distinctions between the two countries, which the union must be considered as having done away. There could, in reality, be no more distinction between the two countries than between any two counties of. Britain. Whether any one had opposed; be union, as he believed was the case of the hon. gent., or whether they had supported is a is his ease, (though, possibly, it might not have because had before Been all that had happened, or, rather, all that had not happened but had been wished from that measure, and by which the objections to it, as well on the part of Ireland, a.; of England, might in his mind have been overcome): whatever previous? opinions and feelings might have been entertained by any one, ah persons must now agree in endeavouring form ender its effects as salutary and complete as possible.&#x2014;Assuming, then, what he concluded was not seriously denied, the right of the House to I examine the question before them, one of the facts that first presented itself was the length of time, that the hon. gentlemen op posited to had had required, before they could make up their minds, whether they chose to be negligent or ignorant; whether they would be bulls or bears in the transaction: where they wished to pass for person?, HJI'I had not foreseen the danger, or who had neglected to provide against it. They did nor seem perfectly to have made their election even to that moment. One of the difficulties of arguing the question against them and one of the means which they had at escape, was, that yon could never tell on what ground to take them. Surprise, indeed, they had at length disclaimed. But then, the evils that had happened, or were upon the point of happening,798the near seizure of the Castle, the murder of the Lord Chief Justice, the possible and not unlikely possession of the city for some time by the rebels, were said not to be the effect of negligence: no: it was a deep design, now first disclosed, but even now not distinctly asserted, to avoid the use of repellants, to let the disease get to a head, in order that they might make a mere effectual cure of it. He was ready to confess that is as the only intelligible solution of their conduct; though he might be allowed to call in question the truth of it, because in fact it had, as yet, only been thrown out, without any assertion being made that this case was positively so. He could not, however, allow that the justification was a very good one, though he admitted that it was the only one that could by any possibility tally with the assertions that the Irish government was not taken by surprise, and yet not toiletry of any negligence. The only possible third course, was, that, seeing the danger, they chose, as was now hinted, to let it come on, in order that they might defeat it in the end with more elect and advantage. The objection to this course, supposing the fact to be as stated, was, that it was more proper for the case of a foreign them, than for a domestic traction. In the case of a foreign enemy it might be indifferent how many were destroyed; or it might be desirable to destroy as many as possible; but the feeling could hardly \"be the save on the pan of a government with respect to a domestic faction, that to say, with respect to its own subjects. Prevention there seemed to be a duty more strongly called than punishment.&#x2014;The rebellion had been called a \"contemptible riot,\" and names of great reproach and contempt given to all concerned in it. But it must be recollected, that names of that description were equally applicable to those concerned in the rebellion of 1798, which yet was not a contemptible riot. He could not moreover but thins\", that those who described their antagonist in these terms did not very well consider how such reflections recoiled upon themselves. They should parody the celebrated answer given by the Duke of Marlborough to Marshal Tallard. If the rioters were contemptible, what were those who were near being beaten by them?&#x2014;That people flocked in upon the occasion from all the adjoining counties, and that the seeds of the insurrection were to be found distributed through three-fourths of the people of Ireland&#x2014;these latter facts they had upon the authority of the highest legal officer in Ireland, (Lord Redesdale) a testimony, that799in every view was a matter of no light consideration. He should not talk here of the imprudence of these letters, nor upon the endeavour of removing the blame from the writer to those who had been instrumental in He publication. The letters could not have been published, it they had never been written; and as to the right of publication, without discussing that question too cicely, or professing to have formed any decided opinion upon it, it did not immediately appear how a man was restrained on any principle of engagement or good faith in respect to a transaction, to which his consent had never been asked. It was by no act of a mail's own that he received a letter: their could be no engagement, therefore, entered into, that he should not communicate that letter. What security even had he, that the writer had not previously communicated the letter, or might not at any time do so to ethers? And, without professing to know the fact, he (Mr. Windham) should be glad to learn, whether those letters had not been seen by friends of the noble writers, perhaps, by Ibis Majesty's ministers, before the time, when copies had got abroad from the hands of Lord Fingall. But even if these letters to Lord Fingall were to be considered as private, or could be made so by the mere act of the writer, and that the person receiving them was in consequence debarred the privilege of showing them to those whom they immediately concerned, the same interpretation could not well be extended to those which passed with Dr. Coppinger, the nature of which, any more than the situation of the parties, did not seem to imply any thing particularly confidential. These latter, however, were perhaps the most objectionable of all. In the former there was only the infinite absurdity and indiscretion if a correspondence, which was to offend, and prove to be retells, whether they would or no, three fourths of the population of Ireland, and to exhibit a picture, not indeed so extravagant as that which one of our poets ascribed to certain passages in another,Where God the Father turns a school divine,but where as great an indecorum was found as human affair? could well admit; namely, where a chancellor appeared in that character, and for the purpose of present oppression and persecution, was raking up ail the exploded controversies of more than two centuries ago his was bad enough in theology and still worse in politics. The doctrines were as false ns the promulgation800of them was injudicious and dangerous. But in the oilier case, there were circumstances leading to more fatal impressions of the character of the person concerned, than those even which could be derived from the strange perversion and singular imprudence manifested in the former correspondence.; A man who could write and think of the case of father O'Neil as is done in the letters to Dr. Coppinger, must be considered as I having lost for the moment all legal ideas&#x0026; and feeling. What could be thought of a person in the situation of the noble ford, the? first law officer of the country, the great source of justice and equity, who instead of being shocked at the horrors of that case,&#x2014;Ithe illegality of it as well as the cruelty,&#x2014;could had nothing to excite his indignation in the first instance, but the audacity of the sufferer, who had dared to complain? Was he prepared to say, that the whole statement was false; that the whole narrative was fictitious; that there were no scourging, no transportation, no forged testimonies, no decisions of two successive governments, pronouncing; either the patty to be innocent, or the proceedings against him to have been illegal, or the educe insufficient? If be was not prepared to say this, if it was impossible that he should be so, if the nature of the transaction and I the means of information did not admit the I possibility of proof such as could counteract the presumption arising from the facts above stated, or iii the supposition, either of guilt or innocence, reconcile the proceedings to say idea of justice, how was it to be borne, I that a person standing in the situation of the noble lord, should have passed over all these enormities, and have discovered no ground of complaint, but against the person who had presumed to recite them?", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-windham-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

Some gentlemen might smile, but his conduct, he trusted, was, and ever had been such, as to meet and defy every inquiry. He proceeded to remark, that the gentlemen on the other side had shewn little decorum in their change of opinion, and was surprised that those who had formerly sanctioned a system of severity in Ireland, should now express so great anxiety for the people of that country. It had been admitted that no imputation was thrown on the hon. general alluded to, and there were certainly no circumstances in the conduct of the Irish govt. which could be supposed to render the motion necessary. There seemed to be no complaint against the Irish govt., but that they had succeeded in tracing out treason in all its ramifications, and the only objection he should have expected from the right hon. gent.

It was802like the contrivances sought by parents who had agreed on a match, how to bring the young people together. Some did it by a ball, some by a water party, and some by one way, and some by another; but all contrived to help forward a matter very distinct from the apparent and avowed object. The late insurrection had not that importance which gentlemen were inclined to attach to it. It was a petty tumult, which accident had made of grater consequence than it otherwise would probably have been. He justified the vigilance of the Irish govt., and again maintained his own consistency. He had formerly voted for the suspension of theHabeas Corpus Act, and therefore, was justified even on that ground in doing so now.

{"date": ["1804", "mar", "05"], "content": "observed, that the arguments produced by the noble lord did not, in his opinion, warrant the conclusion which was attempted to be drawn. An investigation into the affairs of the Bank of Ireland would, in the present circumstances of the country, produce an injurious rather than a beneficial effect. No case had been made out which was sufficient to justify such an interference. The inconveniencies which it would produce, and the alarm which it would excite throughout the country, would far more than counterbalance any supposed advantages which would attend it. The bill of restriction which it had been found necessary to continue for some years past, was, he was ready to confess, not a measure in itself desirable, but which was found necessary to prevent greater inconveniencies than if such a bill had not passed. The experience of a few years had pointed out the expediency of such a measure, nor did he apprehend it was politically safe and adviseable in the present state of warfare, and when the minds of many were alarmed with the threats of invasion, to revert to the old system of admitting payments in specie to be demanded of the bank. It was true, that a considerable increase in the quantity of notes had been issued by the Bank of Ireland since the measure of restricting the payment in specie, had been adopted. It was to be observed at the panic time, that this did not produce a proportionate decrease in the quantity of the current coin, and this his lordship thought could be clearly proved from an examination of various official documents, some of which lie held his hand, and from facts which had occurred in the history of coining in this country.&#x2014;In the year 1793, the number of provincial banks were at least 400, and within a given period after the restriction was laid on, they were number from o50 to 360. Me contended, that the paper circulation did not tend to drive the coin out of the country. A diminution of the cash in the country, to whatever degree it may occasionally take place, was atributable to very different causes: if may arise tiara the balance of trade and of payments, which, as they were in favour or against a country, tended either to extract cash or to cause an influx of it. The demands for coin at the Clint were, during his Majesty's reign, and more especially the latter part of it, incomparably greater than at any former periods: during the present reign, the coinages exceeded 64,600,000lin his last Majesty's706reign 11,000,000l.; in that of George I. 8,000,000l.of Queen Anne 2,000,000l.and in King William's reign 10,000,000l.;for the last twenty years 32,00O,00Ol.were coined. So much for the amount of specie coined and circulated within the country, at different periods. On this ground, therefore, no deficiency could have happened, as to the quantity of the current coin. The scarcity which had arisen must have operated from extraneous and temporary circumstances. Such were the two years of scarcity, during the years 1796 and 1797 in addition to which, large sums were sent nut of the country in the way of loans, or foreign subsidies, during the war in which this country was then engaged. But when bountiful seasons afterwards succeeded, and the continental war drew to n close, money never became more plentiful. This was particularly the ease during the latter part of 1797 and 1798; and that, too, at a period when the restriction from payment in specie was imposed upon the Bank of England. These considerations sufficiently proved that the stoppage of the bank was not the cause of the evil complained of, but that it was owing to the large remittances in cash which had been sent to foreign countries in purchase of com, and which amounted to several millions, and to the large subsidies and loans to foreign prince, as well as to the considerable sums Sent for the support of our armies in foreign parts. In 1709, another unfavourable season occurred, which produced effects still more injurious than the former, and this was again succeeded by a similar bad harvest in 1800. During these two years, no less a sum than between 20 and 30 millions had been paid to foreign countries for corn and other articles of provision, which produced, of course, a great effect in the balance of trade with other countries. Added to which, in 1799, the continental war was renewed, fresh treaties were entered into, and fresh loans and subsidies were sent to foreign powers, without also taking into the account the very considerable expense which was incurred, and the sums sent abroad en account of the Egyptian armament. All these causes had more or less their combined influence to produce that scarcity of cash which had been so much complained of throughout the country. In the present perplexed state of our trade with foreign parts, a temporary interruption had been occasioned with respect to those remittances which our merchants had reason to expect it came, however, within his own knowledge, that mere are, at this very moment, large sums of707bullion in store, in several towns on the Continent, and intended to be sent to this country as soon as circumstances would admit of a conveyance. His lordship observed, that at the commencement of the war in 1793, there was no considerable want of coin in this country; and even up to 1795 this inconvenience was not felt. He had already stated those causes which occasioned the inconveniency in the years 1795 and 1796, and some of the succeeding years. His lordship begged, however, to be understood, as not arguing in favour of a too extended paper circulation, for he was sensible that this might be pushed too far. But, even in this case, he was not aware how far an appropriate remedy could be adopted. He felt rather inclined to refer that remedy to the natural course of events, than to produce alterations in the political machine, which he was apprehensive would rather do mischief than produce a benefit. Speculators, indeed, might suffer; but he thought it was better to leave the evil to work its own cure, than to hold out encouragement to persons of this description.&#x2014;With respect to the supposeable event which the noble lord (Grenville) has alluded to of an invasion by the enemy, and coupling, as his lordship did, this circumstance with that of the paper circulation, he could only say, that he knew of no attempt to remedy such an evil but what might tend to produce a still greater one, and such he considered would be the impracticable attempt of forcing the country banks 10 combine together in support of each other. In this case, the effects would be most alarming and ruinous to those banks which might not meet with such support. Banks solvent today must, in such a case, become insolvent to-morrow. But as to the argument of the noble lord, derived from the supposition of invasion, it might be sufficient to observe, in the first place, that such an evil might never actually happen and.2dly, that a partial invasion could net be an evil so as to produce financial embarrassments, and pecuniary distress, to any great extent. Bur, even supposing an invading army were to obtain a temporary fooling in the country, he did not apprehend that even in that case it would produce that dreadful effect upon the credit of the country, and of individuals, which had been supposed. In support of this opinion, his lordship referred back 10 two periods in the history of this country, when, in addition to a foreign invasion, it had also to encounter internal enemies, and who had penetrated into the very heart of the country. He meant the years 1715 and 1745. Upon a retrospection708to the latter of these periods, he did not find the list of bankrupts to be greater that year than in the preceding or subsequent one. He acknowledged that the circumstances between those times and the present were not altogether similar; but, however, it was owing to the same public spirit which supported public credit then, which, he had no doubt, would shew itself now, if circumstances called for it, and would not fail to produce a similar effect.&#x2014;As to Ireland, that country stood upon a different footing from this in various respects; but in this there was an agreement, that so long as it was judged proper that the restriction from payment in specie should be imposed upon the Bank of England, it would be found necessary that the same should be continued on the Bank of Ireland.", "author_id": "/people/mr-robert-jenkinson", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},

When the restriction of the Bank of England was first laid on. the notes issued by it amounted to between 6 and 700,000, but now they amounted to more than 2 millions. The difficulty would be greater now to the Bank it the restriction were taken off; but whilst it was to be taken into consideration, on the one hand, the loss which the Bank of Ireland would sustain by resuming payment in specie (and in which case it ought to have the assistance of the710government), so, on the other hand, it ought to be seriously weighed, the enormous loss which is sustained by the whole of the people of Ireland, by the considerable depreciation of their paper money. It was impossible to calculate the vast extent of the mischief which was occasioned by this circumstance. The incomes of the people of Ireland were already lowered ten per cent, and this alone was a greater injury than any which the Bank of Ireland could sustain, by resuming its payments. Besides which, it ought to be considered, the corporation of the bank must feel an interest in what so nearly concerns the welfare of the whole people of Ireland. In Gt. Britain, although Parliament has restrained the issue-of coin from the bank, yet it has put no restraint on the medium of circulation between one part of the kingdom and another; but, for the people of Ireland, no common medium is provided, by which they can carry on their commerce with facility; this was felt by Ireland, as a great evil, and he thought it was incumbent upon Parliament to provide a remedy. A noble lord (Hawkesbury) had admitted the existence of the evil, but it was with concern he heard him speak so doubtfully as to the practicability of the remedy This did not sound like the language of an; able statesman and politician; for it was the duty of such to seek for, and to apply such remedy as the exigency of the case might require.&#x2014;The present bill, his lordship was convinced, would only prolong the cause and increase the effect. For the first time, it was continued during the war, and not made annual, as former bills. For these and other reasons, he was against its going into the committee. As to the noble secretary's assertion, that the number of banks were diminished, this was no proof that the quantity of paper was; indeed, from the instances of increase in the Bank of England and Bank of Ireland, it might more fairly be inferred the reverse.

In this purpose, and on this ground, I hope for the support and concurrence of the House; because I do not believe it, will be asserted by any man, that866it is very right to pass laws for the better government of a distant, dominion, and very wrong to inquire whether such laws are obeyed or not In my opinion it would be a wiser policy and a safer practice not to make any laws, than to suffer them to be slighted with impunity. Habits of disobedience are very catching; and they are the more dangerous in proportion to the distance of the offending parties, and to the facility which that distance gives them, to conceal or disguise their transactions. I state these principles generally, as a rational ground of parliamentary suspicion and inquiry, whenever the government of India appear to be engaged in measures which the law prohibits; and not at all meaning to affirm, that such measures, when they are thoroughly examined, may not admit of a sufficient justification. The business and duty of this day does not call upon me to accuse any man, or to affirm that anything deserving the censure of Parliament has been done. My object is to inquire, and then, according to the result of the inquiry, to desist or to proceed. All I contend for, in the first instance, is, that a British governor who commences a war in India, isprima faciedoing that which the law prohibits; that his own act of itself puts him on his defence; that he is bound to justify on the case; and that; until he has so justified his conduct, the presumptions are against him. All the authorities of this, country have muted with one voice to condemn arid forbid the carrying on war in India for any purpose but defence, or on any ground but necessity. I need not tell the House that the practice in India has been almost uniformly, or with very short exceptions, directly opposed to the prohibition. While the Directors of the India Company had any power, they certainly laid down very wise principles, and gave very proper orders on this subject. When their power over their own governors was found to be insufficient, the legislature interposed, but, as it appears by the facts, with no more success than the Directors. Since the prohibitory act passed in 1783, I appeal to the House whether we have heard of any thing from India but war and conquest; many victories, and great acquisitions, with only now and then a short interval of repose, to take breath and begin again. There is another ground of presumption against the necessity and justice of these wars, which seems to me as strong and conclusive, as any presumption can be before the contrary is proved; I mean, Sir, that almost all these wars are supposed to originate in acts of provocation and aggression committed by the weak867against the strong. The strength of any single Indian state at any time, and now I believe of all of them put together, is not to be compared to the military power and resources of the English. I do not say that these nations have no means of defence, or that the Mahrattas for example, can do us no mischief; but that, considering the great disparity of force, it requires very clear evidence to make it credible, that whereas the disposition of the British power in India, is always, if possible, to preserve the peace, and to be satisfied with what we possess, this excellent disposition is never suffered to prevail because the Indian Princes are so restless and unruly, that we cannot, in common justice to ourselves, retrain from invading them. The fable says, the fierce, rebellious lamb, would never suffer the mild, gentle, moderate wolf to be quiet: it it was not you it was your father. These propositions may be true., but they require some proof; and, when the proof is produced, I shall desire it always to be observed and remembered that the evidence, that comes before us, isex parte. We hear little or nothing of what the opposite, and possibly the injured party, have to say for themselves. Ever since I have known any thing of Indian affairs, I have found that the prevailing disease of our governments there has been a rage for making war. The strong though ineffectual remedies which have from time to time been applied to this disorder, are a sufficient proof of its existence. That individuals may find their account in the conduct of such wars, I do not mean to dispute. But I deny that they are or can be for the benefit of the India Company or the nation, particularly in the present circumstances of the Company's affairs. In these circumstances, and in actual possession of half the peninsula, you engage in a new war with the Mahrattas, the success of which can give you nothing but an addition of territory, which you cannot keep without an intolerable increase of your military establishments, and a perpetual drain of all your resources, of men as well as money, and which you ought not to keep if you could. Whether the Mahrattas have united in defence of their country, or to carry the war into the heart of our best provinces, as they have done in former times, or with what loss or expense our success against them may have been purchased, are questions on which we are utterly in the dark. By public report alone we are informed, that a war of great, extent at least, and liable to many important consequences, is now carrying on in India, and that no information of it has been communicated to868Parliament. Sir, I can safely assure this I House, that the Mahrattas, though not capable of meeting us in the field, or at all likely to encounter us in a pitched battle, are nevertheless very well able to do us a great deal of mischief. In the year 1778, the Presidency of Bombay received and gave their protection to a Mahratta fugitive called Ragoba, and muttered all the force they could collect lo escort him back to Poona and to make themselves masters of that place. If the expedition had succeeded, I do not doubt that the persons who were engaged in it, would have been very well paid for their trouble. The event was, that their army was surrounded, starved, and compelled to capitulate. At some earlier periods of the history of India, the Mahrattas have frequently crossed the rivers arid made rapid incursions into the upper provinces of Bengal and Bahar, carrying universal desolation with them wherever they went, ruining the country, and making it impossible to collect the revenues. I know no reason, why they may not make the same attempts again, and with the same success. With such bodies of horse as they can collect at a very short warning, from fifty to a hundred thousand in different quarters, they may pour into our provinces, over run and lay waste the country, and then make their retreat with the same rapidity, without its being possible for us either to meet or to overtake them. This is their mode of making war, and it has always succeeded with them They are the Tartars of India. In these circumstances, I ask, is it proper or not that Parliament should know, why this war was undertaken, for what purposes it has been pursued, and with what success it has been attended; and finally, has it the sanction and approbation of the Court of Directors, and of his Majesty's ministers? I cannot believe it possible.&#x2014;If it should be stated, as I have some reason to expect it may, that the papers to which these motions allude, have not in fact been received by the Court of Directors, that answer must silence me for the present, but I must say that, in another point of view, it will be very unsatisfactory. The orders given by lord Wellesley, in consequence of which the hostilities began on the Malabar coast, must have been dated some time in June or early in July last. I beg of the House to observe the dates: we are now in the middle of March; so that 8 months and a half must have elapsed since the orders were given, and no information received at home on that subject. This is a case which the act of Parliament has foreseen and provided for. The words of the law are, that869\"in all cases, where hostilities shall be commenced or treaty made, the governor general and council shall, by the most expeditious mean they can devise, communicate the same to the Court of Directors, together with a full state of the information and intelligence upon which they shall have commenced such hostilities or made such treaties, and their motives and reasons for the same at large.\" Until it shall appear in evidence that this delay of information directly from Lord Wellesley is no; owing to any neglect or omission on his part, I am bound to presume that there is a fault somewhere. Supposing the measures in question should appear, upon inquiry, to deserve censure, that cause, of censure will be greatly aggravated by the neglect of sending home; timely information on the whole subject.&#x2014;I am not able to foresee what sort of objection ran be stated to the motions for papers, I with which I mean to conclude. I rather hope for the acquiescence of the noble lord on the other side. At all events, I hope and expect, that persona character, or the persona confidence due to any man, will not be alleged in bar to this inquiry. At prefect there is no charge, and there ought to be no defence. If have laid sufficient ground for inquiry, we are bound of inquire of crimination should follow, it must be answered, not by character, but by proof, When an inquiry was moved for is this House, in the year 1791, into the causes of; the first war with Tippoo Sultaun, no man's reputation stood higher in the estimation of the public than that of Lord Cornwallis. But I do not remember that any opposition I to the inquiry was set up on the score of his personal character, though none was more generally respected. On the contrary, his Majesty's ministers met the inquiry fairly, and thought they could not defend his conduct better than by giving us all the information they possessed. I hope and I expect that the noble lord, now at the head of the Indian department, will follow that example. He professes to invite and encourage a free discussion of all Indian questions If not, and if the motion, with which I am now about to conclude, should be resisted, I think the House will be reduced to one of these two conclusions; either that there is something in the personal merits of Lord Wellesley, which entitles him to greater confidence than was thought due to Lord Cornwallis; or that there has been something in his conduct, to which no other defence can be applied but a favourable opinion of his character. I move you, Sir, \"That there be laid before this House copies870or extracts of all dispatches received from the governor general of Bengal, or from the presidencies of fort St. George and Bombay, as far as such dispatches relate to or account for hostilities, now or lately subsisting between the said governments and any of the Mahratta princes or states with the dates of the receipts of such dispatches.\"&#x2014;\"Copies or extracts of all the correspondence between the said governments and any of the Mahratta princes or states, relative to the said hostilities.\"&#x2014;\"Copies or extracts of all orders or instructions sent to India by the Court of Directors of the East India Company, on the same subject.\"&#x2014;On the question being put from the chair,", "author_id": "/people/sir-philip-francis", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

From the moment that orders had been given, to march the troops from the Mysore, the commencement of the war was certainly to be dated The very march of that army, he would insist, was against the acts and resolutions of the House as much as any event on the 6tb of August. The moment Lord Wellesley issued those orders to his army, he ought to have sent dispatches at the same time to this country, stating his reasons for such measures; But he was apprehensive there was too frequently a suppression of documents. All the proceedings of the government of India ought to appear on the records of the Company, and be regularly transmitted to this country.

If attended with success, our empire in India must be as large as the two peninsulas, and consequently ready to fall in pieces by its own weight But, should we be defeated in our attempts at aggrandizement, the most probable, consequence is, that we shall be turned out of India, and a period put at once to our empire Here the hon. gent, insisted on the power and influence of the Mahrattas: In our former wars in India, our resources had been derived from there-venues of Bengal, which always remained untouched: but here the case was extremely different.

I should not have presumed, Sir, to take upon myself the office of calling the attention of the House to this subject, had it not appeared to me of a very limited nature, and one lying within a very narrow compass, or had I perceived a disposition in any other gentleman to do the same thing. As the subject, however, now, Sir, has been some time before the public, as it appears to me to be one of the greatest importance, as no gentleman has appeared disposed to take it up, and as his Majesty's ministers have not thought fit to give this House any information respecting it, I have thought it any duty to introduce it to the consideration of Parliament. As the House and the Public are not in possession of any official account of the course or origin of this war, of many of the transactions which took place in the course of it, and of many of its effects and consequences, I will shortly state to the House such leading particulars as, from the information I am in possession of, I believe to be true. I am certain they are mostly true, and where I am incorrect the papers I shall move for will set me right,&#x2014;From the year 1795, when we first took the island of Ceylon from the Dutch, to the end of 1802, our government in Ceylon seems to have pursued its proper objects, to have confined itself to the possession of the coast and open countries of the island, to the introduction of wholesome laws and civilization amongst the natives who live under our government, and every thing, I believe, during the period I have mentioned bore the strongest and most flattering prospect of improvement. We had never apparently, during this period, entertained the dangerous policy of interfering with the unprofitable interior of Ceylon, the woods and mountains, and wild inhabitants of the King of Candy's dominions. Some time, however, in 1802, it seems some subjects of the British government had purchased, in Candia, a quantity of the Areka nut, and which, in its way to our settlements,856was seized by officers of the Candian government. I have heard that such contracts by Candian subjects are against the laws of that country; but, be that as it may, our government claimed the property, and it was agreed to be restored, or the value to be paid for it&#x2014;the value, I believe, was 300 certainly not more, and the first difference between the English and the Candian governments was. whether this sum of &#x00A3;300 should be paid instantly or at the expiration of a few months; the real cause, therefore, of the war which was about to take place, was the difference between the prompt and protracted payment of 300 it was in this transaction that our national honour was supposed to he involved, for this our government left its useful occupation, and put all the troops in Ceylon in motion to chastise the King of Candy, to invade his dominions, and seize his capital. It is, perhaps, necessary for me here to state, that the King of Candy's dominions are composed principally of woods and mountains, affording no possible object for any rational enterprise, situated in a climate the most fatal to Europeans, and that his capital is in the heart of his dominions. Some time in January, 1803, this war began, and in a very short time, and scarcely with the loss of ten men killed in battle, we penetrated as far as Candy, which we took, and found the King was fled; so far we were all successful, but then, Sir, came, what our government of Ceylon knew must come, that dreadful malady the jungle fever, that forever infests the interior of Ceylon, and forever destroys the inhabitants of Europe. This fever, Sir, upon this occasion, destroyed hundreds upon hundreds of our troops in Candia; of the 51st regiment alone above 300 perished, of the 19th regiment 170, besides the 200 of the same regiment who were afterwards murdered. One should have thought, Sir, as we had thus displayed our power by the seizure of the King of Candy's capital, and putting the King to flight, as we had paid so dearly for it in the death of our soldiers, and as the country presented no object worthy of our possession, that our government would have instantly withdrawn the surviving troops; but it seems, Sir, our governor was not determined to play a great part in the politics of the Candian government&#x2014;for this purpose he left a garrison in Candy to secure success to our intrigues, and from this most ridiculous and contemptible interference of ours in the affairs of Candy, come all the dreadful and disastrous consequences we since have heard of. We first dethroned the reigning monarch, and put upon his857throne a new king of oar own choice, a person so unskilfully selected for that purpose, so universally odious to the Candians, that we finally withdrew him, and he has since been murdered on account of our partiality to him and his own presumption. We then, Sir, resolved upon changing the Candian monarchy into an aristocracy, and we guaranteed a form of government of this species, and put the first adigar, or first minister at the head of it. During all this time, Sir, the garrison of Candy were daily diminished and enfeebled by death and sickness; there were only left of British troops, the 19th regiment reduced to 200 men, and a Malay regiment; the House will know how to appreciate the climate of Candy when I state to them, that of the 200 of the 10th regiment, 100 were sick in their cots and perfectly disabled. At this period, Sir, the town of Candy was surrounded, I have heard, by 20,000 Candians&#x2014;certainly, I believe, by not less than 10,000. Our troops cut off from all provisions, reduced by death and sickness as I have mentioned, and the Malay regiment beginning to desert, surrendered, and laid down their arms. The termination of this dreadful tragedy we all know; upwards of twenty British officers, with the 200 unfortunate troops of the 19th regiment were led out two by two in the streets of Candy, and there, by the orders of the very adigar we had guaranteed in his government, they were knocked on the head, and had their throats cut, and this not even with the exception of the 100 sick men of the 19th, who were dragged from their cots and murdered. About the same period all our fortresses in Candia were attacked, all the garrisons compelled, to evacuate them, and all the sick in those fortresses were left and murdered. Thus ended, Sir, our invasion of Candia; it begun in January, and before the end of June our invading army Was all either expelled, had died, or were murdered. From the date of the event I have last alluded to, the destruction of our garrison in Candia, to the latest accounts I have seen, which are dated in September last, the situation of the island became every day more alarming; the Candians elated with the expulsion and destruction of the British had, in immense numbers, invaded our settlements from one end of the island to the other, and, according to the latest accounts, had left us nothing but our forts. The natives or coolies who live under our dominion, men of the most ferocious natures, encouraged by the example and successes of the Candians, were beginning to display the most alarming spirit of disaffec-858tion to us; such of the King's troops as remained alive were still under the influence of the diseases they had contracted in the Candian expedition; and, in short, such was supposed to be the danger of the colony on the continent of India as well as at Ceylon, that in the beginning of September, an expedition was fitting out at Calcutta for its immediate assistance. The latest letter that I have seen on this subject is of the 15th of September, and is from Madras; the writer of it states, as a most extraordinary circumstance, that no tidings from Columbo have been received since the 4th, and from this and from other circumstances I have stated, expresses the roost serious apprehensions for the safely of the island. Now, Sir, if this statement be correct, (and I am sure in most parts that it is so) it is, I think, a little extraordinary, that his Majesty's ministers should never have communicated a single syllable of information to Parliament upon a subject of so much importance; I apprehend the facts I have stated are perfectly sufficient to induce Parliament to call upon ministers for the most full and minute particulars respecting a war apparently so rash and so impolitic, apparently so destitute of all advantage, and so evidently fatal and disastrous in its effects; it is the duty of Parliament at all times to examine into and ascertain the objects for which the brave defenders of our country are sacrificed, and it is more peculiarly the duty and the interest of Parliament to do so at this present time. There are, Sir, likewise, circumstances connected with this war, and consequences arising out of it, that more imperiously call upon us to inquire into the conduct of the governor, and which I will briefly state to the House. When we first took possession of Ceylon it was not the least of our advantages, that we took with it all the experience of the preceding settlers, the Dutch. The Dutch had made this particular experiment of subduing the Candians over and over again, they had twice, with as little loss as ourselves, seized the capital and expelled the King, but on every occasion their army was finally destroyed by the same causes which have destroyed ours. It is singular, Sir, that on one occasion the precise calamity which has lately befallen our garrison at Candia befell the Dutch. The Dutch garrison at Candia were compelled to capitulate, and, on their march, and within two days journey of Columbo were, to The amount of 400 men, all murdered. The effect of these experiments upon the Dutch was to convince them, that all attempts upon the interior of Candia were not only859fruitless, but fatal to themselves; and, accordingly, for the last twenty years of their settlement in that island, such projects were never again repeated. The present governor of Ceylon was in possession of these facts, and of this experience, before he doomed our soldiers to such inevitable destruction; they are recorded in a very valuable and interesting account of Ceylon, written by an officer of the army we first sent there, and the materials for which history were collected under the immediate eye of the governor. I wish, Sir, the writer of that history had been more correctly prophetic, when he says, \"our government will, doubtless, avoid the errors of former European masters of Ceylon, who wasted, unprofitably, in vain 44 attempts to subdue the natives, that time and those resources which might have rendered this island one of the most valuable colonies in the world.\"&#x2014;With respect to the consequences of this war (independent of the unprofitable termination of it, and the mortification we must feel at having our brave troops apparently so idly sacrificed) they are really, Sir, of the most alarming nature. I need scarcely remind the House of the contiguity of Ceylon to the continent of India. India is allowed to be the great object of French ambition; we act upon this supposition in all our political calculations; it is with reference to this that Ceylon derives its greatest importance as a conquest; it is with reference to India that the harbour of Trincomale is beyond all value; and yet, Sir, with a war carrying on in India on an enormous scale, with a French squadron in the Indian seas full of troops, so often said to be captured, but still unaccounted for, with the French ports full of vessels and troops ready for expeditions, with a necessity at home for our regular army, move urgent than was ever known, and with that regular army more than ever neglected, we are placed in the distressing dilemma, that we must either, by with-holding assistance from the government of Ceylon, endanger our possession of that most important colony, or we must, in this hour of need and necessity, deprive ourselves of a part of our most valuable and most rare species of defence. I am informed, Sir, that 1000 troops of the line are now embarking, or have embarked already, for Ceylon. I am sure such supply is necessary for the security of the colony; but I ask the House if they will permit the country to make so important a sacrifice without a full and most minute enquiry into what has caused the necessity for so unfortunate a measure. Sir, there is another most dreadful consequence860of this war; after the little discretion our government has hitherto shewn in going to war for apparently so trifling an object, I am afraid when the passions and resentment of our countrymen are roused by the recollection of what has lately passed at Candy, I am afraid that any prospect of peace with these Candians is very remote. I am afraid we are doomed to an internal war with this race of people, and that Ceylon, instead of being the valuable acquisition it is so naturally made for, will prove only to be the grave of our armies. I do hope, Sir, that ministers in their dispatches to the governor will not fail to remind and to press upon him the past experience of this island; I hope, Sir, they will remind him of that great lesson for all Europeans, the late fate of St. Domingo. As long, Sir, as the natives of Candia or St. Domingo shall possess the local advantages they now do; as long as the inhabitants of Europe shall be subject to the diseases they now are, I believe, Sir, that all our attempts to subdue the natives of these countries must prove not only fruitless bat fatal to ourselves. I think, Sir, if this war shall appear to have been as rank and impolitic in its origin and commencement, and as calamitous in its consequences as I have stated it to be, I think the opinion of this House will be, that there is abundant matter for enquiry into this subject. There are too, Sir, transactions of this war that I have touched upon before, which I apprehend the House must likewise think call for particular enquiry: I allude to our interference in the politics of Candy; of our dethroning and making of princes and new forms of government in that country. If, Sir, we are really in earnest when we profess our respect for established governments, and our abhorrence of all usurpations; if we really wish for any character of consistency in the eyes of Europe, upon this important subject, it is high time that we bestow some criticism upon the very singular transactions of our colonial governors. I am not aware, Sir, of any other reasons I can adduce in support of the enquiry I wish to be instituted; but before I conclude, Sir, I beg to advert to a very cruel and unfeeling account that has lately been published by his Majesty's ministers, purporting to be a dispatch from the government of Ceylon, and giving an account of the murder of our garrison at Candy. This letter, Sir, is an attempt to account for the final disasters of this war, and which rest entirely with the governor by insinuations the most fatal to the honour and character of a British officer who has fought and who has perished in the service of his country and861this, Sir, in the absence of any species of testimony on which such insinuation could be founded I do entreat this House, on behalf of the character of this most unfortunate officer, to recollect Low he was situated:&#x2014;there were only 200 British troops, 100 of those were sick in their beds; the remaining 40, I presume, were not very healthy, they were surrounded by at least 10,000 Candians, they were cut off from provisions, and they were 60 miles from our nearest settlement: in this situation they were ordered by our new ally, the First Adigar, to lay-down their arms, and they were deserted by the Malays in our service. Does any man believe it to be physically possible that these 40 men, so unhappily circumstanced, could have cut their way through all these difficulties? Of this, at least, we may be certain, that had they attempted so to do, the 160 who were sick would have been murdered. I contend, then, that if in the absence of all testimony respecting the conduct of this unfortunate officer, we allow ourselves to speculate upon his motives, we are bound in fairness to believe, that he W3s influenced by a very natural and generous sympathy for this great majority of his sick and helpless fellow-soldiers, and that in acting as he did, he consulted what he conceived to be the best, not only for himself alone, but for the whole garrison of Candy.&#x2014;Mr. Creevey concluded by moving for \"Copies of all papers, letters, and dispatches, from his Majesty's governor of Ceylon to the government of Candia in that island, and from the Candian government to his Majesty's governor respecting the cause or origin of the war in Ceylon: 2. Copies of all correspondence between his Majesty's governor of Ceylon and officers commanding his Majesty's troops in that island during the war in Ceylon: 3. copies of all treaties entered into between his Majesty's governor of Ceylon and the Candian government: 4.

{"date": ["1804", "mar", "15"], "content": "&#x2014;Sir; the House will, I hope, indulge me with some small portion of their attention, more particularly fried the speech which the right hon. gent, has delivered, in whatever light I consider the present motions, the more I am inclined to think the conduct of the right hon. gent, as one of the most extraordinary proceedings I ever witnessed. I agree with the right hon. gent, that government did think the country plated in a most alarming crisis, and I was, therefore, led to hope that those who were of that opinion would abstain from questions more calculated to engender dis-882content, to create fears, and to diffuse dissatisfaction, than likely to be of the slightest advantage to the public.&#x2014;What I have most particularly to complain of is, that the right hon. gent brings forward his motions without any grounds whatever. He merely sets up his own opinion against that of the Admiralty; and, if this criterion is to be admitted, I can be under no apprehension with respect to the event of his inquiries, since the conduct of the Admiralty is sanctioned by the general approbation of the country. I feel, Sir, that clamour is no proof of the contrary of what I have stated, and that I speak from what I know, not, like some gentleman, from what is supposed to be known. I merely speak from the knowledge which has reached me personally, and I cannot help expressing some surprize at finding myself in so noisy a place, in so quiet a country. I trust I cannot be accused of inconsistency in calling this a very extraordinary proceeding, since, while an inquiry is proposed to be instituted, which has for its object the censure of the Admiralty, we find all the enemy's ports sealed up, our commerce protected in every direction, and our trade prosperous In an unexampled degree. If I recollect right, there was a time when the right hon. gent, was unbounded in his expressions of esteem for the capacity and talents of the First Lord of the Admiralty, and I should wish to know-how long it is since he has changed his mind respecting that noble lord. It cannot be out of the recollection of the House, that the right hon. gent, spoke in terms of the highest panegyric of Lord St. Vincent, and that when he recommended others to fill situations under government, as likely to execute the duties of their office with credit, he mentioned the noble earl as one so admirably qualified to preside over the naval department, that the whole country looked un to him as the only person fitted for the First Lord of the Admiralty. The only difference then, between me and the right hon. gent, is, that he has changed an opinion, which he solemnly delivered in this House, and that I have adhered to the sentiments which he stated, strictly coinciding as they did with my own feelings. \"With respect to the great talents of Earl St. Vincent, let me say, although they can derive no support from my feeble praise, that I believe no roan is superior to him as an admiral; and I am confident that I shall be borne out by the unanimous voice of the public, when I state that his services have been no less splendid, than productive of the most solid and permanent advantages. I also know,883that such is his patriotism and his sense of honour, that the noble lord would rather suffer every thing, than lose what he values beyond all other considerations, the confidence of his countrymen. The right hon. gent., altogether unmindful of the compliments which he before passed on Lord St. Vincent, now brings forward a charge of incapacity against him; for, by all his motions, nothing less is meant; and we are called upon to decide, that there is a glaring want of skill in the First Lord of the Admiralty, for which the right hon. gent. is to find an adequate remedy. We all know the pre-eminent merits of the right hon. gent, as a volunteer; we know how very much the country is indebted to him for his exertions in that line; but still, I trust, lie will excuse me, when I assure him that, I think the land service quite enough for him, without taking any part in the sea-service. But the right hon. gent, says, \"agree to my motions grant me the papers which I demand, and I shall undertake to prove all my assertions.\" I say, no; we must, in that case, necessarily have an inquiry; and upon what grounds am I to understand that an inquiry is admitted by the country to be proper at this moment? The details which must take place would be long and complicated, and they must go to criminate Lord St. Vincent, or give to the right hon. gent, a hold to move for more papers. I am at a loss to conceive how the measure can, for a single instant, be entertained by the Mouse, when no cause, no fact, is brought forward in support of it; when every possible energy pervades the whole 'branch of the public service over which the noble lord presides; when naval skill, vigilance and activity, are displayed in every quarter, and the best officers are employed in every direction, with the highest honour to themselves, and the greatest advantages to their country. But Lord St. Vincent, we are told, has prepared, or is preparing, only 23 gunboats, to oppose to the enemy's attempt at invasion. This accusation, which seems calculated to dispirit the country, comes, let me observe, rather oddly from the right hon. gent, who has called loudly for every confidence which could not be reposed in govt. and has deprecated, in the most earnest language, every appearance of party spirit. The fact, however, is, that there is a greater proportion of force, and of that peculiar kind of naval force adapted to meet the enemy's armament on the coast, to which the right hon. gent has alluded, than gentlemen expect. They will hear, not per-884haps without some surprise, yet I have no doubt with real satisfaction, that our naval strength is not only immense, but admirably composed for a great variety of service. The particulars of a short statement, which I have the honour to submit to the House, can be justified by the roost authentic documents, The ships of the line, frigates, sloops of war, bombs, and other vessels, amount to 511; block-ships supplied by the Trinity House are the lighters and small craft fitted in the King's yards, are, according to the last returns 373; the ships furnished by the East-India Company 19; and the flotilla completely equipped and ready for immediate service, amounts to 624. Making all together 1,536; and yet, Sir, this force of 1,536 vessels has been prepared and completed by this unworthy First Lord of the Admiralty I But, unfortunately for the safety of the country, the right hon. gent, has discovered, that only 23 gun-brigs have been contracted for. Will the House agree upon the bare assertion of the right hon. gent, that Lord St. Vincent is to blame, and requires a great deal of looking after; or rather will they not agree, that the opinion of the right hon. gent, has less weight with the country than that of Earl St. Vincent? \"With respect to building ships by contract, which the right hon. gent, so strenuously recommends, he says, it is nearly impossible to build vessels in the King's yards in time of war; but although this assertion may be admitted to a certain extent, it will not, I trust, be denied, that ships may be completed and repaired there. However we consider the question, it is evident, that we have no case made out by the right hon. gent, and that we require some proof besides his bare assertion&#x2014;I have also to observe, that the merchants' yards have been tried, and have been found not altogether so well suited to the building of ships as some persons seem to think. Are contractors so fully to be; relied on, that the right hon. gent, has had no cause to be dissatisfied with them, after an experience of seventeen years? Besides, Sir, Earl St. Vincent may be so very parsimonious of the public money as to be inimical to all idle expenditure. The speech of the right hon. gent, on this point appears to me to smell of a contract. I shall content myself with an instance of building in the merchants yard; The Ajax was built for 41,0001.and the bargain was thought a very-good one, yet in the course of three years, a further sum of 17,000l.was wanted to complete her for service.&#x2014;In short, Sir, we are called upon to decide, without proper885documents, that Lord St. Vincent is to blame, and that the naval law laid down by the right hon. shipwright behind me, is to be considered as undeniable. Are we then to pass an opinion, that the navy of England is hastening to its ruin, and this on the suggestions of one who calls for general exertion and cordial co-operation against the enemy; bat who now seems to be affected by a panic which he formerly treated which contempt? I wish then to ask the right hon. gent., and I will put it to the House; whether he believes that the attack he has me this night on the Admiralty, is likely to do good either in this country or abroad?&#x2014;With respect to the number of seamen, I have no objection to agree lo the production of that account; but the right hon. gent, has not taken a fair comparative view of the number raised within the first year of the last war and the year 1803. At the former period, after a peace of 10 years, the navy derived a very considerable increase in men from the spirit, of enterprize, the prospect of prize money, and the great distress of the mercantile interest. There was also at that time no supplementary militia, no army of reserve, nor a variety of collateral circumstances which, in the actual conjuncture of affairs, prevent the supplies of men for the sea service. The success which has attended the levy of men in the present year is truly satisfactory, when we consider that the land service has required great efforts, and that the volunteer force alone amounts-to 450,000 men; and so far should we be from blaming Lord St. Vincent, that his conduct in this respect is entitled to the highest praise. It appears, that of the 100,000 men voted by Parliament, there are not quite as deficient; for by the returns made, there were in actual service, to the 31st of December, 76,000 men; according to the returns made to the Admiralty by the regulating captains, 6,441; and the marines amounted, on the 10th of March, to 15,673 men; giving a total of 98,174 seamen and marines. I will now, Sir, put it to the House, whether a more successful exertion could have been made in the teeth of the volunteers, of the army' of reserve, and of the supplementary militia, where only 1,700 men were wanting to complete the whole of the estimate? But, Sir, this is not all; we have also a force of 25,000 sea fencibles for Great-Britain, putting Ireland out of the question. In all these instances I may safely ask, whether the noble lord at the head of the Admiralty is a fit object for distrust and886suspicion? But I am entitled also to inquire where the right hon. gentleman has had his information? If he has obtained it from some great naval officer, it certainly may be worth attending to; but until I am satisfied of this, all I beg of the right hon. gent, is, not to attack, by a side wind, a character that deserves as much from the hands of the country as any man that ever lived in it; a character who has fought the battles of his country with as much bravery and as much gallantry as any hero of any country, ancient or modern and from his recent exertions, zeal, and activity, has shewn himself as well qualified to serve his country in the high station which he now so honourably fills, as any man can possibly be. I will ask the right hon. gent, if he does not think such proceedings as that of the motion he has this night brought forward, and his subsequent reasoning on it, must tend in a high degree to invigorate and inspirit the enemy, whilst it must cause despodency at home? I have never heard, from any quarter, a complaint of want of men or of ships, except in the insinuations of the right hon. gent. The noble earl at the head of the Admiralty has procured nearly the fall complement of seamen voted by Parliament in the shortest time, and Under the greatest and most pressing difficulties that any man in his situation ever had to contend with, and, therefore, unless I have better ret sons given than any that have been hitherto adduced, I must think myself justified in refusing papers, the production of which can have no other effect than that of further inquiry, which would not fail to convey a very strong insinuation and suspicion against the character of Earl St. Vincent, which stands most deservedly so high in the estimation of a vast majority of the country, that I believe it is the general opinion there never has been his equal. On these grounds I agree to the production of two of the papers, but not to the others, as they cannot be produced without bringing in question what I do not think it now right to answer&#x2014;why the merchants' yards are not applied to for building ships at the present period. I therefore move, by way of amendment, that the following words be added to the first motion, after the words gun-boats and gun-brigs, \"and all 01 her armed ships, vessels and boats, used in the public service.\"", "author_id": "/people/mr-george-tierney", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

He did not mean to trespass on the time of the House, but to endeavour to confine, or rather to direct their attention to the leading farts which had taken place relative to our naval defence since the commencement of the War. It must he thought, be perfectly in the recollection of the House, that in the space of 48 hours after it was known that, hostilities were actually to commence; Admiral Cornwallis sailed for Brest to blockade the enemas squadron in that port. Since that time, his force had been from time to time reinforced, and was now so strong and numerous as to carry tile fullest conviction to the breasts of the whole world, that there never had been a period in our history in which the exertions of the Admiralty had been so great as at the present moment. When the House looked backward to what has been done since the commencement of the was, the large fleets we had off Brest, Toulon, Ferrol, and considered the loyalty, zeal, and activity with which every admiral, and every officer in these several fleets were animated, and then, if the question were, whether the right hon. gent., or Earl St. Vincent were in the right, he believed the House would not be long in determining.&#x2014;With respect to the gun-boats, he conceived those we had now in our service were far more useful than the gun-brigs which had been used last war, and which he appealed to the testimony and opinion of the hon. admiral opposite to him (Berkeley) whether they were not mere jobs? Besides, it was not by gun-boats that gun-boats were to be resisted; it was by our frigates, sloops, and other ships of war of larger force, that any very considerable and material impression can be made on them.&#x2014;For his part, he thought the House should cautiously entertain a question of this nature, and should refuse inquiry which would create suspicion, and might be attended with very mischievous consequences to the naval service, and to the general interest and welfare of the country. The House would do well to recollect also, that we had only been fortunate enough to any a very tow months peace after ten wars of extremely laborious service; so that, when at the end of the war the men were discharged, there was scarcely one who would not rather have died than enter again, which had very greatly increased the difficulty of raising the number that had been voted by Parliament. The men had, however, been raised to nearly the full complement; but this had been done by means of uncommon and unceasing exertions,888which reflected the highest credit on the Admiralty. From the beginning of the war to the present moment, the fleets had been constantly and continually on the alert; and there never had been shewn so much gallant perseverance and excellent seamanship as in our Brest fleet having kept its station in spite of every obstacle during so many months. The fleet lying off Ferrol, Toulon, the Texel, Flushing, &c.; had all evinced the same persevering bravery, zeal, and watchfulness, and shewed, that if we were but unanimous amongst ourselves, we might bid defiance to all the power and menaces of an enemy that durst not venture out of any of his ports to face the squadrons, whether great or small, that were stationed to confine them therein.", "author_id": "/people/sir-charles-pole", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1804", "mar", "15"], "content": "would not have offered himself so soon to the Speaker's notice, had he not been called upon by his hon. and gallant friend (Admiral Pole), and by some evident mistatements which had been made by the right hon. gent. (Mr. Tierney), To the first he should reply, that he was not aware of the jobs which had been made of gun-boats last war, but certainly could say, that the gun-vessels, which his right hon. friend alluded to in his motion, were not of that description, but were of a class of which he should have occasion to mention hereafter. With respect to the triumphant sort of flourish which had been made use of by Mr. Tierney, who said, that no ground of complaint had been made out against the Admiralty, and that he expected to hear of country being cut off, and vessels taken, he should only state, that something of that sort might have been all edged with justice, which he should likewise allude to by and by; but when he heard him state that the care and providence of the Admiralty had been such as to raise the whole extent of the vote of seamen, except 1700, he must suppose that he was so newly come into office, and as yet felt himself so little at home in it, that he ' had neither examined the truth of his assertions, nor asked any professional person if it could possibly be the case. The fact was, that he had taken the whole of the returns of the Navy-office from the monthly books I of the ships, which amounted to 76,000 men, I in which the marines were included, and had added the 15,000 marines which were returned to the Admiralty from the headquarters. Did he mean to say, that there were 15,000 marines at this time who were not embarked? Because certainly the fact I was not so. There was hardly a marine at any of the head-quarters. They were all embarked on board of the fleet, and included, as well as the 6,000 impressed seamen, in889the returns at the Navy-Office, and consequently included in the 76,000 men.; which I brought the question, if it had any reference to the motion' before the House, to a state much nearer the truth, viz. that instead of the seamen being equal to the vote, which I was 100,000 men; instead of being only 17OO short of that vote, it would be found that there were nearly 8O,000 short of that number.&#x2014;With respect to the number of gun vessels which the right hon. gent, had chosen to state, and amongst which he classed the launches and cutters, which he chose to say were better than the gun brigs alluded to by his right hon. friend (Mr. Pitt), he must positively deny both the one and the other, the number and the quality. If he chose to call every cockleshell into which a gun was placed, a gun vessel, he certainly might make them out; but of those he had seen, some were unable to go out, even too Spithead, unless it was in a calm; and as for the comparison, it was too trifling and too ridiculous ever to enter into the head of a professional man; but as the right hon. gent, was not so, be perhaps might be excused for making it.&#x2014;He should now come to the motions made by his right hon. friend, which lie must not only think proper but necessary, as they would not only put all questions upon the conduct of the Admiralty at rest in future, but tend to shew if they had done every thing in their power, and whether they had made every preparation for the defence of the coast which they ought to have done. In his opinion they had not. It might perhaps be asked by some persons, where he had gained his experience in the service to form such an opinion? How proper, and how just, how wise, or how decent, such a question, coming from such a quarter, might be, he certainly should not think of saying, but should leave to the judgment of the House. It was to the experience of much older and more experienced officers than himself he would appeal; and if all officers of high rank and knowledge in the navy were called to the bar of that House, they would corroborate what he should advance. He averred this. He averred, that if a sufficient number of gun-vessels, of a proper construction, had been built and maimed, which they could have been by this time, to have assisted the frigates and ships which the Admiralty say they have in the Channel, the junction of the enemy's flotilla at Boulogne would have been prevented; and this he would prove, not by his experience, but by facts and documents, furnished to the public by the Admiralty themselves. Look Et the Gazettes, in which the890gallant young officers who commanded the frigates, have told you, \"we have taken I, 2, or 3, gun-boats; we could have taken more, but they escaped into shallow water, where it was impossible to follow them.\" He asked, would this have happened if they had been provided with gun-vessels to assist them? Certainly not. But even of those frigates and sloops upon which such dependence is placed, he averred the Admiralty had not provided a sufficient number. No; not even for common duties of the Channel; and this he would likewise prove, by official docu-roents&#x2014;(Here he read advertisements for contracting for fourteen armed ships for convoys)&#x2014;what did this prove? Why, that the Admiralty were driven (for the date of this proposal is subsequent to the right hon. gent. notice), to hire the worst arid most expensive sort of vessels; vessels which, until this time, were never resorted to, except at the outset of a war, while the frigates, &c.; were getting ready. But what does this prove?. Why that the fact is, we have not a frigate; or sloop left or built, to fit out, for the necessary defence and protection of the Channel. Might they not have them? Certainly they might; and he was happy to find that he was not the only officer who had offered; plans for this purpose to the Admiralty; he would read a part of one of these plans, by which it would be seen, that a force might, and still may be, created, which would effectually secure our coasts, annoy the enemy, and by not interfering with the usual naval exertions, might be instantly manned, and by these means leave the frigates to those duties for which they are so expressly calculated (hear he read a part). If this plan had been adopted, these shameful contracts for armed I ships would have been unnecessary, and our convoys would have been protected. As it was, 19 of one convoy were taken, and carried into Spanish and French ports; and even between Spit head and the Downs, a very rich West Indiaman had been taken by the enemy's privateers. The system of gun-boats was much derided, and we were told they were of no use whatever. Another official document, however, would shew, that such was not exactly the opinion of the Admiralty, for they had actually contracted for 20 gun-brigs; but to make even this paltry number as ridiculous as they wished us to believe them, the time limited for their completion is, half in three months, and the remainder in six. Good God if they were of no use, why build them at all? but if they were of use, why not build more, and in the shortest time possible? As it is, in 6 months the project of Buonapart&#x00E9; must have either891succeeded or have completely failed. They talk of the nature of these vessels, and of their force. He did understand that one of the most scientific officers in the service, had not only laid his own ideas, but the plans of his father, who certainly was, without exception, not only as good an officer, but as accomplished a mechanic and ship builder, as ever was known; and when he mentioned the name of the late Sir Charles Knowles, no person would deny it. This great officer's plans were shewn to the Admiralty. What was the answer? Not very gracious, perhaps, but very true. One lord said he was not competent to judge; the other said he knew nothing of shipbuilding: this might be so, and it was not actually necessary, that either, a lord of the. Admiralty or a captain should be ship-builders; but at least, it was a sort of cousin-german duty to their own, and they ought not to talk of want of experience, when they were so ignorant themselves.&#x2014;As to the motions made by his right hon. friend, (Mr. Pitt) he certainly should give them his support; but, if he had a fault to find with them, it was, that they did not extend far enough. He wished to see an inquiry into every part of the naval system, into the treatment of the officers and men, into the situation and state of the ships, into the state of the dock-yards, and into the want of stores and artificers; for of these last, he understood, there was a defalcation of 800 shipwrights less than the usual war establishments. This he wished to see made from no personal motives against the noble lord at the head of the Admiralty, on the contrary, he had before disclaimed such motives, and he believed he held the character of that noble lord in as high respect, and was better acquainted with it than those who pretended to be such warm partizans in his favour. This inquiry would either prove the negligence and incapacity of the Admiralty, or place their fame so high as not to be touched by the breath of slander. Upon these heads, however, he should not enlarge, as they were extraneous to the motion before the House&#x2014;not but lie held papers on this subject, which might make the House start. These contained subjects, which, even in that House, were too dreadful, and too delicate to state publicly. But this he did not hesitate to affirm; and he begged the House to remember, that he warned them of it; that if the present system was pursued, whoever might be at the Admiralty, if this system is not immediately changed, the most dreadful, the most fatal calamity that ever happened to this country might be expected.", "author_id": "/people/mr-george-berkeley", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1804", "mar", "15"], "content": "&#x2014;Sir; as I very sel-892dom trouble the House, I hope I may be permitted to make a few observations on a subject of which, from the professional experience I have had, I may be presumed to have some knowledge. From the debate of this night, there is one piece of information I have acquired, that the French have got upwards of a thousand vessels at Boulogne. I am glad to find they are shut up there; we have one advantage in it, we know where they are; I wish we had any means of knowing when they intended to come out. I know this much, however, that they cannot all get out in one day, or in one night either; and when they do come out, I trust that our cockle shells alone, as an hon. admiral has called a very manageable and very active part of our force, will be able to give a good account of them. Sir, I do not really see, in the arrangement of our naval defence, any thing to excite the. apprehensions of even the most timid among us; on the contrary, I see every thing thru may be expected from activity and perseverance, to inspire us with confidence. I see a triple naval bulwark, composed of one fleet acting on the enemy's coast, of another consisting of heavier ships stationed in the Downs, ready to act at a moment's notice, and a third close to the beach, capable of destroying any part of the enemy's flotilla that should escape the vigilance of the other two branches of our defence. I beg pardon for troubling the House, but accident brought me here, and I intend that my stay should be as short as possible.&#x2014;In respect to what has been said of building ships by contract, I must confess I do not much admire that mode of keeping up our navy. IF have seen some of them, (I particularly allude to the Ajax and Achilles) that I took for Frenchmen.&#x2014;As to these gun-boats which have been so strongly recommended, this mosquito fleet, they are the most contemptible force that can be employed; gun-brigs, indeed, are of some use, but between a gun-brig and a gun-boat there is almost as much difference as between a man of war and a frigate. I have lately seen half a dozen of them lying wrecked upon the rocks.&#x2014;As to the possibility of the enemy being able, in a narrow sea, to pass through our blockading and protecting squadrons, with all that secrecy and dexterity, and by those hidden means that some worthy people expect, I really, from any thing that I have seen in the course of my professional experience, am not much disposed to concur in it. I know, Sir, and can assert with confidence, that our navy was never better found, that it was never better supplied, and893that our men were never better fed or better clothed. Have we not all the enemy's ports blockaded, from Toulon to Flushing? Are we not able to cope, any where, with any force the enemy dares to send out against us? and do we not even out-number them at every one of those ports we have blockaded? It would smack a little of egotism, I fear, were I to speak of myself; but, as a person lately having the command of 6 ships, I hope I may be allowed to state to the House how have been supported in that command. Sir, during the time that I was stationed off Fervor, I had ships passing from the fleet to me every three weeks or a month, and so much was the French commander shut up in that port deceived by these appearances, that he was persuaded, and I believe is to this very hour, that I had 12 ships under my command, and that I had two squadrons to relieve each other, one of 6 inside, and another of 6 outside.\"", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-pellew", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

He could not possibly suppose that our naval force was inadequate to the task, of totally discomfiting the whole force of (he enemy, if they came fairly out to them: but he meant to say, that they never could possibly have collected in the force in which they now are, if we had had a sufficient number of gun-boats to run in shore, and attack them in shoal water, where they frequently escaped from our large vessels, on account of their drawing too much water to be able to pursue them in shore.", "author_id": "/people/mr-george-berkeley", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1804", "mar", "15"], "content": "said, that, undoubtedly, the question now before the House was extremely interesting to every member of that House, and to every individual in this country, and upon which he was anxious to say what he felt. He wished to enter upon this question as a representative of the people of England should, and as the people of England, or he mistook them, expected their representatives to do; and in beginning, he would say, that in his opinion, there would bean end to the security of this country, if subjects like the present were not treated with a becoming gravity in that House: this was what the people of England had a right to expect from that House, and did expect from that House. He did not think that the right hon. gent. (Mr. Tierney), who followed his right hon. friend (Mr. Pitt), had been happy in 'he choice of the manner in which he had treated this subject to night. He confessed, that the manner in which he took up the subject, the tone in which he spoke of it, the temper with, which he discussed it, the epithets he bestowed upon it, the character he gave to the motive with894which it was brought (forward, and what was more of importance than the character. of any man's motive?) the manner in which he passed over the important crisis in which this business was discussed, were all of them, in his judgment, injudiciously managed by the right hon. gent. We were in a state of difficulty and danger which required great fortitude and judgment, in which the members of that House should discuss important questions gravely and sedately. But what would the public think of them, what comments would they make upon the debates of that House, if they were to hear such topics as were brought forward by the right hon. gent. in answer to his right hon. friend? The right hon. gent, seemed to think that he had some ground of reflection upon his right, hon. friend, by saying he ought to be content with being a leader in the volunteer system of our defence by land, and that he should not intermeddle with our naval defence; what was this but admitting, although the right hon. gent, did not intend it, that his right hon. friend's mind, which could not be confined to one species of defence for his country, or with one sort of force or means for its security, but that he was capable of assisting his country by his wisdom in council, his energy of thought, and his activity in execution; first to raise and qualify the mighty mass of volunteers for the essential protection of their country in the hour of peril, should that event arise; but after accomplishing a system for that purpose, then to endeavour to render the exertions of such a force unnecessary, by maturing the still more immediate and most natural system of defence of this country, and which went still more with the hearts of the people of it,&#x2014;its naval force.&#x2014;It did. therefore seem to him that the very statement of the motion of his right hon. friend was of itself a sufficient illustration of its importance and of its propriety. He should have wished, as he had hoped, it had been discussed nakedly, and simply, and plainly, and put to the good sense of the House, instead of being mixed with matter which appeared to him to be foreign to it. Fie did not distinctly understand the ground on which the right hon. gent, had put his opposition to this motion. He could have understood him if he had put it upon the absolute impropriety of asking any questions upon this subject at the present moment, of the. propriety of abstaining from all inquiry, and of confiding in the first lord of the Admiralty, whose merits, Mr. Wilberforce said, he was perfectly ready to acknowledge; yet he was of opinion, that the services of that distinguished person, however great, were not to be urged as rea895sons against entering upon the inquiry to which these motions led. However, the right hon. gent., besides stating as an objection that which was no objection at ail, had also stated something that had the appearance of objection, by saving there was an imprudence in these motions, because disadvantages would arise from the inquiry to which they led. Now, if that right hon. gent, could prove that sufficient exertions had been made, no inquiry would be necessary, and the right hon. gent, himself had admitted, that if the motion was granted, there would then be strong reason for going into an inquiry. Now, there were two things to be considered upon the present occasion: first, as to the danger of inquiry which the right hon. gent, had hinted at, by which he presumed was meant, the danger of publicity in such a case as this. To this he asked, in his turn, whether the House had not means of avoiding that publicity which was supposed to be so dangerous? Could not the House appoint a committee of secrecy? Was the House so intirely destitute of means of making inquiry that they must let matters go on as they may, though they thought them injurious to the country, for fear of giving information to the enemy? He thought that we were in no such dilemma, he thought that means might be found, if necessary, of making this inquiry, without any of that publicity which appeared, to the right hon. gent, so dangerous. But what was the alternative? If there had not been a sufficient degree of exertion used in bringing forward the best mode of naval defence for this country, what was to be done?&#x2014;must we continue to go on in a defective mode of defence, rather than risk the danger of publicity in adopting a better? He owned, that between the two, he found no difficulty in taking his choice, and he must say, that a prima facie case had been made for the inquiry, nor had he heard any solid reason given, or even a prima facie case made out against such an inquiry.&#x2014;Another argument used by the right hon. gent, was, that perfect content reigned throughout the whole country with regard to the merit of our naval service. He was aware that here he trod on delicate ground, and he would abstain from saying a word upon that subject, if he did not think he should betray the duty he owed to the people of this country, if he past it over. Every man must speak of discontent at the conduct of any department of government, as it might appear to prevail generally among those with whom he had an opportunity of conversing, and his opinion must be formed from what he896heard from such men, and from the opinion he might entertain of the means of information and judgment of such persons. The subject of content or discontent with the-conduct, of any department under govt, must be thus considered, and thus had he been endeavouring to consider this subject, and he must say to the House, that he had not found a single professional man in the navy, who had not professed himself privately and confidently to him in the highest degree dissatisfied with the conduct of the Admiralty. Every one with whom he conversed upon that subject, had expressed himself extremely dissatisfied with the general system of conduct pursued by the board of Admiralty in this war. He had asked professional men of different habits, of different classes of life, in the profession of the navy, of different attachment to parties, and of different connexions in life; some of them of the highest rank, gained, as he wished men might always, to a given extent, gain high stations, where there was no objection to them on the score of ability, by the influence of those with whom they had the good fortune to associate; he had conversed with another class of men who always were, and always would be respected by every body, those who had advanced to high stations purely by their own personal merit; from all of whom he had received one and the same general answer. He had made it his business to consult persons not only of the highest rank, lint also of as long experience, and as intimate acquaintance with naval subjects as, perhaps, any person in the service, and he must declare, that the terms he just now used, were milder than any he heard from these officers; the terms he used, were not only milder, but they were weak in comparison to those used by such officers to signify their discontent at the system adopted by the present board of Admiralty with reference to the naval service of this country. This he would declare most solemnly, if he were giving evidence upon the subject in a court of justice. This was justified by communications that were made to him from persons to whom general credit was due from all sides of that House.&#x2014;As to the argument that Parliament gave the noble lord at the head of the Admiralty no more than 100,000 seamen, there was nothing in it; for if Parliament gave the noble lord no more than 100,000 seamen, it was because he asked for no more: and here he could not help wishing that the gallant admiral on the other side of the House (Admiral Berkeley) might not be right, when he said that the 15,000 marines were included in the 76,000 seamen897mentioned by the right hon. gent.; but be that as it may, it was no defence to the Admiralty that 100,000 seamen was the whole number which Parliament granted, for had the Admiralty Board asked for any additional number, or even twice the number, Parliament would have granted them; but it had been a thousand times stated in that House, that the exact number of seamen voted was never to be considered as that exact definite number to be raised or to be employed, but that as many of (hem were to be employed as could be obtained, if wanted; and, therefore, although this same vote was only 100,000 seamen, yet if there had been raised and employed 130;000, 140,000, or 150,000, it wanted, there would have been no difficulty about having a vote for them; it was, therefore, no defence of the noble lord to say, that Parliament granted no more seamen than 100,000.&#x2014;His right hon. friend had also slated, that as to line of battle ships, the customary mode of having them built in merchants. yards had not been resorted to, and that in this change of system a considerable number of slips in the merchants yards on the river were entirely unoccupied. This objection of his right hon. friend to the conduct of the Admiralty, required a much better answer than it had received: it required an answer very different from that observation which was made upon it by the right hon. gent., who said, it smelt of a contract: his right hon. friend's mind and manner of life were such, as to render such an observation wholly inapplicable to him, for he had never been remarkable for any connexion of this sort: this was a sort of insinuation by which he believed the right hon. gent., upon reflection, would not abide.&#x2014;As to the idea that ships built by contract were ill built, he must observe, if they were so, it must be the fault of the Admiralty, for they could prevent any imposition of that sort upon the public by merely doing their duty, by taking care that these matters were duly inspected at fit seasons and occasions; and, therefore, when gentlemen said such ships were ill built, they only published the negligence of the Admiralty. But it must not be supposed that two ships of the line happening to be ill built, must be taken as proof that all ships built by contractors were bad; it must be recollected, that in the course of 7 years peace, not less than 20 ships of the line had been built in the merchants' yards before the late war, and now, when there was most occasion for promptness and expedition, the old system was departed from, and another adopted, by which898that expedition was lost. All those advantages were given up without any adequate exertions in the King's dock-yards; out what was still worse than all the rest was, that which was stated by the gallant Admiral on the other side of the House (Admiral Berkeley) which was, that the present number of artificers in the King's dock-yards was 800 short of its usual and necessary complement; for he understood the hon. admiral to have said, that the King's dock-yards were short I of their complement of shipwrights by 800; and this was the period, and these were the circumstances when the Board of Admiralty thought fit to abandon the system of building ships of war in the docks of the merchants He declared from the bottom of his heart, there was not a man existing for whom he felt more respect than he did for the noble lord at the head of the Admiralty. No man's services had been more signal, nor any whose talents appeared to him to be superior in his profession: but all this was no reason why the documents now moved for, should not be laid on the table of that House, and if it was seen that my Lord St. Vincent had conducted himself meritoriously in his present as in his former character, the House would take much pleasure in doing justice to his character; but he must protest against the doctrine laid down by the right hon. gent., that we were to wait until some disaster happened before we instituted any inquiry: we could not afford such a speculation; the business of that House was to prevent, not to wait for disaster, for if they waited for it, the loss might become irreparable; the only way he knew to prevent disaster, was to inquire into those circumstances which appeared likely to lead to it, in order to apply a remedy for the impending evil. The course recommended by the right hon. gent, was too full of hazard; the stake was too large to play a game so desperate. Upon the whole of this matter, he felt himself bound to declare, that he was fully convinced of the propriety of all the motions which had been stated by his right hon. friend.", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-wilberforce-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1804", "mar", "15"], "content": "&#x2014;It was my intention, Sir, to wait until I should hear the opinions of professional men on this subject; but the observations which have been made by the hon. member who has just sat down, urge me to obtrude myself to your notice thus prematurely, and contrary to my original intention. The hon. gent, has, in my mind, used observations the most unwarrantable on parliamentary grounds I have ever heard in. this House. He has stated, that he has never had conversation with any naval officer, whose899opinion has not been decidedly in contradiction to the system upon which the naval affairs of the country have been for some time back conducted; hat is to say, since the gallant admiral, who now presides at the head of the Admiralty Board, was appointed to that high station; and this information so obtained, he offers to the Mouse as a justification for the censure which the advocates for the motion before the House would attach to the character of the noble lord at the head of the Admiralty. The hon. gent, ventures to tell the House, that upon grounds such as these, there is a sufficient reason for the inquiry, and for granting the papers required; but from whom has the hon. gent. obtained the intelligence, and heard the sentiments to which he. thinks the House ought to attach so much, importance?&#x2014;from officers, no doubt, who are ashore and unemployed, from those who have not the best opportunity of judging, and whose judgment I for many reasons is not entitled to the first attention; bat not from such officers as those whom the House has heard this night, not from such as the gallant admiral who preceded the hon. gent to whom am now alluding, and who has attracted my notice by statements which t am inclined to think he has collected from persons such as I have described, from those whose accounts of the condition of the navy naturally receive a colouring from their own situation. Tints the hon. gent, would persuade us to found our verdict, on an occasion so important as that now before us, upon evidence drawn from such sources, upon second-hand assertions, in a word upon mere hearsay. The hon. gent, is no doubt a conscientious man, he certainly so considers and describes himself, and we cannot give him any credit at all if we do not believe him to be so, and I would appeal to his conscientiousness whether he does think that any court of justice, and this House is now called upon to act in that capacity, would pronounce sentence in any case upon evidence of the nature of that upon which he seems to rely? I say that there is no court that would attend to, much less believe such assertions. If the hon. gent, has any charge to urge against the noble lord against whom the motion before the House appears to be pointed, I say, let the evidence be brought forward; but don't let accusations be insinuated or sent abroad, unsupported by any witnesses whatever, unjustified by any fact, and excused only by a loose Statement, that such and such officers, whom no one ventures to name, are much in the habit of speaking ill of the conduct of the Admiralty, and of the character of its prin-900cipal director. The hon. gent., however, has told us, that he entertains a very sincere respect for this noble lord; and, really, here I must remark, that I never heard of any public character for whom men are more forward to profess respect, nor one that is so much respected, and yet so much aspersed. The grounds of the respect are, however, notorious, while those of the aspersion are not pretended to rest upon more than hearsay evidence, which is surely not sufficient to induce this House to acquiesce in a motion that has no other object in view, than to convey an imputation upon one. of the most gallant and meritorious characters this country has ever produced. For such a purpose I will never give my vote. I will not consent to the grant of a single slip of paper, however plausible the pretence for demanding it, that may lead to an inquiry for which there exists no necessity whatever; to enter into which would imply a suspicion for which there is not the shadow of excuse, and import an accusation for which there is not the slightest ground. I would ask the right hon. mover of this proposition, what are the reasons, for he certainly has not stated any, which have provoked him to alter his sentiments with respect to the noble lord who was the subject of such warm panegyric, upon the first accession of the present ministers to office; and who, I would be curious to know, does the right hon. gent, think more adequate to the high station he fills; whom would he recommend to succeed him? If the right hon. gent, did pronounce the splendid panegyric to which I have alluded upon this noble lord, upon light grounds, he was certainly very censurable, for he was, as it were, giving a false character, and that of a I great public servant; but it was well known that those grounds were not light, they rested upon the highest public services, and were supported by the warm and unanimous applauses of the country. Why then have the right hon. gent., or the hon. gent, who spoke last, changed their opinions? Why have they altered their sentiments of the noble lord? Has any thing occurred since to induce or justify the change? I challenge them to take the most minute retrospect of the conduct of that noble lord since his appointment to the presidency of the Admiralty. I call upon them to retrace all his steps, and to point put one reason why he has forfeited their confidence. I mean such a reason as this House would recognise as sufficient to justify the proposed inquiry. What facts have they in their power to produce? I am satisfied they have none, and therefore I will resist the proposition. 5 and this is the first instance901in which it has happened that I have felt it my duly to oppose a motion for inquiry. Indeed, on every such motion heretofore, that I recollect, particularly during the administration of the right hon. gent, by whom the present motion is submitted to the House, ample grounds were laid to demand inquiry; but in this instance I am of opinion that the demand is unsupported, not merely by common sense, but common decency. I do not intend to attribute improper motives to the right hon. mover; but I beg to ask him, what good can he accomplish by the production of papers respecting the state of our navy in a former war? What are his views? Does he mean to institute a comparison between Lord St. Vincent and Lord Spencer? To ascertain which of the two is better qualified to manage our naval concerns? I cannot see the purpose of such a contrast. It cannot tend to any good object. Indeed I am confident, that if a stranger were to observe the whole of this proceeding, he would not hesitate to pronounce that it could be only actuated by factious and party motives. This I am the more strongly inclined to believe from the statements of the gallant officer (Sir K. Pellew), which was quite a satisfactory reply to all the arguments that have been advanced this evening, and a full refutation of the calumnies that have been for some time back propagated relative to the condition of our navy. In that speech, which applied as forcibly to the heart as the understanding, the hon. baronet manifested not only that sincerity and frankness which is the general characteristic of that profession of which be forms so bright an ornament, and which never fails to interest any man capable of feeling, hut also a considerable share of acuteness and judgment; he made some very pertinent remarks upon the nature of those gun-boats which seem to be such favourites of the right hon. gent, who brought forward this motion, but of which the hon. bart. does not appear at all to approve; and, from my own observation, I certainly am disposed to agree with that hon. baronet, who is much more competent to I judge upon the subject than the right hen, gent, or any other statesman. I am not surprised that these gun-boats should be treated with so much contempt by naval men. I have happened to see something of them myself, by accident, in the course of the last war on the south coast, and they really appeared to me to be quite unfit to render any material service in the way of attack or defence; indeed some of them were incapable of firing a shot. It is known that out of the 120 gun-902boats which the right hon. gent, had in com mission at the close of the last war, there were scarcely any retained as at all useful, and that 62 of them) which were purchased from contractors, were much the worst. Enough has been said by the hon. bart. of the kind of vessels which contractors gene rally built; and, without referring to the ships of the line, of which the hon. bart. has taken notice, in proof of the badness of materials and the inferiority of their workmanship, I shall only remark on these gun-boats. I do not, indeed, like to dwell on the misconduct of inferior officers in any department, I do not wish to hear of such persons in this House; we should look al ways to the heads of those departments as the persons answerable to us. The navy board may be suspected of having played into the hands of the contractors during the last war; and to that, perhaps, was owing the great inferiority of the right hon. gent.'s gun-boats&#x2014;an inferiority which was certainly very glaring, for out of the 120, 87 were sold, after advertisement, for almost nothing; some which could not be disposed of were retained, and six were sent to Jersey, which were found so utterly useless, that Captain D'Auvergne knew not what to do with them. He, however, sent five of them home some time after, and was obliged to send some of his best cruisers to tow them safely, Yet this is the kind of force which the right hon. gent, would recommend in preference to any other to defend our coast!. It reminds me of an anecdote of the right hon. gent.'s administration, when 3 men of war were sent to this country from Portugal, which was our ally; those ships were found to be so incapable of giving us any assistance, but, on the contrary, were so little sea-worthy, that it was determined to send them home, and it became absolutely necessary to dispatch one of our frigates with them as a convoy. Such shipping would of course be rather an incumbrance to us; and the gun boats, to which the right hon. gent, is so partial, would, from all that I have heard abroad, which is corroborated by the hon. bart. this night, be rather injurious on the score of expense, and the number of men they would necessarily require, than likely to be serviceable.&#x2014;An hon. admiral on the lower bench (Admiral Berkeley) has, in the course of a very extraordinary speech, stated, that he had delivered in a plan to the Admiralty, which, if acted upon, must effectually secure our own coast, and completely destroy the flotilla of the enemy. The gallant admiral has detailed to the House some parts of903a plan which he tells ns is the production of his own brain, am! doubtless it is, from the specimen he has given us, a tolerably strong proof of his gallantry to own it. Without pretending to much nautical knowledge, one might, L think, question the correctness of the hon. admiral's ideas upon this project, for the practicability of making use of gunboats to annoy the flotillas on the French coast v, as denied by every intelligent naval officer; but, whatever is their use in the shoals along that coast, they surely are incapable of any degree of Utility, comparable to that which may be derived from large shipping upon our own coast. Wherever the latter can be employed, the former mast be comparatively useless. It is notorious that, all along from Pevensey to Dungeness, a man of war can anchor close in shop, sue is the depth of water. This, therefore, is the description of force upon which I would place my confidence, cither for attack or defence. As to the former, who can entertain a doubt that, if the French gun-boats should venture out, and the slightest breeze should arise, that Capt. Markham, whom I mention not as a member of Parliament, for that I know would be irregular, but as a naval officer, that Sir Ed. Peilew, Sir V. Trowbridge, or in fact, any officer known in our naval records, would not, with a single 74 shoot through and sink a crowd of that contemptible craft.&#x2014;With respect to the number of seamen and marines now employed, it has been staled by the right hon. gent, on the Treasury Bench, that there were 98.000, which is only 2000 short of the. whole amount voted; but the hon. gent. who spoke last is still dissatisfied. Fie says, that there ought to be more men. He does not seem to recollect, that the vote of the House limitted the Admiralty; and that it was at the time that vote was made the hon. gents objections would be most timely and proper. That was the period to consider the amount of the force necessary to maintain the war. The Admiralty had thought 100,000 men sufficient, and it appeared that they were right, notwithstanding the hon. gents disapprobation. They had, and it was not the least of their merit, collected this vast force in the space of 12 months, notwithstanding the number of our other descriptions of force, and without interrupting the active employment of our population, in the various avocations of commerce, manufactures and agriculture. To the observations of the right hon. gent., on the propriety of building ships in merchants' dock yards, I trust enough has been said by the hon. bart. (Sir Ed. Pellew), at whose presence this night the House has reason to904rejoice, to convince the right hon. gent, of his error, and also to shew him that his partiality to gun-boats is not quite so judicious as he imagined After what the hon. bart. has urged on this point, I should hope the right hon. gent, will no longer attempt to maintain his argument, unless he be influenced by such magnanimity, that he would not wish to oppose the French gun-boats by any but their own matches. I have heard a right hon. gent, on the lower bench (Mr. Windham) often deplore that \"the age of chivalry was gone;\" but surely that complaint can no longer be repeated, if the right hon. mover of the proposition before the House shall continue to manifest a wish rather to oppose gun-boats to those of the French, than to see a crowd of them run down by an English 74. This would be something like the feeling which I am sure would influence the right hon. gent, on the lower bench, if, in passing through the street, he should happen to see two men engaged of unequal size and strength. The right hon. gent, would immediately interest himself for the weaker party, and call into action that science for which he is so distinguished, to release, and perhaps to avenge him..&#x2014;To be serious: it is absurd to say, I that we should at once give up that formidable description of naval force, in which we have always found our strength and our glory, and take up another which is condemned, not merely by the experience to which I have already referred, but by the judgment of the most respectable naval officers. That this change too should be chosen, as the right hon. gent, recommended, merely in order to reduce us to a level with the French boats, for no other argument to support the choice has been advanced, really surprises me. It is something like this, that if we had a stone wall to defend us against the shot of an enemy, it should be recommended to us to throw down the wait and fling stones at our assailants. An anecdote has been very generally mentioned with respect to the right hon. gent who has commenced this debate: It is said that he proposed this sentiment&#x2014;\"The Volunteers, and a speedy meeting with the enemy on our own shores.\" This I toast, I understand, was proposed among a number of volunteer officers above 6 months ago, at a time when he volunteers, upon whom we are so much to rely for our security, could not be much acquainted with discipline, if, according to the right hon. gent.'s assertion, they are even now very defective in that respect. I am as ready as any man to pay a just compliment to the right hon. gent.'s active endeavours to pro-905mote the improvement of the volunteers. I acknowledge that his solicitude for their advancement and glory is considerable, and probably he wishes to remove any impediment in their way. His desire is, perhaps, that they should have a full opportunity of distinguishing themselves pursuant to the toast I have quoted. If such be his view, he certainly could not accomplish it by better means than by contriving to have the defence of our country committed to his favourite gun-boats, instead of men of war. Independently of the other objections which I have offered to those gun-boats, there is one which occurs to me of too much strength to be omitted, if they were of the same kind as those of the last war, any description of men would be good enough, or too good, for them; and if good men were required for them, they could not be had without deducting from the number necessary for our important shipping. Why, then, join with the corrupt band of detected speculators in censuring the Admiralty for not paying all the attentions which the right hon. gent, desired to these gun boats? A little consideration ought to be sufficient to prevent any man from complaining of that respectable Board&#x2014;that Board which is respectable in the estimation of all men but mistaken partisans or fraudulent contractors&#x2014;that Board which has had such numerous difficulties to encounter, all incurred by a solicitude to expose and punish fraud, to recover and to spare the public money. Has the right hon. gent, read the five reports from the commissioners appointed to inquire into the abuses committed in the several branches of the naval department? It so has he not there seen the foul corruption, the abominable artifice, with which the Admiralty has had to struggle? Has the right hon. gent, observed the frauds exposed in the second report&#x2014;the block and coopers contracts, where 2000l.have been paid for work proved not to be worth 200l.? Has lie read the description of the plunder practised on seamen by the prize-agents: and if so, can lie, can any man who loves the friends of his country and virtue, refuse his gratitude and admiration to the first lord of the Admiralty who originated this inquiry? an inquiry which has unto ed against him a host of enemies. They are enemies, however, which that noble lord must despise. It was but the prejudice of defeated vice against triumphant virtue It could not disturb the noble lord's mind. While he was only assailed by those worms who had fed and fattened upon the corruption of the navy&#x2014;while he had only to reckon, as his foes those who had proved themselves hostile to906honour and justice, who had enriched themselves on the spoils of their country&#x2014;while such only were his enemies, the noble lord would proceed in his course of glory as he did in the victory on the memorable 14th of February, 1797, disdaining and declining to retaliate their attack; but when the right hon. author of the motion before the House becomes his assailant, the noble lord must feel surprised. Even that right hon. gent. however, cannot injure him. His fame stands too high, his character is too firmly established, to be hurt by the assertions of any member, and I have no doubt that the noble lord will be ever found entitled to the applause and protection of his country.&#x2014;With regard to the right hon. gent.s recommendation, that shipping should be built in the I merchants dock yards, I shall only refer him to the ships mentioned by the hon. bart. and I also to the cases described in the reports of the commissioners of naval inquiry, particularly to the cases where it appeared that the persons who received payment for ships built in merchants yards were clerks in the King's dock-yards, is it possible, to suppose that collusions did not exist in such cases as these? The right hon. gent, has said, that it is impossible, during war, to build any number of ships in the King's dock-yards, and that therefore a necessity arises of resorting to the merchants yards. What a melancholy expression&#x2014;that in those yards, where there are 3,200 men employed, nothing more than the mere repair of ships could be done If so, then our surprise must be diminished, that a French fleet should have been permitted, in the course of the last war, to find its way to Egypt, and another French fleet to sail to Ireland, where nothing but the elements offered to prevent a formidable French army from landing. If, however, the King's dock-yards are really so little useful, or rather so useless, they ought to be abolished altogether. A new system ought to be adopted. If they could only finish in these I yards 24 sail of the line, 15 frigates, and some few sloops in the course of 20 years, although it is known that 45 shipwrights can build a 74 in one year, that there are 3,200 shipwrights in those yards, and that the expense, &c; could not be less in 20 years than 4,100.000l.a sum equal to the building of the whole navy of England, it follows, of course, that it is bad policy to continue the maintenance of these dock-yards. It is besides well known that the internal system of these yards is bad. There is no difference in the wages allowed to the workmen; the unskilful can earn as much as those of a different description. Thus emulation is-prevent-907ed, and many advantages, of course, lost to the employers. The right hon. gent, may answer this, and say, that, although so many abuses have been detected by the commissioners of naval inquiry, that still the system of the dock-yards is good: but I assert, and am prepared to maintain the assertion, that abuses pervade every department of the system. Does the right hon. gent, know of the frauds which the commissioners have found to have been committed in every article with which these yards are furnished, particularly blocks? From these abuses arise the necessity of advertising for contractors to build shipping; and as to correct them, to produce integrity and arrangement in all the departments of the navy, is and has been the great endeavour of the high character upon whom it appears to be object of the motion before the House to fix an imputation, I shall vote against it with as much satisfaction as ever I gave a vote since I had the honour of a seat in this House, fully convinced that such a motion is only calculated to gratify the corrupt, to frown upon reform, and to assail the reputation of a gallant officer, whose claims to the gratitude of the country can only be equalled by the esteem and attachment he enjoys among all that are great and good.", "author_id": "/people/mr-richard-sheridan-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1804", "mar", "15"], "content": "&#x2014;Sir; I feel myself placed in a situation somewhat extraordinary on this occasion. With a great part of what has been said on the merits of the first lord of the Admiralty, I am strongly disposed to concur, but at the same time, I cannot see how these arguments tended to the conclusion at which they arrived. My hon. friend near me (Mr. Sheridan) has made, as he always does, a speech of the utmost brilliancy and eloquence, in which, however, lie seems to me to have almost entirely omitted the reasons on which he was to negative the motion, and he contented himself with announcing the vote he was prepared to give. Though ready to give my ready assent to the distinguished worth and pre-eminent services of Lord St. Vincent, I feel that the best way I can testify my respect for such a character, is to give my vote for the motion. I feel that a slur thrown on the reputation of Earl Vincent, would be a loss to the country, and to remove every suspicion of that kind, I say, let there be ample means of inquiry afforded, so that the triumph of Lord St. Vincent may be the more complete, satisfactory and glorious. It appears to me that the defenders of Lord St. Vincent had but two courses which they could with propriety purpose, either to say that no case whatever had been made out, and then refuse all the pa-908pers asked, or to produce all the papers which could reasonably be asked for, and upon the consideration of those to call for the censure or the acquital of the House. But the. line of conduct which ministers have thought fit to take, does neither the one or the other. By granting some papers and refusing others, they admit enough to countenance the suspicion of something wrong in the naval administration, and do not go far enough to let that suspicion be wiped away. But the course which ministers have thought fit to adopt it is not difficult to explain. They wish to defend Lord St. Vincent as they would have defended themselves; they wish to put him on a level with them, to obtain the precedent of his great name to resist inquiry, so that every other inquiry may be frustrated; they wish to put him on a level with Lord Hardwicke, so that the refusal of inquiry in the instance of one that can bear it, may be an argument for setting inquiry aside when it might tend to produce discoveries they would suppress. The right hon. gent. who spoke first (Mr. Tierney) against the motion, agrees that the papers alluded to in two of the motions shall be granted; but he is of opinion that the third cannot be granted. If, however, to ask for any papers at all be to cast some slur on the first lord of the Admiralty, why are any papers granted at all? Or is it because those which are refused might lead to inquiry, that they are with-held? If this be the object of the defenders of Lord St. Vincent, I am confident that he must disclaim such a mode of proceeding. I am confident that he would countenance tip shuffling or evasion to suppress inquiry; and that he would not be content if he thought that it could be suspected he was adverse to have his administration canvassed. Thus ministers, knowing that the conduct of the first lord of the Admiralty is in every respect a contrast to their own, wish to make common cause with him, in offering a mode of defence to which, on a future occasion, they themselves may resort. Towards Lord St. Vincent I feel much personal friendship, and this renders; me anxious that his reputation should stand high; but public motives give me a still greater interest in his fame and honour. Of his glorious achievement on the I4th of February no man can think higher than I do; but his conflict with the abuses and corruptions of his department appears to me, though less brilliant, not less arduous and meritorious. On the 14th of February he engaged and vanquished the enemy; but he has waged a war no less difficult, with jobs, and contracts, and frauds. He Jus broken their em-909battled line, no less arduous than to penetrate that of the enemy. My admiration of him is increased to find him possess, in so high a degree, that which is more rare than gallantry in the field: civil courage and decision as well as personal courage. I feel that his virtues and public deserts in this contest with corruption have natuarally led to that obliquy by which lie has been pursued. The attempt to put to rout the hosts of corruption have created him enemies. Such may have been the persons from whom an hon. gent, opposite (Mr.Wilberforce) obtained the information he mentioned; but let the miserable witnesses be brought forward, that their testimony may be examined and disproved. This calls to my mind an anecdote of a risible nature. It happened that when Mr. Justice Willes, a man who to many eminent qualities added a considerable portion of humour, was one day employed in trying a cause, I believe of murder, and one of the witnesses deposed that a ghost had said so and so;&#x2014;\"O, very well, (said the judge), I have no objection to the evidence of a ghost; let him be brought in and sworn!\" So, provided the witnesses alluded to by the hon. gent, can be brought forward, I have no objection to receive their evidence at the bar of the House, that we may afterwards decide upon it.&#x2014;During the whole course of the debate,, the only person who has made any direct charge against the conduct of the Admiralty in general, is my hen. and gallant relation, (Admiral Berkeley), who spoke lately. As to the right hon. gent, who made the motions, I confess, that lie seems to me to have made out little or no case. With respect to the number of gun-boats in employment now and at former periods, the comparison affords no conclusion, unless it be shewn likewise that the exigency of the case was such, as to demand greater exertions and a greater proportion of this species of force. Unless too it can be shewn, that of gun-brigs a greater number ought to be employed, the late period at which the Admiralty made the contracts for such vessels proves nothing. The right hon. gen. likewise proposes to address the Crown, recommending greater exertions in this way; but any measures for the improvement of our defence must be left to those who are in official situations. But in viewing our state of defence, the great mind of the right hon. gent, must see that it must be judged of upon a general system, and not upon any particular point. It is impossible, but, that in viewing each point separately, there must appear to be some deficiency. It is evident, however, that some inferior parts must be910overlooked, in order that the perfection of the whole may be obtained; and I am inclined to think, that if there be any part of our defence which it was more safe to sacrifice than another, from its being of inferior moment, it is that of which the right, hon. gent, has insisted. Had the motion been for papers generally, I might have been a little puzzled to know how I should vote, though I believe I still should have voted for inquiry; but as the matter stands now I cannot hesitate. If the parpers are refused, it must infer some slur upon the first lord of the Admiralty; if some of these documents are with held, it may be said by the right hon. gent., that he was prevented from carrying the question he meant to move, because inquiry was suppressed, and he was denied the papers by which his case was to be proved. But, it is said, that if all the papers were granted, a suspicion would lie against the first lord of the Admiralty. But how long could such a suspicion continue? No longer, surely, than till the inquiry took place. But if any suspicion arises from the motion, or from the papers produced, it is impossible to say how long suspicion may remain, since no inquiry is allowed by which it can be removed. Ministers profess themselves friends of Lord St. Vincent in the present instance; bet how have they shewn themselves solicitous about the fame and the accommodation of that noble lord on other occasions? Do we not know, that, for at least eighteen months, a difference of the most serious kind, and to the impediment of public business, existed between the first lord and the secretary of the Admiralty? yet, that secretary preserved his place for a year and a half, under those very ministers who lately contended, that on account of a coolness between the lord lieut. of Ireland and the commander in chief there, it was impossible that the latter could, consistently with the public safety, remain in his place a week. I cannot help thinking, therefore, that the defence now set up by ministers, as rather intended to be a convenient protection to themselves for the future, than as any thing which Lord St. Vincent's case would require. If Lord St. Vincent's conduct, which would stand inquiry, is to be opposed to any inquiry, then will others avail themselves of the example, to contend that they too, though they declined investigation, were equally conscious of rectitude and merit. And is this the way to do honour to Lord St. Vincent's character and superiority? Indeed, that ministers look more to the benefit of the example than to the credit of the first lord of the Admiralty, appears to me from911the manner in which the motion had been opposed. It seems as if it were said, we will grant such papers as will not inculpate the first lord of the Admiralty, and do not lead to inquiry. Why, then, are others refused? Will it not be said, that they would have inculpated the Admiralty and led to inquiry? and this is the way in which Lord St. Vincent's reputation is to be defended by his colleagues. The same right hon. gent. (Mr. Tierney), to whose, defence of the Admiralty I have just alluded, says too, that there is no complaint against the Admiralty out of doors; and also, that the public are equally content with the whole conduct of the present ministers. As to the general character of ministers with the public I shall give no testimony; but if the conduct of ministers were to be the object of discussion, and decided by argument, it would not be difficult to shew what the public ought to think of them. This suffer me to illustrate by good humoured comparison, which on general principles often afford (he best illustration. In one of Moliere's plays, a grave old gentleman marries a young wife, or does something or other not very suitable to his character. Every body, however, is mightily content with what he had done, except that when it is mentioned every one burst out a laughing. In the same manner, though it happens that every body is so well content with the present ministers, yet when their merits are spoken of it generally produces a laugh, or at least a smile, on every countenance. Different indeed is Lord St. Vincent in this respect from ail his colleagues; and knowing that he is in every respect a perfect contrast to them in merit and reputation, they wish to bring him down to their level, or at least to shelter themselves under his great authority. But in order to strengthen the public confidence in Lord St. Vincent, let the administration of the Admiralty be examined, and the services of that noble lord will appear even more important than they have yet been estimated, in voting for this motion on these grounds, I am conscious that I do that which private friendship and public duty equally prescribe.", "author_id": "/people/mr-charles-fox-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

Had his friend by him tapped the right hon. gent, on the shoulder, and bid him look behind, that right hon. gent, would have seen a quondam friend, for whom, perhaps, he had not preserved all the attachments nor all the sympathies of friendship. Why should any wish exist to conceal the naval situation of the country? The more our state is known, the more respect will our naval force command. He could perceive915no ground of delicacy on this question, when our naval superiority was so confessedly admitted even by our enemies. The: more, in fact, our naval force is known, the more we must be dreaded. Nor could such an investigation as that proposed by the motion, give greater information to the enemy than what they already possessed, which was, he conceived, Oil information of our superiority. He would ask the House what had been the conduct of the Admiralty in regard to the most vulnerable part of the empire. Was it not he most judicious in every respect? Every person would admit Ireland to be that part of the empire which he had described, and the conduct of the Admiralty, in regard to Ireland, was the most satisfactory, and appeared, he could say from good authority, to those that were most interested in that part of the empire, to be best calculated for protection and security. What description of vessels did Ireland most require, or by what description of vessels had Ireland been so much satisfied? It was by large vessels that the shores of Ireland had been protected, and not by small craft, which seemed to be the object of those gentlemen to recommend; and Ireland, at the same time, it would be admitted, was the weakest part of the empire, and therefore the best criterion by which we ought to judge from experience of the best means of our defence. The hon. gent, was by no means anxious to go into comparisons, but at the same time no comparisons, he was certain, could determine in any way disadvantageous to the noble lord now at the head of the Admiralty. A force, he remembered, had hovered over the coast of Ireland for upwards of 17 days, under a former administration, with general Hoche at its head, which had not the weather prevented it from standing, might have been attended with more serious consequences, and which, during those \"days, was unmolested, or rasher undiscovered by any British fleet. Were comparisons to be made, and were he permitted to follow them up minutely, he believed they would terminate greatly in favour of the present Board of Admiralty in every respect: and feeling this with his hon. friend below (Mr. Fox), he could see no rational objection to the inquiry proposed. Should such an inquiry produce any effect to the enemy, it must be that only of deterring him from his fatal and ill-founded enterprizes, it must be that only, from the present state of our navy, of convincing the enemy that successful invasion was impossible, and that the attempt most be attended with discomfiture to themselves, If any ob-916jection was entertained to the conduct of the noble lord at the head of the Admiralty, it must be on account of that aversion he has discovered to every species of corruption, and his laudable determination to check and oppose it in every shape. On this account, therefore, he was glad to see that noble lord so warmly supported by the gentleman opposite, and professedly upon the same principle, because from this circumstance it was natural to conclude, that there was no corruption existing in any of the other departments of administration, or the noble lord could not have been the only one singled out as an object of persecution in this respect. He must again repeat, that in regard to policy, there could be no objection. The more the enemy shall know, the more he will fear, and lord St. Vincent will have an opportunity of vindicating more generally his conduct. For these reasons, the hon. gent, said, he would vote for the motion, not for an address to his Majesty to remove the present lord of the Adrmiralty, but for an inquiry by which he would be enabled to justify his conduct.", "author_id": "/people/mr-george-ponsonby-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

Now, however, 3 out of the 5 heads of information moved for were refused expressly, because they led to an inquiry into the conduct of that Board. It was impossible that any enemy of the noble lord who presided over the Admiralty could contrive to as-parse his character more than such conduct did. The Board was called on to assign a reason why they had not done as much for the defence of the country as other Boards had done in former times, and the necessary means of this inquiry were refused. One right hon. gent. (Mr. Tierney) had imputed to his right hon. friend the offence of damping the ardour of the country. He left it to the House to say, whether such was the tendency of his right hon. friend's conduct; and whether, on the contrary, he had not done every thing in his power to produce a contrary effect, and to put the country in a state of complete defence? It was also ininuated by another hon. gent. (Mr.Sheridan) that the motion had for its object to encourage and protect a set of correct contractors and jobbers. He appealed t the House, whether it was possible to attribute any motives of that kind to the mover? He was at a loss to conceive how the Chancellor of the Exchequer could assert, that the number of the917dock-yard men, was only 58 deficient, as, if his information on that subject were correct, the deficiency was near IICC. He did not see any objection to giving the House accurate information the subject, which might at some future period be moved for. It was certain that at the peace the Admiralty had reduced the number 400 below the usual peace establishment. This, he thought, should not have been done till our navy, worn by the length of service, was put in a complete state of repair: and particularly when, as ministers must have known, another war was impending.&#x2014;Much had been said of the impolicy of building ships in private yards; he should be glad, however, to hear what new ships were now laid down in the dock-yards, or what old ones were likely to be finished. A great many ships had been built in these private yards, and now a ship or two, the Ajax and Achilles, were; said to be defective, and that circumstance was gravely assigned as a reason for desisting in a long established and uniform practice.&#x2014;The motive of the present-motion he conceived to be to show that, our naval force was less than it ought to be. It did not confine itself to gun-boats, as it seemed to be understood, but applied equally to every degree of force, largo as well as small. The question seemed to be argued, as if his right hon. friend meant to call on the Board of Admiralty to dismantle the large ships, and only equip gun-boats his was; by it means his intention. Preserving ah the line of battle ships and frigates, it was to be seen whether an adequate number of small craft was provided for our defence; or, at least, as many as could have been produced. He admitted the great professional character of Lord St. Vincent, to which he was as inclined as any one to do justice, and also to his exertions in correcting the frauds and corruptions incident to the naval expenditures; but of his civil conduct he might possibly entertain a very different opinion. The object of the present motion related only to acts of omission. The time might come when a further inquiry might take, place into some circumstances in his conduct of actual commission, which not only affected the state of our naval defence, but was also very material with a view to the personal liberty of the subject.", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-sturges-bourne", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

In the early part of the debate, on hon. admiral had stated, that he thought there was no exertion on the part of the Admiralty. To that he would say, let him look at the state of the marine. That hon. admiral had also said, that he suspected the motions which had been made that night, did not go far enough in regard to making enquiries. If they did not, the same hen. admiral had told the House, that he himself had something to propose, which would carry the investigation still further. Far his part, he could not rightly conceive how that hon. admiral could possibly carry it farther than what had been done by the right hon. gent, who had made these motions. He thought that the present inquiry tended to nothing else than to injure, the first lord of the Admiralty. Without any disparagement to the right hon. gent. (Mr. Pitt), he might venture to say, that during the whole 17 years of his administration he had generally shewn himself to be inimical to making such inquiries, or entering into any investigations whatever. He, however, would, in justice to that right hon. gent, mention, that he remembered having, on one particular occasion, procured from him, with some difficulty, an old bundle of papers. He was not inclined to impute to that right hon. gent, any improper or personal motives in his proposed investigation, though he must own that it appeared some what curious, that he should now venture to become an accuser, and indulge himself in making motion after motion, and encouraging speech after speech, when it tended so evidently to injure others. So many motions were proposed for inquiries into the conduct of ministers, that there appeared to be no end to them. He could not bring himself to be convinced, that the right hon. gent, was really in ear-919nest on this occasion, on the contrary, he was inclined to think that he had brought such motions forward, in order to win some bet he bad entered into with some of his friends. It even appeared to him, indeed, that the right hon. gent, and his coadjutors were, or had been, in a similar situation to a certain celebrated female who had lately so much attracted the notice of the public; and that he had lately been troubled with a dream. Whether he had been dreaming about stupendous columns, about sugar canes, or of the western world, he could not take upon him to determine; but it seemed as if he had, like the lady alluded be, thrown aside the camphor bag, and welcomed opposition to his Majesty's ministers. It really appeared that the right. hon. gent, had not now a leg to stand upon. He had brought forward these motion1;, while, at the same time, he had stated, conscientiously, that the noble lord of the admiralty had done every thing. As for the coalitions which had been made, they seemed to have no other object than to fix disgrace upon his Majesty's own ministers; those very ministers who had, in spite of all allegations to the contrary, the utmost confidence of the people of England, and who have the votes of that House to support their just and proper administration. Where, he would ask, were we to look more properly than to that House for the real and confidential sentiments of the people regarding them? Had any petition been presented to the House from the inhabitants of the country, begging that the conduct of the noble lord, so often alluded to, should be strictly investigated, on account of suspicions attaching to him? No. There had been no such petitions; it had been only a whisper to the detriment of the noble lord; and he was inclined to suppose, that it had been upon that whisper alone, that the right hon. gent, and some members of that House, seemed disposed to attack him.", "author_id": "/people/mr-thomas-jones-2", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

They were only fit for assembling to protect the coast, and he could venture to say, that merchants vessels were never so well protected as at the present moment. In the year 1793, the number of vessels taken by the enemy was 418; in 1794. they were 484; in 1795, 493; and in 1796, there were no less than 793 vessels of various descriptions lost.

As long as eloquence shall consist of correctness of judgment, simplicity and truth, it will be admitted that the gallant admiral under the gallery (Sir E Pellew) has defended Lord St. Vincent with some of those rhetorical powers for which seamen are not always distinguished. He was one of those who considered, that of all others, a professional mail was the most suited for the high station occupied by Lord St. Vincent; and he deemed it as absurd to place a person in different habits in that situation, as to advance a sailor or a soldier to the highest rank in the Courts of British Jurisprudence.

Then, if that were to be the criterion, it seemed if those goods were carried in different ships, the complaint of inequality in taxation would disappear.

He should, however, state how the matter stood. The civil list was granted in Ireland an the 33d of the sing, and these provisions which were now under discussion, were enacted in lieu of those duties which subsisted before that time. His Majesty having given up the receipts of his revenue, the heriditary dues to the Crown had merged during that time; but the right to them was not disturbed, but was to revive in full force at the expiration of the term for which the civil list was granted; thus it was, that from year to year the heriditary duties to the Crown remained as it were in abeyance, during the continuance of this arrangement between the Crown and the public, but would revive again after the time had expired during which the agreement was in force. This bill was formed on the model of other bills which had passed from year to year in Ireland from that time, and this only to render permanent that system which had been adopted and annually passed in Ireland. The right of the Crown necessarily revives when the period arrived by which the arrangement was at an end; nor was there the least intention to the contrary. Thus the case stood 911 constitutional principles. Now, a certain portion of these duties was granted annually, some of which were now inserted in this bill, which was proposed to be permanent, and a certain proportion was omitted in this bill, such as the land and malt, that was an annual measure yet; and with regard to the other duties, it was proposed that they should be permanent, and they were, the consolidated fund of Ireland, charged with the interests of the national debt and also the civil list of his Majesty, and that of the proportion which Ireland was to bear of its contribution it was bound to make to the public burthen by the union, as well as all the pensions and other parliamentary payments that were to be made.

The subject he was convinced was deserving of consideration.&#x2014;With regard to the distress that prevailed in Ireland on account of the state of the circulation, he was sure no man who had not been in that country could form a just conception of it from any description, however accurate. There was not to be found in the country parts of Ireland, except in the North, any description of coin whatsoever, except some very bad copper; silver or gold there were none. But as something must be used for circulation, there were many persons who, without any capital whatsoever, set up a kind of banking shops, and issued notes of 6d.,of 1s.,and a note for 3s.6d.was considered as a very large one!654The difficulties and inconvenience which this occasioned to the higher classes of so ciety were very great indeed, but infinitely more so to the lower classes.

He did not, however, wish to be understood as meaning to express any conviction that would produce any practical benefit, which would remedy the evil which, was complained of. If the inquiry should be productive of any beneficial consequences, it would give him the most sincere satisfaction, and even if it should fail of the desired end, it might have this effect, that it would prove to the public the truth of the opinion which had been delivered by the best informed men upon this subject, viz. that for the evil of exchange there was no remedy in the power of Parliament. It would set the public mind at rest upon the subject, and the House would have discharged its duty with attention and with due regard to the interest of the people of Ireland. Every body would be satisfied with the degree of alleviation, if net of remedy, which this might produce, or they would be convinced, after full inquiry, that it was not possible to do any thing upon the subject.&#x2014;With regard to the circulation of Ireland, the House would bear in recollection, that this subject had not escaped the655attention of ministers. It had been repeatedly adverted to in the last session, and in the session before. In the last session an act was passed to prohibit the circulation of what was called silver notes in Ireland, from the 1st of Jan. 1804. The propriety of that act was at that time doubted, and as many Irish members were prevented from attending Parliament by their military duties, an act was passed at the commencement of this session to suspend the operation of that act for six months; so that it appeared that the statement of the right hon. gent, though true, had not escaped the attention of his Majesty's ministers.&#x2014;With regard to the at ate of exchange between Great Britain and Ireland, when it appeared that the balance of exchange was in favour of Ireland in those parts of that country where gold was in circulation, and that it was against Dublin, where there was only paper in circulation, the quantity of paper issued must be looked upon as one of the causes of the depreciation of paper. But besides this, there was, he was convinced, a very considerable degree of management in the subject of exchange. When the treasury of Ireland ceased lo draw upon this country for the amount of the loan, it was observable that the exchange rose considerably in four or five days. There were violent fluctuations of 2, 3, and even 4 per cent. He had, therefore, no doubt, but that a very considerable degree of management was used in creating these violent fluctuations of exchange, which were so advantageous to individuals.&#x2014;With regard to what had been said on the subject of remittances, there was one species of remittance to Ireland which had not been alluded to. The loan remitted from this country to Ireland certainly affected the immediate balance; but the fact was, that the expenditure in Ireland was greater than its contribution to the joint expenditure, of the United Kingdom. The consequence of that was, that very considerable sums were remitted to that country, and that was one reason why Ireland had been better able to go on than she otherwise would have done.&#x2014;Then was one subject adverted to by the right hon. gent, who had made the motion, upon which he could by no means agree with him. The right hon. gent, in stating the balance of trade to be against Ireland, had argued entirely upon what was called the original value, but it was perfectly well known that the official value was very considerably or low the real value. It was certainly true, that if gentlemen were guided by the official value of the exports, the balance of trade would appear to be against Ireland, whereas,656if they looked to the real value of the article exported, which certainly was the only true way of knowing whether the balance was for or against a country, the balance would appear to be in favour of Ireland. To illustrate this point, he would mention one or two instances. It was perfectly well known, that the second great article of export from Ireland was provisions. The barrel of beef exported from Ireland was valued in the official books at l6s.per cwt. whereas, in fact, the real value, that is to say, the real price at which it was exported was 25, 30, and even 40s.per cwt. In estimating the amount of the exports of a country, it was necessary to look to the real value, because that was the amount of the money that came into the country as the price of the article. With regard to pork, which was perfectly well known to be another great article of export from Ireland, the official value was 19s.per cwt., whereas the real price at which it was exported was 30, 33, and even sometimes up to 65s.per cwt. Butter, which was another great article of export, was stated according to official value at 42s.per cwt., whereas, in point of fact, it was exported at 70, 80, and even 105 per cwt. It was, therefore, a very unfair means of ascertaining the trade of a country to look merely to official value. It was true, that the real value of the imports was greater than the official value, but not in so great a degree as in the exports. \"Therefore Ireland was by no means in the desperate situation which had been represented by some gentlemen.

He could not omit this opportunity of adverting to an evil which was admitted on all hands to exist, and which passing under the eye of his Majesty's I ministers in Ireland, might be the more effactually remedied. He alluded to the excessive issue of country Bank paper. He should himself be the last to recommend any vigorous measures to restrain the operations of the private bankers, but he could not be persuaded of the property of forcing their paper into circulation. He understood that the military forces in Ireland were paid altogether in the paper of the country banks, and that an improper, he had almost said a corrupt connexion, existed between the agents employed in paying the military and yeomanry, and the bankers. As soon as these agents received their remitiances, they lodged them in the country bank, taking their paper in exchange for paying the forces, and the noble lord agreed that the Bank of Ireland paper became thus an additional capital to the country banker. In such a state of the country, he looked upon investigation, to the end or devising some remedy, as absolutely indispensible. Unhappy, indeed, must that situation of a country' be, which affords to the fraudulent an opportunity of deluding the unwary, and to the strong the means of oppressing the weak.&#x2014;He had but one observation more to make.

Though remedics had been mentioned out of doors, there however existed a difference of opinion with respect to them, and the noble lord thought that the best mode of coming to some agreement, with respect to the remedy of an evil universally allowed to exist, was to appoint the committee, and institute an open inquiry which would lead to a discovery of the best means of redress.", "author_id": "/people/lord-henry-petty", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

The directors of the Bank of Ireland had been attacked both in and out of that House: he had seen a pamphlet, written by a noble lord (King), nut a member of that House, which contained a most violent, unwarrantable, and unsuccessful attack upon that must respectable body of men, and the ground of attack was the great issue of paper. He did nor wish to occupy the attention of the House; but he was anxious to offer an observation that had occurred to him in regard to the subject now in discussion. To the Bank of Ireland no particular circumstances had occurred since the year 1797 that could affect their interests, but the restriction of their issues in specie. Since that restriction had taken place, however, some circulating medium became absolutely necessary, and the effects of this new circuiting medium were various, since that event, in particular, they had increased their capital to a very great degree. The situation of the country was such, the hon. gent. thought, that nothing but the restoration of tranquillity, and the gallantry of; his country toward In-land in money transactions, could effectually remedy those evils that were complained of.", "author_id": "/people/mr-quintin-dick", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

The low rate of exchange, so tin-favourable to Ireland, though owing much, he thought, to the present insecurity of that country, or, which was equally the same, to what might be thought its present insecurity, would be found to arise also from a number of other causes. To remedy those evils, however, he did not think it in the power of the legislative authority, and in many instances incompetent with the legal exercise of that authority. If the state of exchange between this country and Hamburg, or any other country in similar circumstances, was deemed an improper subject of legislative interference, he could see no reason why the interference of the legislature became necessary in regard to Ireland, or what good effects that interference could produce. The course of exchange in every country must necessarily depend on its trade. It must depend on the comparative state of its exports and imports, which, so far as was consistent with the fair exercise of trade, was by no means an immediate object of legislation. The course of exchange was not only now unfavourable to Ireland, but had been so for several years past. It was difficult to say if it was in the. power of legislation to apply any remedy without removing the original causes; the most important of which it was certainly not in the power of legislation to remove. Of these the absentee rents he regarded as none of the least important, and this cause of depression in the rate of Irish exchange, he conceived to be not greater at present than in the year 180J.&#x2014;Another cause of this depression also he conceived to be the present state of Ireland, as it stood in regard to the threatened invasion, and the necessary defence against the projects of a foreign enemy, as well as its own internal commotions. In this state of the country, while the men were employed in its defence, they often thought it prudent to place their wives and children in a place of security, and to convey what moveable wealth they could command in the same manner, or apply it in some other country to the support of their family. But when the people of Ireland came to have the same confidence in their money transactions, and in the stability of their circulating medium, as Scotland and the North of England possessed, the circumstances that were so unfavourable to the exchange of that country would, in a great measure, be diminished.&#x2014;To all the other causes he had mentioned, that want of confidence in their paper money was no inconsiderable addition, and this want of confidence, the hon. baronet contended, was660not a new or recent circumstance. The people of the north of Ireland, even in times of peace, have been long in the habit of carrying on no trade but through the medium of specie. They have been long in the habit of rejecting paper, and their articles being generally necessary, it has become customary not to tender it. This prejudice in the north of Ireland might be owing to their foreign connexions, or to their more immediate relations with Scotland and England, but must have a tendency to drain the specie from the other parts of Ireland, and to diminish the respectability, and, therefore, the value of the paper currency. The people in the north receive nothing but gold; as their articles are necessary they must have it, and by thus drawing the current specie to one part of the kingdom must injure the rest. he hon. baronet was anxious that nothing violent should le adopted, that the measures adopted on the subject ought rather to have a tendency to assist the natural course of things and to remove obstructions, than to give any new or unnatural direction to existing circumstances.&#x2014;The hon. baronet concluded by expressing his hope that the committee moved for would take up the question in its proper light, and would not dissolve themselves till they had placed the Bank of Ireland in such a situation, as enable them to have some control over the private banks, and to check, in some measure, the issue of paper by every private person who chose to start up and call himself a banker, without any other qualification or security but the power of adding to the paper currency of the country.

Nothing, he was sure, would give his noble friend more pleasure than to have his opinions closely investigated. The House ought, he thought, by all means to go into a committee on the subject in question. The more such subjects were discussed so much the bitter. He had no idea of that662security or confidence in any set of principles, or in any measures, that were the result only of silence, and that must fall to the ground the moment such principles are discussed or examined. He denied that the legislature could not interfere with advantage in regard to the rate of exchange between other countries and this. An hon. baronet had proposed, as an argument against legislative interference in the instance now before the House, that it would be equally improper, and attended with no greater advantage to interfere in the case of Ireland than in the case of Hamburgh, or any other country less connected with the empire than Irleand. But he would remind the hon. baronet, that about 32 years ago the legislature had interfered in regard to the state of exchange between this country and Hamburgh, which was precisely the instance which the hon. baronet had said would, in his opinion, be equally fruitless or improper as our interference with Ireland. Yet in 1772, when the exchange between this country and Hamburgh was unfavourable to this country, and the coin of this country was so debased that it was received at inferior value at Hamburgh, the legislature thought proper to interfere, and give the coin of this country a nominal value equal to that of Hamburgh, which, so far from being attended with any disadvantage, had the desired effect.&#x2014;In respect to the currency of Ireland, it was not the guinea that was raised, but the paper that was depreciated. It was not the guinea that was worth 2s.more, but the paper that was regarded as so much less. The great object, therefore, ought to be, to adopt some effectual measure to support the paper currency of Ireland, and for that purpose to find out the cause of its depreciation. The country, he believed, was exceedingly obliged to the right hon. gent, who proposed the question. He thought the House and the country were indebted to the right, hon. gent, who had brought forward the motion, and concluded by hoping, that the pamphlet alluded to might be taken into the committee, and the arguments of his noble friend refuted or established.", "author_id": "/people/mr-charles-fox-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

Equally astonished was he, that when the question was on the propriety or impropriety of continuing the restriction on the Bank of Ireland, which necessarily involved the consideration of the comparative issue of paper in both countries, that his Majesty's ministers should refuse the House a document so necessary to the foil and just investigation of the subject before them. As to the noble lord's disapprobation of bringing forward the motion of which he had given notice previous to the recess, that surely would have to tendency on the present question.

He on the contrary, would seek safety in a different mode of conduct. He would examine oar situation in all its dependencies, and not shrink from the inquiry with timid apprehensions that the country was unequal to its trial. This direct and open mode of proceeding was the only one be could inspire solid confidence. Let ministers recollect what might soon be our state. Supposing as invasion actually had taken place, the soldiers that were to repel it must be paid in cash. Was it therefore needless or too early to enter on an inquiry that would ascertain what dependence we could have on that fund which was to constitute the source of our security? If half the taxes were paid in cash, that would be sufficient for all necessary purposes. If less than half, and the rest in bank notes, then it would behave the legislature to advert to the security of the Bank, and should any considerable proportion be paid in private paper (and his lordship was convinced that more than half was) then would it seriously concern the government of the country, to adopt some measure that might extend to private paper a kind of common security. If the taxes were in a great proportion paid in private bills, let the House consider what must become of the public income, in case the enemy effect a landing.

He was sure that every noble lord in the House heard the noble Secretary's answer with the highest satisfaction, and every individual in the country must also feel the same satisfaction, and the most lively gratitude to Providence, at the consoling intelligence, that the Sovereign, whom all loved and revered, was again in a636situation to exercise his royal functions. It was well said, that the most awful responsibility rested upon ministers, in case of their misleading the public; but, he could not believe, that they could possibly forget their duty to their country and their Sovereign so completely, as to forward any important measure, or give it the royal sanction, unless they were in possession of that confidence with his Majesty, which would enable them to obtain his consent and approbation, which alone gave any consequence to their official situation in the eyes of the public. The noble Sec. had said, that there was at present no suspension whatever of the royal functions. He would mention to the House how he understood this declaration. When, previous to this period, the public mind had been alarmed with the unwelcome accounts of his Majesty's illness, both Houses of Parliament had provided what was to be done on such an occasion, if such should in future occur. The state of convalesence of his Majesty, which would render any interference of Parliament unnecessary, was then settled to he at that particular point, when his Majesty should not be disabled, by his indisposition, from coming down to his Parliament. This was not the passing words of a speech, or any opinion actually given, but it stood upon the records of Parliament. So far, then, the records of Parliament precluded all necessity of discussion upon the subject, and fixed the precise stage of indisposition, when the interference of the legislature became necessary. From the declaration which the noble Sec. of State had now made, we understand, with the settled rule of Parliament on this subject in view, that his Majesty was, now completely restored to that degree of health and vigour, which enabled him to come to his Parliament, and in the exercise of the royal functions personally transact the business of the nation. Understanding the noble Sec. in this sense, and if his idea was wrong he wished to be corrected, he could not but most heartily partake in the high satisfaction which the House, and the nation in general, must feel at such an unexpected account of his Majesty's state of health. He rejoiced, that at this tremendous crisis, when we were menaced with a formidable invasion, our efforts were not likely to be damped by sorrow at the heavy calamity of our Sovereign's indisposition. He hoped no point of false delicacy had induced ministers to make this declaration, and that they would recollect, that while they performed their duty conscientiously to their Sovereign, they had also a duty to perform to the public. Heartily must their lordships, and the whole body637of the nation, thank the noble lord who had put the question in this House which had Jed to an answer so well calculated to spread joy and delight over this country. The subject was, no doubt, delicate, and none felt it more than he did; but, he would ill understand his duly to the legislature and the public, and even to his Sovereign himself, who had proved, on many occasions, that the love of his people and their happiness, were dearer to him than life itself, who should allow any notion of false delicacy so far to weigh in his mind, as to carry on the usual business of the nation, and to transact the most important measures, with the knowledge that there was, in fact, no executive government. He, therefore, highly approved of what the noble lord had done, and he would have been the last to approve of any discussion on such a subject, if he had not been convinced that it was demanded by a sense of duty to every part of the government and the nation. He had explained already what he understood by the answer which the noble Sec. of State had given to the noble lord who sat near him. He had mentioned what the records of Parliament required on this subject, and this was the criterion by which he must judge of the declaration of his Majesty's state of health. He was satisfied that the noble Sec. had no intention to lead the legislature and the public into an error on this important point. If he were not satisfied on this head in his own mind, he could not agree that Parliament should proceed to any other business till the subject of his Majesty's indisposition was inquired into; but, understanding the noble Sec. in the sense to which he alluded, he most willingly gave his consent to the 2d reading of theIrish Bank Restriction Billon Monday.", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-grenville", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},

In that rule it appeared, that the particular point at which the interference of Parliament should be considered as necessary, was, when his Majesty was in such a slate as precluded his coming down to his Parliament, and transacting the business of the nation. When the minds of the public were filled with grief and alarm, at the indisposition of his Majesty at two former periods, this rule had been adopted and written in the Parliamentary Records, in order to form a guide to the legislature and the ministers how they were to act in the event of such a case happening again.

The hereditary revenue of the Crown took its origin in Ireland about the same period as in this country, and is, perhaps, more extensive there than here; he meant, he said, in its operation. The right hon. gent. here mentioned several duties which were rot known in this country. For the defence of the country there was also an excise inland and import, and for defending the seas, as it was called, customs had been granted. But it was not till the reign of Charles the II. that any hereditary or private revenue had been granted to the Crown. In the 14th and 15th of Charles II. duties had been granted for this purpose on teas and tobacco. A duty of 2&#x00BD;d per lb. on tobacco was granted to Charles II. Additional duties had been granted also to William III. on the same article, but with a clause, at the same time, declaring 2&#x00BD;d per pound, as formerly, the hereditary duty, and were continued so till theConsolidation Act, in the 31st of the present King, when 2&#x00BD;und was again declared to be the hereditary duty, and those additional duties were supposed to expire on the demise of the King. In the 31st of the King also a civil list was granted to his Majesty, on the same principles as in this country; and this civil list was considered as an equivalent for the hereditary duties belonging to the Crown, and as accepted instead of them. That they might have the hereditary revenue in their own power, they entered into a contract with the Crown. Whatever the amount of the hereditary revenues might be, they thus reserved the power of increasing or diminishing, or otherwise modifying them. After the civil list had been thus established, other additional duties were granted sessionally, some, times for 5 years running. These were at first granted triennially, when Parliament was triennial; and afterwards annually; but uniformly the same clause in regard to the 2&#x00BD;d per pound on tobacco, as the hereditary duty, was inserted, for which no consent of the Crown was ever asked or841given. For this reason the right hon. gent. conceived, that the precedents of the Parliament of Ireland would by no means justify any objection of that kind that was brought forward. In the 14th and 15th of Charles II. a duty of 6 per cent, had been laid on tea. That duty continued to be Leviedad valoremaccording to the old book of rates, till Geo. II. when a new bock of rates was made out, and a new duty on tea, higher in proportion to its raised value in the new book of rates. This continued till the 7th of the King, when, instead of a dutyad valorem.it was enacted that a duty of 4d. par pound on the black, and 6d. per pound on the green should be levied. The duty on the whole might amount to 10,000l. but it was enacted that 7,300 l. should be the hereditary portion dne to the Crown. This was done without the Crown having signified any consent to Parliament. Tobacco and tea were thus the only two articles from which the hereditary revenue was supposed to arise; and in order that the hereditary part of the revenue might not be affected, a permanent rate had been fixed, so that any deficiency might be made up to the Crown, and that the surplus, when any, might be applied to the public service. These annual duties, the right hon. gent. further insisted, had even been continued three different times since the union, without any intimation from the crown. The right hon. gent. (Mr. Foster) who had managed those revenues, which were now entrusted to him, would feel, he flattered himself, the justice of what he had said. His recollection and greater experience would enable him even to corroborate more strongly his statement. But not only were the precedents of the Parliament of Ireland in favour of his mode of procedure, but those of the British Parliament also, in relation to the same subject. A case perfectly the same had occured in the 37th of the King, in regard to the consolidated fund, when it was enacted that a certain fixed sum should belong to the Crow, and that the surplus should go to the public service. The consent of the Crown on this occasion was not asked, nor was such a previous step deemed necessary to enable Parliament to proceed.&#x2014;Should any gent, however, be disposed to attribute this circumstance to want of attention in the House, and still insist that it was a step previously necessary to obtain his Majesty's consent, he would by no means resist the proposition, nor could he have any objection to consult the Crown an a subject of this nature.", "author_id": "/people/mr-isaac-corry", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

He felt himself, however, superior to such cold considerations, and would prefer, what he thought the strict rule of duty, to every thing else, assuring the House that whatever danger might threaten the country, how great so ever it might be, and come when it would, he would be as ready to shed the last drop of his blood in its defence, as any man living in it. A right hon. gent. (Mr. Pitt) had said, some short time past, that we were now engaged in a war, which the youngest man in the House might not live to see the end of. Another gent, had said, the volunteers could not be roughly handled. He, for his own part, had, in a very early period of the peace, recommended it to his Majesty's ministers to keep up a very large military force. He had stated in shies place, in that House, that we were 15 millions of people, possessed, it was true, of as much spirit, courage, and enterprise as any men on the earth, but composing, generally, a commercial community: that we had been placed, by Providence, directly opposite to a nation consisting of forty-five millions, almost entirely a military people, and headed by most active and ambitious officers. He, therefore, had given it as his opinion, that our military force should be increased and placed upon a most respectable footing. To the present system he was ready to give all due credit, as calculated to repel a sudden invasion or attack; but it became the duty of ministers, when they found the enemy had laid his plan, and taken his measures on the most extensive scale, and had collected one of the largest932armies in the world, to endeavour to meet him with such a force as should be most likely and best calculated to act against him on as equal terms as possible. When he was first appointed to the Severn district, he had endeavoured, as much as was in his power, to make the volunteers acquainted with all those man&#x0153;uvres and different modes of turning out of their quarters, and meeting at distant places with other corps, as were most calculated to be serviceable to them in case of any sudden appearance of the enemy but he found them in such a state of insubordination that he could not send a soldier five miles to execute any order of his, because the horses of the yeomanry corps were not found by government. He by no means intended to charge this state of insubordination as a fault of his Majesty's ministers, but he could not avoid stating it as a very momentous and radical defect in the system. In consequence of this refusal to convey his letters, as lieutenant-general of the Severn district, Col. Peach's battalion of 500 fine young men actually marched thirty-five miles, in order to meet some other corps on the West Downs, because he could not get a letter conveyed by a light-horseman to apprise the colonel that the meeting was put off from the unfavourable state of the weather. At the time he thought his letter had gone, he was surprised to find it sent back to him, with information that the officer to whom he had entrusted it, could not get it forwarded. He wrote immediately to the adjutant-general, requesting him to lay the business before government, and in about ten days he received a cold phlegmatic answer, not to give himself any farther trouble in the business, for he had nothing to do with the volunteers. He thought, therefore, it was of little consequence appointing field officers as inspectors of corps, if such kind of proceedings were to be looked over, and allowed to go on.&#x2014;The general then mentioned a corps, called the Selwood Forest Legion, which had actually refused to obey' the orders of the general of division, or the lord-lieutenant, or any orders but those of their own officers. He had lamented this state of insubordination, and implored them to attend to their duty, but all in vain; for they afterwards showed so mutinous a spirit, that they said they would rather fight it out on the parade, than yield precedence to any other corps, or submit to the orders of the lord-lieutenant, or general of division, and then actually formed themselves into an independent corps. He made a report of this alarming procedure to the War-Office, which was not attended to for a mouth, and then933he received a letter from the secretary of state, desiring that the business might be amicably arranged; so that insubordination, bordering on mutiny, was to be commuted by ail amicable arrangement.&#x2014;The next object in the system, which he disliked, was the exemptions. In the battalion of reserve, which he commanded in his district, there was a deficiency of 699. On inquiry into the cause, the answer was, they cannot be obtained on account of the numerous exemptions allowed to the volunteers. In the militia in his district, which now consists of two battalions, they were very short of their complement, and from the same cause. It was the same case, also, with the Second Will shire Legmen t0, which was commanded by as active, zealous, and enterprising a nobleman as any in the kingdom, the Earl of Pembroke, who gave the same reason for not being able to complete it.&#x2014;He now came to notice the army itself; and the recruiting parties had not obtained a tenth of what was wanted. In Marlborough there were 28 parties, and they had obtained to recruits. In Birmingham there were 11 parties, and but of recruits among them all. In short, the whole regular army was at a stand in respect to recruiting, merely owing to the very numerous exemptions which included the whole of the first class of the country. It was time, therefore, that we should rouse from our lethargy. We must not remain supine and idle, as we have been. He would, therefore, humbly propose, that since our engagements are such as nothing but a serious conflict can settle, we ought seriously to think of pouring some life's blood into the army, by filling its ranks with some of the youth and strength of the country. He was sorry to say there was something like compulsion in what he had to offer; but when every thing near and dear to the country; when its first and fairest interests were at stake, it was absolutely necessary to resort to measures which seemed to partake of coercion. He would therefore advise, that a revision should take place of all the ballots which had hitherto been made, in order to fill up the army; something like the first class of men, who were intended to be raised under the defence act. He would not suffer a single man to go out of the country, till our defence was fully provided for, or the necessity for it was over. He would not allow a single soldier to be sent on any quixotic expedition abroad, but he would concentrate our whole force at home, and place it on such a footing, as would enable us, in case the enemy landed, to give him such a reception, as he would not easily get ever.934Although, he said, the country might sustain a shock, he would wish ns to live like Englishmen, and like Englshmen to die. He did not find himself at all bigotted to his plan, but had merely thrown it out for the consideration of the House.&#x2014;He owned he was not favourable to the volunteer system; but if it should be the opinion of the House, that it was proper to continue it, he would wish to see it put on an efficient footing.

This he conceived to be a breach of faith, and ought not to be countenanced. You first tell the men, when they enter, that they have a right to resign; then comes the attorney-general, with an opinion, that they have not, such right; then comes the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, that they have the right; afterwards this act avows distinctly that right; and now comes this provision, which clogs and binds up the will and right of the individual in the offer of a majority to serve during the war.

A volunteer, he observed, might be absent for very good reasons, so long that it would be impossible for him, in the course of the year, to make out the number of days required by the act for his exemptions. He also might be confined by sickness in such a manner that he should never be able to come out, even once in the year. Yet in both these cases no provision was made in the bill for the exemption of such persons, which, if exemptions were to be granted at all, was a very great injustice, lie observed, in the bill, that a commanding officer was subjected to a penalty if he made a false return, and yet he was subjected to no penalty, for making no return at all, and the volunteers, therefore, by his neglect, might, in some instances, be deprived of their claim to exemption&#x2014;With respect to the power granted to the commanding officers of dismissing members from their corps, he wished to know, whether it was intended that he should have this power, notwithstanding any rules to the contrary, in the corps, which had not undergone an examination by his Majesty?&#x2014;Another thing which he thought unjust was the power given to the commanding officer, of disallowing to any member of his corps, one of his days of drill, upon his supposing that he had not behaved properly. A fault of a very trifling nature, therefore, might be of serious consequence to the volunteer, by depriving him of his exemption. He also thought that point extremely objectionable which went to allow the commanding officer to keep a volunteer in a state of arrest during the time of the drill. This as it appeared to him, would be cither ridiculous or dangerous, by excising a spirit of resentment in the corps. He also was of opinion, that the control of masters over their servants and apprentices, ought not to be removed in any respect, as it might be productive of a great deal of inconveniences, The servants and apprentices thinking it good fun, perhaps, to go a volunteering, might insist upon going at the very tints when it would be most inconvenient937for their masters. All this was totally unnecessary, as there were abundance of volunteers without the necessity of removing this control. He observed that the point relating to the payment of fines were worse than before; for now there was no imprisonment at all, but merely a double fine and a distress after 7 days notice, which, in the case of many volunteers, would be nothing else than telling them to run away.

His principal reason for wishing it to be recommitted was what might induce some gentlemen to oppose it altogether; viz. that if it is passed in its present form, it would make the ministers, and what was worse, the legislature, appear contemptible in the eyes of this country, and of foreign countries. The volunteer system, whether it was good or whether it was bad, was admitted, on ail hands, to form a considerable part of the defence of the country; and it was admitted, even by ministers, that the system was one which required revision and alteration. Parliament met on the 13th of November; they had now reached the 10th of March, and the only measures that ministers had taken for the defence of the country, was the bill before the House.&#x2014;We know that the enemy have made preparations for the invasion of this country,941gigantic beyond all former precedent; we were told by the secretary of state, that those menaces were immediately to he carried into execution; we know, that upon the issue of this contest, depends every thing that can be dear to men; and yet, after a session of above four months, the only measure of defence that ministers have brought forward is this bill. Gracious God, Sir, what is there in this bill? No steps have been taken to recruit the army, no means have been taken to improve or complete the army of reserve; all, all has rested upon the volunteers; and this is the bill which ministers have proposed for the completion of the volunteer system. Let any man, the most blindly attached to this bill, be asked, what is its chief merit? and he will say its, that it does that which it was at first professed that it would do, viz. nothing. Mr. Fox said, he liked the volunteer system, because he knew the spirit, the zeal, and the courage of the men who composed that body; no man could deny that the volunteers would be highly useful in the defence of the country, on account of their readiness, their spirit, and their numbers; but did this bill assist them in any of these points? Certainly not. After the time which ministers had taken to prepare the bill, it was natural to suppose that at least they would have considered the regulation they meant to propose; but was that the case? It now appeared, that in case of any attempt upon Ireland, and that an insurrection in that country should unfortunately be the result, all the volunteers of this country might be called oat, and placed under martial law, and must continue soldiers to all intents and purposes while that insurrection lasted; was such a thing ever in the contemplation of the volunteers? But it now seemed that it was to be given up, and certainly better late than never; but this was the system ministers had always pursued with the volunteers; they had done every thing to damp, to check, to harass them; as soon as they were beat from one trench by the volunteers, they took post behind another; and so they were beat out of trench after trench, and still they seemed determined to die as it were in the last ditch. This was the case with regard to the power of resignation; upon this subject the chancellor of the exchequer had, as usual, no opinion; however, he asked the attorney general, who it appeared had a wrong opinion: it was however circulated through the country by the ministers, who professed that they had at the same time an intention of bringing in a bill to give the volunteers a power of resignation, and they wisely wait-942ed till the decision of the Court of King's Bench had rendered such a bill unecessary. First of all it was intended that the volunteers might resign, then the attorney general was of opinion that they could not resign, then the Court of king's Bench determined that, they could resign, then the ministers bring in a bill professing to give them the power to resign, and then they insert a proviso in. this bill which in many cases will render it impossible for them to resign, and he had no doubt it would end in their giving up the proviso and saying they had a power to resign. He preferred going into the committee again, because there were many other objectionable clauses; one of them was the clause which took away the exceptions if a man did not attend a certain number of days; but it professed to restore the man to his exemption if he afterwards attended his full number of days; but how was this possible if the corps had been out their full number of days? Was the corps to be called out 8 or 10 days more, to give this man an opportunity of making up his regular number of days? that could not be intended; then it was mere deception to tell a man that it was in his power to recover his exemption. The clause which relates to contracts between masters and servants was equally liable to objection, because it would be a very serious thing in the country to take a servant away from a farmer for 40 days; but that which related to apprentices was still worse. It was an undoubted point that the labour of the apprentice belonged to the master, but this bill took away the apprentice from his master for 40 days. But it would be said, that a compensation was given, and to whom was it given? to the master who had a right to the labour; no, to the apprentice, who was seduced and paid for neglecting his master's labour. Another objection which had been taken by an honorable friend of his, and which had not been answered was, that which rendered the men of any corps liable to all fines and subscriptions agreed to by the majority. There were a great many other objections, but it was unnecessary to repeat them; he had stated enough to shew the necessity of recommitting this bill. What situation would they stand in if this bill were to pass in its present form? It would be this: that Parliament had now sat above 4 months, at a time when this country was threatened with the most formidable invasion that ever any country was threatened with, and that the only measure they had taken for the public defence was, that the volunteers should to exercised 20 days in the year more than before, for this was in fact the only essential943clause in the bill. What would the people think? Would they no! suppose, that the story of invasion was only invented to put them on their guard, and that Parliament did not seriously believe it; for they could never suppose, that Parliament would hare thrown away so much time about this bill, if they really expected an invasion, without taking one step to recruit the army of to improve the army of reserve. The volunteers might be like a regular force, in bravery he was sure they would, but then the country would have nothing else, they would have no levy en masse to support them. Every strong arm, every willing heart in the country, that was not it a volunteer corps, would be completely useless in the hour of danger, and they would be in the situation described by a right hon. gent exclaiming, when the enemy landed, \"I am desirous to serve my country, but I know not what to do!\" The volunteers! were, certainly in a different situation, but he believed three-fourths of them had never fired with ball. He also understood, that in many counties they had not received above 14 or 15 rounds of ammunition; and he instanced the county of Wilts in particular. He was one of those who did not think the danger so great as others; but it certainly was an awful crisis, and he only begged the House to compare the danger with which we were threatened, with this bill, which was all that ministers had prepared to meet it.&#x2014;The poet had well said, on another subject, \"he trembled, when he compared the punishment with the crime,\"&#x2014;meaning how little the one was proportioned to the other. He would say a he, that he trembled, when he compared our danger with cur means of defence. It was impossible to make that comparison, and not to tremble. But, said Mr. Fox, I tremble less, because I do rely upon the volunteers, because I do believe that hot the constant bickering which ministers have had with them, not their fighting with them point after point, and being beat out of trench after trench, not all the contention and litigation which, ministers have had with them, not all the damps and checks which have been thrown upon them, not the refusing their zealous offers of service, not the neglect in furnishing them with ammunition; I do not tremble so much, I say, because I do believe that even all these things cannot destroy the spirit of the country, which will, I am sure, not only rise superior to every effort of the enemy, bin I am even sanguine enough to believe (and I cannot reach a higher climax) that it will rise superior to the weakness, the incapa-944city, and the imbecility of the present ministers.", "author_id": "/people/mr-charles-fox-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

This was a question, in his judgment, of infinite importance, and demanding the most attentive inquiry, inasmuch as it was the commencement of a system, the effects of which would grow on us every day; for the more we advanced in such a situation, the more difficult it would be to change; and, therefore, the947farther we proceeded, the stronger would the argument become which was relied upon so much this night, namely, that we had gone too far to recede. For this reason, it was his anxious desire, that we should stop, as soon as possible, the progress of a system so defective, so radically inefficient. When arguing against this system, he wished to correct an error that seemed to prevail in the minds of some gentlemen, that, he and others who joined with him, meant that the volunteers should be disbanded. Nothing could be more erroneous than this idea, for, on the contrary, the principal objections which he and the gentlemen with whom he acted, had to this measure, and which he hoped would not be considered inconsistent, were these, that it would produce the dissolution of the greater part of the volunteers, while it would go to render the volunteer system permanent.&#x2014;With respect to the motion immediately before the House, he would admit the justice of the remark, that new clauses might be proposed and adopted without recommitting the bill; but yet he W3s for going into the Committee, and for this plain reason, that a Committee was the natural and proper place to discuss such clauses. An hon. gent.(Mr. Sheridan),had urged that it was unnecessary to go into the Committee, as ministers had manifested such candour as left no room to doubt of their readiness to accede to any necessary amendment that might be proposed in this stage of the bill. The hon. gent, however, had probably experienced such candour in his Majesty's ministers, in return for the candour which he had shewn towards them for some time back, as justified, in his mind, the compliments he appeared so strongly disposed to pay them.

He confessed that he felt no surprise at the uneasiness which Ministers betrayed by their cry for the question to get rid of the measure before the House. It had certainly given them much trouble, and was likely to give I them and the country much more. They might, however, state, as a justification for the silence which they seemed willing to preserve upon this occasion, that all the arguments used by his hon. friend who had just sat down had been advanced before. This might be for the most part true, but he would ask, whether those arguments had ever been answered, and whether they did not remain entirely unrefutad? If so, then, they ought to be repeated, in order, if possible, to persuade the pertinacious adherents of this dangerous system to yield to their force, and to resort to measures more consonant to wisdom, and better calculated to secure the safety of the country. But, perhaps, Ministers had exhausted their eloquence upon this subject, by the four-and-twenty new clauses which they had introduced, and being tired of amendment and re-amendment, of commitment and recommitment, of propositions and recantations, were anxious to send the measure out of the House, without any more words about it. To their wishes, however, he was not disposed to yield, and as this was perhaps the last opportunity of speaking upon this bill, he would avail himself of it to enter his solemn protest against a measure which he thought, if persisted in, would lead to little short of absolute ruin. This sentence, however harsh, he could not hesi-973tate to pronounce, as the full conviction of his mind. The Mouse, he observed, had never yet taken a distinct view of the question. One way of shewing what the question was, was to shew what it was not. It was not a question between volunteers and no volunteers; between a system such as was now proposed, and no system at all; between the present bill and a total absence of that force to which the present bill was meant to apply. Any gent, might easily satisfy himself upon that point, by only considering whether he should suppose, if the present bill had never been brought in, that all volunteer force would have ceased. The bill, there-lore, was not necessary to theexistenceof a volunteer force; its object both was and professed to be, to improve a force of that description which already subsisted, and which would continue to subsist though no such bill should be brought in: and the objection on the part of himself and others who thought with him on this occasion, was, that the improvement to be obtained was in many of its parts doubtful, that it was not applicable to much of that for which it professed to be intended, and that it was at all events not worth the price that must be paid for it: for that independent of other considerations, though the bill might in the end do something for bettering the volunteers, it would in the mean while operate most injuriously on every other species of force, and finally deprive us of that species which was confessedly the most valuable, lie meant a regular army. This was the view to be taken of the question, and these the several points of comparison, by the result of which the question must be determined.&#x2014;To assist the judgment of the House in forming that comparison, it would be right to consider some of the general reasonings on which all the measures adopted for some time past seemed to have been founded.&#x2014;These would for the most part, be reducible to the three or four following propositions: 1st, that the prospect of an immediate attack from the enemy, though not absolutely certain, was so nearly so, that persons must act precisely as if its certainty was assured to them, 2dly, that this danger, thus certain and immediate, was of a nature so disproportionate to every other, that nothing could be allowed to come in competition with it, or could be regarded for the time otherwise than as it could be made consistent with that great974and over-ruling object, 3dly, That the improvement of the volunteers was, in the actual state of things, the means most effectual that could be taken for guarding against this danger, and, consequently, must be pursued, even supposing (what was not admitted) that it was injurious in many other respects, and was inconsistent with those provisions and establishments which would be most conducive to the safety of the country in future. These propositions, every one of which ought to be true, to support the measures which had been built upon them, were nevertheless, he would venture to say, every one of them false. To the. first, which said that such was the probability of an immediate attack, that our conduct must be the same as if the event were certain, the answer was, that our language and our actions were wholly at variance with each other, and that nothing could be more, evident, than, that while we talked this language, we ourselves had no belief in the truth of it; for that, if we had, it was impossible to suppose that we should content ourselves with such precautions merely as those which we were taking. It was in vain, therefore, to attempt to rest any measure upon the ground that we were to consider the present danger, otherwise than as one which, though probable in a high degree, might nevertheless not happen.&#x2014;The other proposition, that, namely, which related to themagnitudeof the danger, which would confine the whole of our thoughts and exertions to the business of present defence, and would allow of no competition between that and any other object, was a question of somewhat greater extent, and required a more particular examination. It was always forgot or dissembled in talking upon this subject, that cases of present danger were to be distinguished into two sorts, viz. those in which the danger being present, was present merely, and, if it should happily be escaped, would be succeeded by a state of ordinary security and those in which the danger, though present, was Only the commencement of a long course of danger, which might last with more or less interruption and remission, and possibly with great occasional increase, for a period, as was well stated in the present instance, of which the youngest of us might not live to see the conclusion. In the latter of these cases, it was idle to say, that we could confine975our thoughts merely to the consideration of the danger of the moment. We could not do so, without an abandonment of all the principles of right reason, and of civil prudence, both public and private. It might be admitted, if any one pleased, that the character of the present danger was such us to allow of no comparison with any consideration of a different sort; that no thought of future prosperity or greatness, of riches, of commerce, or any other object of national interest, could be opposed to that first and paramount consideration, the salvation and actual existence of the state. But the comparison which he was contending for, and which the present case required, was not of Safety against interest, life against money, &c.; &c;,&#x2014;quantities between which there might be no comparison or proportion, but of safety against safety, danger against danger, the danger of the present moment against that of the next and every one that was to succeed it. There was the same fallacy in the reasonings which he was adverting to, as occurred often in discussions upon the treaty of Amiens; and other occasions of that sort, where the question used to be described as a question between war and peace. The answer was, that it was not a question between war and peace, but, as we now experienced to our cost, between war and war&#x2014;war such as it was at that time, and war such as we now find it to be, when we are shut up as prisoners in our own island, and are lighting, not to conquer the enemy, but to preserve ourselves from destruction. We must inevitably, therefore, and whether we would or no, take into our consideration the interests of future moments, as well as of the present, and not be guilty of the folly of trying to save ourselves from the present danger, by means that must ensure our perishing under the selfsame danger the moment after. The only possible case in which we could justify the disregard of all precautions for our future safety, would be, the certainty that the present danger must overwhelm us. If he were sure that he must perish to-day, he might safely neglect all provision for to-morrow: but if he were not sure of perishing to-day, and. that the danger was of that sort which, even if averted for the moment, would not thereby cease and pass away, he must, upon every principle of reason, in considering the means necessary for his present safety, have a view976to the dangers which were immediately to succeed.&#x2014;Under this conviction, therefore, and upon these principles, the House must come to the consideration of that third proposition which he had adverted to, and on which the present bill was founded; namely, that the improvement of the volunteer System, supposing it to be the best for present defence, was for that reason, and without further inquiry, to be adopted. Two questions were for this purpose equally important. Was the improvement of the volunteer system, the measure most efficacious for present defence? And admitting it even to be so, was it the measure (taking in, agreeably to what he had just been contending for, both present and future dangers) which would most conduce to our safety upon the whole, and for that reason be to be adopted, whatever objections might be urged against it in other respects? To these a third might be added, which he would not stop to argue at length: was it certain, that by the measures now proposed, the force of the volunteers would, in reality, receive any addition? The question must not be wholly passed by, nor dismissed, without a word or two of observation. Though it might be admitted, that greater allowances in money, by enabling the volunteers oftener to assemble, would considerably assist their training, that the aid of officers and non-commissioned officers from the regulars would contribute to the same end; and advantage possibly be derived from the regulations for securing attendance in the first instance, and afterwards for enforcing orderly behaviour among those who should be made to attend, yet it must be remembered, that these benefits would not be obtained without a certain abatement, and that a part of the provisions in question, while they might improve the discipline, were likely to thin the numbers of the corps. This was a circumstance, which even the approvers of the present system must consider as a drawback: but by those who disapproved of that system, who. have always considered it as mistaken and vicious, and as turning the zeal and energy of the country into a wrong channel, a further objection must be found, in whatever tended (and was designed) to confirm that system, and to continue the volunteers in a course which they ought never to have taken. Much doubt might, therefore, be felt, whether the volunteer force would,977in reality, be increased by the provisions of this bill: in other words, whether what Was represented as an improvement, was in truth an improvement or not? But admitting this to be the fact, there still came the two great and leading inquiries; 1st, how far the improvement of the volunteers was the best course to be pursued, with a view even to present danger, considering, that even for the moment this improvement would not be obtained, but by means prejudicial in other respects? And idly, how far what might be best for the moment, would be best upon the long run, and might not more than counterbalance what was gained in present safety, by the injury done to all our means of safety in future? It was singular enough, that in all this discussion about the improvement of the volunteers, no one should have remarked, that the main clause of the bill, that which was by far the most efficient and operative, namely, that which gave the exemptions, was one, in which improvement was not at all concerned. A man was not a bit the Letter volunteer, was not in the smallest degree improved, either in his marching, or in the use of his musquet, in consequence of being exempted from the militia or army of reserve. The whole effect of this clause was not to improve, but to continue the volunteers; and in the question, therefore, of improvement, must be wholly laid out of consideration, though, is other views, it was the most important and powerful clause of all. It was of consequence that the Mouse should keep distinctly in its view, that there were two descriptions of clauses in the bill: those, namely, which were meant for the improvement of the volunteer body, and those which were directed only to preserve and keep it together. The former might be called theimprovingand the latter thepreservativeclauses. The latter had nothing to do with improvement, and could be considered as no addition to the bill in that respect: but the former had, on the contrary, something to do with the maintenance and preservation of the body, and, in fact, would be found to operate very forcibly against it. The powers given to the commanders of corps, the regulations for enforcing obedience, the additional days of attendance, all these would in themselves, and still more by the sort of confused apprehension which they would excite, operate, probably, in driving considerable numbers from the volunteer ser-978vice, and in counteracting the effect intended to be produced by the grant of exemptions. And so far hon. gent, might say, that he (Mr. W.) must approve of their operation, inasmuch as it would defeat in part the effect of a clause which he was not inclined to approve. But in fact, when the matter came to be considered, it would be found that they would not be attended with even this advantage. Though they might thin the volunteers, they would not reduce the grievance complained of, which was, the injury done by the volunteer system to other services. The objection to the grant of exemptions was, not that it gave men to the volunteers, but that it withdrew them from services which were more important; and this evil would not be diminished, unless, contrary to what was likely to be the fact, the men whom these new regulations might cause to resign, were persons who had no exemptions but those which their volunteer service gave them. The reverse was rather to be expected, viz. that those persons would first give way, who had no need, for protection, of service in the volunteers, but had protections of another sort, either from age or number of children, or from their being already serving by substitute is some other species or force. These persons might go, while the others remained; so that with less numbers in the volunteers, the number withdrawn from other services might continue just the same; and thus, all the evils consequent upon the present bill will be incurred, while the volunteer force, that force to which every thing was sacrificed, would really be less in numbers, and probably weaker altogether, than if none of these mischievous provisions had been introduced.&#x2014;Here, therefore, if the facts were as he supposed, would be a good answer to one of the questions which he had adverted to, namely, whether even present security was well provided for by the measures now proposed? It was not very intelligible, how an immediate danger was to be provided against by a gradual improvement; how they were to guard against the dangers of the next three weeks, or next three months, by such a change as could be effected in the volunteers by the operation of the bill during that time. But when to this was to be added, the reduction of numbers which-the bill might occasion,&#x2014;a reduction not unlikely to operate faster in diminishing979the volunteer force, (meaning here by that expression, not the numbers, but the real effective result of the system,) than the improved discipline: would in increasing it; and (far more than all this) when they were to take into consideration the effects of this system, not future and distant, but instant and immediate. Upon all the other and better species of force, it did not seem too much to say, that from the present moment, as well as at all future ones, the country would be weaker in its general defence, in consequence of this bill, and of others which had preceded it, than if no such bills had ever been passed.&#x2014;The greater part of the evils here complained of, which would begin to operate from the present moment, which would continue their operation through all succeeding ones, would be derivable partly front the condition respecting exemptions, which the present bill confirmed, and partly from what was now professed, and what might at all times have been expected, of the course likely to be pursued by the executive government. It was easy to foresee, and it had in fact been foreseen, that those who wished to make the volunteers permanent, and to give them their present shape and character, would adopt a course of proceeding with them, similar to that which had in part been declared.&#x2014;The first circumstance that presented itself upon this occasion was, the odd idea of making the volunteer system permanent. It was very near a contradiction in terms. Zeal was, in its nature, a very transitory feeling; and accordingly the hon. gents, when they meant, to prolong a system derived originally from that source, very prudently had recourse to motives more constant in their operation, and less likely to fail, than a mere effusion of zeal and patriotism excited by an opinion of present danger. The permanence of the system was to be entrusted to the good old steady principles of interest and fear, excited by bounties and advantages on the one hand, and penalties on the other. It was whimsical, indeed, to hear those who had vaunted so loudly the disinterestedness of these corps, who had branded as enemies to the volunteers every one who had hinted even a suspicion, that a view to exemptions could have had any influence upon their offers, now stating, that nothing but the hope of exemptions could hold them together, and that they would all fall to pieces the moment this principle980of coherence was withdrawn. Let it be remembered always, that this was the language of their friends. He had never said more, than that the prospect of exemptions had been a motive with many; as with many; it certainly had not. He could himself vindicate from any share in that, motive, those with whom he had been more immediately connected, as they had been expressly told, that exemptions were what they were by no means to count upon. Testimonies to the same effect had been heard from every part of the House; and the fact was, indeed, notorious, that a great part of the volunteers, probably much the greater, had offered their services, either not thinking about exemptions, or being distinctly told that they were not to have them* It was curious, therefore, to hear it now stated, and by those who made themselves the peculiar guardians of the character of the volunteers, that exemptions, and exemptions only, would induce them to continue their services. He was inclined to doubt this statement, at least to the extent to which it was urged. It could hardly apply to those who had never had exemptions in view, and who, by possessing them hitherto, had enjoyed abonuswhich they had not originally looked to: and if there were others, who, having been influenced by that motive, which he was far from meaning to blame them for, though it would take from their offer any claim to merit, might be disposed to withdraw, when their purpose in that respect was no longer answered, their number might not be greater than that of persons who would be led to quit the corps from the causes which he had before adverted to. Whatever the effect might be, it was plain that the purpose of these regulations was to continue the volunteer system at all events; not limiting its continuance by the motives which gave it birth, and which might be supposed commensurate with the causes that made it desirable; nor suffering it, whenever the time should come, to die a natural death, but giving to it a kind of forced existence, by means of motives which must equally operate* whether a force of that description was desirable or not.&#x2014;This was the purpose; and therefore, in estimating the merits, of this measure, they were to consider, not merely what its present effects would be, but what its operation at more distant periods. And in this view they must not overlook one981great head of danger, on which he had rarely dwelt, but to which he must not, on that account, be considered as insensible; namely, that which must arise from the existence of great bodies of armed men not subject to military law. Upon this point possibly, though upon this only, his opinions might vary, in some small degree, from those of an hon. gent, (his hon. friend as, he, was sure, he would allow him to call him, and as he well might call him on subjects on which they so generally agreed, having commonly found it so difficult to forbear calling him so on subjects on which they completely differed), who, from the general turn and cast of his mind, might be less alive to eventual dangers of the sort which he was alluding to. He would so far agree with his hon. friend, as to admit that there was no danger of that sort at present. He was as much persuaded as any man, that whatever disaffection there was in the country (and they must never flatter themselves that it would be wholly extinct), was, for the present, confined within very narrow limits, and in a great measure absorbed arid lost in the general care of providing against a danger which would make no distinction of friend or foe, but involve all in one common ruin. Of this disaffection, a less portion would necessarily be found among the volunteers, than among any other equal collection of people. Where there was so much zeal and loyalty, and patriotism, there could be little room for feelings of an opposite sort. But they must not suppose that this would be always so; there was in this institution, \"nature, that in time would venom breed,\" though there might be \"no teeth for the present.\" Evidences of this were perhaps already to be discerned. The volunteers, even in their present infant state, just new from the egg, had already shewn their strength, in obtaining a complete mastery over his Majesty's ministers. It was not the infant Hercules that was strangling the full-grown serpent, but the infant serpent that was subduing the full-grown strength of this Herculean ministry. His Majesty's ministers did not venture to stir a step upon this subject, without a previous consent obtained from the volunteers.&#x2014;He could not but strongly-reprobate the outcry which had been raised, and principally by the gent, of the Treasury bench, against all those who had freely delivered their opinions in condem-982nation of the volunteer system. Such an outcry, he had no hesitation in saying, was disgraceful to any man who contributed to raise it, and would be equally disgraceful to any man who suffered his conduct to be influenced by it; but it was evidently one of the characteristics of the present administration, that they had too much a view to that popular favour, which, unless under certain modifications and restrictions, should not operate upon the proceedings of government. They fancied, perhaps, that if they could succeed in exciting popular clamour against a member, they should restrain him from declaring opinions hostile to their measures; but they were excessively mistaken if they supposed, because that fear had so much effect upon themselves, that therefore it would have an equal effect upon the minds and conduct of others. He was told by a right hon. gent. (Mr. Hiley Addington) on a former night, that he was detested by the volunteers; he also heard it said, that it was dangerous for certain gentlemen to walk the streets, for the same reason. This might be intended as a joke rather than a serious warning; but it was a dangerous joke, and did not acquire much facetiousness from the manner of the persons who uttered it.&#x2014;He would not now dwell upon other instances of misconduct in the volunteers, particularly a memorable one, to which he had formerly adverted, namely, the riot at Chester. However little he might be disposed to call for any thing like vindictive vengeance in that case, or to look upon cases of that sort in general,As if the nation ne'er could thrive,Till every rioter were burnt alive,yet he must say, that it was a marked and shocking instance of that sort of subjection in which the government was to the volunteer body, and of subjection manifested in the way least to be endured, viz. by art unequal and partial distribution of criminal justice.&#x2014;An immense objection, there-there, was on this score to be urged against any measure of which the tendency and object was to perpetuate the volunteer system; not to mention, at present, those other numerous objections which he had often had occasion to advert to; viz. the disturbance given, and the confusion introduced into all the relations and functions of civil life, and the fatal effect of weakening, and absolutely reducing to I nothing, those distinctions which had hi-983therto been appropriate to military men, and which, with the sentiments belonging to such men, they had hitherto been willing to accept in lieu of more solid advantages.&#x2014;But he would confine himself at present to what related merely to defence: and to say upon this head, that the volunteer system, with the exemptions granted to them, had no effect upon the supply of the other services, was something so extravagant, that he could not understand how it could be seriously asserted. The exemptions, as was evident, operated in no less than four ways.&#x2014;They, 1st, us was notorious, exhausted, in many instances, the very population of the parish or district from which the supply was to come. They, 2dly, by being conferred principally on the young unmarried men, who were the first to enter into the volunteer corps, threw the ballot in a greater proportion on those who, when drawn, were the least likely to serve in person, and who, in consequence, in proportion to their numbers, would require a greater number of substitutes. Thirdly, while they thus increased the demand, they, by protecting men from the danger of the ballot, lessened the number of those who might be willing to engage as substitutes; and, lastly, when they did not absolutely produce the effect of preventing men from so engaging, they put them at least in a situation in which they could bargain to much greater advantage, and were not likely to engage but from the temptation of higher terms. In every one of these ways the exemptions had a direct and necessary tendency to increase the rate of bounty, and of consequence to bring it to that state, in which it actually was, and in which recruiting for the army could no longer go on. If an instance were wanting, lie might take the army of reserve, which, in spite of all the whipping and spurring which had been applied, had come to what, in the language of sportsmen, was called a dead stand-still, at the distance of 14,000 men from its projected amount. There it was for the present, incapable of moving a step further. And though he would not pretend to say, that by the aid of a little nursing, with the help pf a feed of corn, it might not again creep forward, yet he would venture to predict, shat it would never reach the place of its destination, would never produce the number for which it was calculated.&#x2014;-Even in this view alone, speaking of the system as a, permanent984establishment, he could have no difficulty in saying, that the prejudice it would occasion, with respect merely to defence, was beyond comparison greater, than any advantages to be derived from it in the improved state of discipline and expert, ness in the volunteer corps. The great question, however, still remained; that which seemed in gentlemen's minds to put a stop to every other, viz. could the volunteer system, false and faulty as it might have been originally, be then abolished? Would not the suppression of exemptions instantly disband the corps? And could the country, in its present circumstances, afford to divest itself at once of such a vast portion of its force? Finally, could the suppression of exemptions be effected consistently with a perfect observance of good faith? He had little difficulty in saying that it could; provided always that no abridgment was made of the exemptions, which were granted for service already performed, or which was in a course of performing: and unquestionably no doubt could arise with respect to all who might enter into volunteer corps from that time forward. It was curious, indeed, to hear those talk with so much solicitude about preserving faith with the volunteers, who were at the moment taking such liberties with that faith, or rather committing so great a breach of it, in the very provisions which they were then proposing; there being nothing so clear, as that upon any. Principles of strict engagement, they had no right whatever to make those changes in the condition of volunteer service which was then proposed. If, then, good faith did not seem to stand in the way of the suppression pf exemptions at a proper time, with respect to those even who were already enrolled; as unquestionably it did not with respect to those who might enter in future; there were, on the. other hand, the strongest reasons for wishing to get rid of exemptions, not merely as injurious to the public interests, but as inconsistent with a principle not less to be regarded than good faith itself; namely, justice. Nothing could he more flagrantly unjust, nor more cruelly oppressive, than the power now possessed by individuals, or by self-created bodies of individuals, of imposing or withholding at their pleasure, a fine, such as that which attached to the ballot of the army of reserve and of the militia. Let any one consider what that fine was, what its amount in itself, and what the effect985likely to be produced by it, in nine out of ten of the persons on whom it may fall, and then say, whether this was a power fit to be left to individuals or to committees, acting with respect to those whom they may protect from, or expose to this fine, with little other rule than their own mere discretion and option. The obligation upon the House to guard against the existence of such a power was greatly en-creased by considering the classes of persons, upon whom it would be found principally to operate. These were the lower orders of journeymen and labourers, especially those who were married, and who with families so circumstanced as to make the burthen either of serving in person, or of providing a substitute, more grievous and least possible for them to support, had yet not the specified number of children which would entitle them to an exemption. There could not be a class of people having more claim to the consideration and protection of the House, or whose rights and interests the House should be more jealous of appearing in any respect to abandon. Of all persons, those whose cause ought to be espoused with most zeal and anxiety, were the helpless and friendless; though these were, unhappily, the persons, who in the general confusion of human affairs, and with the general infirmity of human nature, which too often lead men to press upon the weak rather than to resist the strong, were the most likely to be neglected and overlooked. It was not always that in public affairs, the greatest injustice was that which was least easy to be committed, or would excite the loudest complaints. Complaint seemed to be among those effects, in the producing which, bodies are found to operate in proportion to their surfaces; whereas injustice was often greater the more it was confined and condensed, and the more partially it fell; so that it was commonly easier and safer to do a great injustice to a few, than a smaller one to many. The House, therefore, would, he hoped, be particularly anxious not to leave such a power, could it possibly be avoided, as that which enabled persons, not only to withdraw themselves from a burthen which ought to be common to all, but, what was far worse, to throw the burthen from their play shoulders upon those of others, and thus to double and treble and quintuple the load upon those who were least able to support even their own original share. Against any supposed986hardship of withdrawing the exemptions from the volunteers, he hoped the House would not fail to set in opposition, the extreme injustice, towards the classes, which he had mentioned, of continuing them.&#x2014;Thus far as to the question of good faith, which might be supposed to stand as a plea in bar against any alteration to be made in the volunteer system, as applicable to those who were already engaged in it. Upon the effect which the withdrawing exemptions would have in dissolving the corps, he had already spoken, and would not do more, therefore, than repeat his opinion, that the reduction thus occasioned would very possibly not be greater, and would certainly be far less disadvantageous, than that which would be effected by the joint operation of the liberty of resignation, and the various vexatious regulations now introduced.&#x2014;But upon the whole of this question of the reduction or disbanding of the Volunteers, he wished to make one observation; namely, that to disband corps of volunteers was a very different operation, and would have a very different effect, from that of disbanding a part of a regular army. An army disbanded, is dispersed in away not to be reassembled: but not so a corps of volunteers; which, though nominally dissolved, left all the parts precisely in the same situation in which they were. Not a man would be found removed from the spot on which he had all along been residing; nor would either his powers or his disposition be changed in any degree, at least in any material degree, from what, they were when he belonged to the corps. Supposing, therefore, that the whole volunteer system were completely dissolved to-morrow; though a change would be made, no doubt, yet a change not at all of the sort which many were hastily led to suppose. Though there would be much less correspondence in the right hon. gent's office, fewer orders and counter-orders, less annoyance, less disturbance, fewer disputes, less of the present evils, great and small, of the system, and though much would; no doubt be lost of the progressive improvement in the common practice and; training, yet the men would all remain, there would be the same bodies, the same limbs, and the same hearts, and, upon any alarm, the same disposition to run together again, either as some have supposed of the atoms at the last day into precisely the same shapes, or into new combinations987possibly not less advantageous. The House must not run away, therefore, with a, notion, that to dissolve the volunteers, was utterly to deprive the country of all the benefit of that force in the same manner or to the same degree, as would happen in the reduction of any other military body. And this consideration would apply to that other head of inquiry; viz. the prudence or possibility of making any material change, with a danger impending such as that by which we wore now threatened. It was said, our system may have been ill-conceived, our means ill-chosen, the posture into which we have thrown ourselves not the best calculated to give us the benefit of our strength: but what can now be done? To attempt to change our course of proceedings Be, would be as dangerous as a general's attempting to change his positions at the moment when he was expecting an attack.&#x2014;This argument he heard, he confessed, with great distrust, because it never failed to be urged from the beginning, and at periods when it was evident now that it was not true. It was the argument which had been in constant use to cover every thing that was wrong, and to make it impossible that an error once begun, should ever be set right. We had been forever in the state of a horse, who having got into a false gallop, was so pressed on by the injudiciousness of his rider, that he had never time to change and to get right again. We were acting upon the instruction sometimes ludicrously given to a foot messenger, \"to make such haste, that if he should tumble down, he must not stay to get up again.\" But, in opposition to such maxims, he must say, that on this, as on almost every other occasion, there must be a comparison of evils, and that it was not sufficient to say, there will be great mischief or danger in doing this or that, without taking into consideration what would be the evil or danger of not so doing. He would accept the comparison of a general who had got into a bad position, arid was threatened with an attack, and admit the danger in such circumstances, of his attempting to make his position better; yet if lie knew that he must be attacked in that position, and that, if attacked, he must to a certainty be beat, it might be necessary for him to attempt the change, with whatever danger it might be attended. A ship, in like manner, going before the wind, might be so pressed by the gale, that, to tack would988hazard instant destruction; yet if destruction were inevitable by continuing her course, if there were a shore a-head that admitted of no escape, the attempt to tack must be made, whatever consequences might be apprehended. Such he felt to be the situation of this country. To continue the present system, with all the consequences which it was obvious would grow out of, was little else than ruin. One of the consequences which it was plain was intended, was that of bringing the volunteers to meet the enemy in regular battle. It was a mistake exactly similar to this, which lost the country to William the Conqueror, at the battle of Hastings; a place that ought to be a warning to those who would now-put their trust in so fallacious an idea. The case of La Vendee did not apply here. The Vend&#x00E9;ans gave up their country to be ravaged, and their villages to be burned; not as part of their system, but because they could not help it: when they had done so, they attempted a course, of which he feared, we could not avail ourselves, in case of any disaster under-the present system. He certainly allowed it was the best way to meet the enemy at once, and beat him. But this was like the receipt for running a race, to take the lead and keep it. The Vend&#x00E9;ans had never once assembled to fight as a regular army, except on one memorable occasion, when they met to march to Granville, to the number of 40, 50, or as some said, 80 thousand men, for the purpose of receiving the supplies of arms which they expected us to have brought them. It was on this occasion that the French armies took advantage to crush them, in such a manner as they never recovered, though they long sustained themselves with a noble energy. It was once considered whether they should again meet their enemies in regular battle; but it was considered by all their generals, that they would have much disadvantage in a regular conflict with troops so far superior to them in arms and discipline. They had again recourse to that warfare in which the enemy could not reach them, in which they were in the situation described by Macbeth,As easy may'st thou the. intrenchant airWith thy keen sword impress, as make me bleed.By that system they still eluded the force of a power which subdued all Europe, and which did not subdue them till it had subdued all Europe, He considered the989sort of discipline the volunteers would obtain a disadvantage. It brought to his recollection what pope said of Curl's cir-cumeision&#x2014;the ceremony was interrupted, and he was left half circumcised, which, according to the Jewish law, was worse than not being circumcised at all. Whether this was good rabbinical doctrine or Dot, he did not know; but it was perfectly conformable to the common notions and language of mankind.A little learning is a dangerous thing,had been observed the other night.&#x2014;\"aut nunquam tentes avt perfice,\"was a maxim to the same effect. The system, in his opinion, ought to be entirely changed. The French National guards, so often cited as a justification for regarding the volunteers as regular troops, were, employed at times in garrison towns, in escorting convoys, or perhaps murdering prisoners in cold blood; but they were not placed in the front of the battle, nor were ever employed against the enemy at all. These were the troops, however, to which alone, in their mode of formation and: training, our volunteers bore any resemblance. Whereas theVolunteersof France, whom we, judging by the name, chose to conclude at once to be the troops corresponding to ours, were troops raised upon a quite different fooling, who were instantly marched away from home the moment they were raised, and were never employed as troops against an enemy till they had been trained for at least eighteen months in every other species of military duty. This was particularly the case at Jemappe, where the battle was fought in November 1792, and the volunteers that fought there were those raised in the beginning of 1790&#x2014;The bill, in his opinion, might be considered as a new mutiny bill, printed on fine white satin. He ridiculed the measure in toto, and described it as having been formed in a smithery near Westminster-Hall, where every one was at work at it, and amongst the rest, the Attorney-General, hammering away and fetching it up with John Doe and Richard Roe assisting him. He was fully satisfied, that out of barren moor like this, not one good crop could be got, and he was the more convinced of the folly of resorting to it, when such a rich and abundant field presented itself as the army. The right hon. gent, concluded with expressing his decided opposition to the whole of the system.", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-windham-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1804", "mar", "22"], "content": "said, that he should have supposed, from the speech of the right hon. gent, that he was not in the House when his right hon. friend spoke, for he had completely misrepresented all his arguments. He had never stated that all the volunteers had exemptions nor had he997ever stated that the volunteers had enrolled themselves merely on account of the exemptions. On the contrary, he had mentioned several corps within his own knowledge that were enrolled before the exemptions were granted. It, was there, fore very hard to have arguments and sentiments attributed to gent, which they had never uttered. He and his right hon. friend had always argued, that the exemptions had not induced men to enter into volunteer corps, and therefore they had always opposed the granting of exemptions; and this was an answer to at least three-fourths of the right hon. gent, speech. The right hon. gent, had stated; that the national guard composed a part of Dumourier's army: of this fact he was not quite sure, but he knew that it was composed at first of raw troops, and the first report he sent of them was, that 20,000 of them ran away from 1500 Austrians. It should also be recollected, that one of the first exploits of these raw French troops was to murder their own General (Dillon); and the next was, to make another of their generals (Biron), a prisoner. It was true, that these men turned out to be good troops after a campaign or two; but he only mentioned these cases, to shew the reliance that was to be placed upon raw troops. The only way of judging upon cases of this kind was to look into history, and he did not recollect a single instance in which raw troops had, in the first instance, been successfully opposed to veterans. The right hon. gent, had contended, that it was not the intention of government to substitute the volunteers for an armed peasantry, because the King had the power of calling out the population of the country: but had they taken the means to call them out? had they provided arms for them? or if they hourly expected the invasion, why when; they not called out? It had been asserted that the volunteers had attained a greater degree of perfection than could have been expected; but he believed that wear three-fourths of them had never fired with ball cartridge, and yet these men were raised to repel an attack that was expected in August last. The right hon. gent, had relied much upon the reports of some general officers, particularly Lord Cathcart, General Simcoe, and Lord Moira. With regard to Lord Cathcart, he believed he only spoke of the Irish volunteers, which were certainly, in some998respects, different from those of this country. With regard to the report of General Simcoe, no man could be disposed to pay greater respect to it than he was; but he should like to know what number of general officers had made similar reports: if there were no others, why then it might be inferred that was the only corps in such an advanced state of discipline. As to the opinion which had been said to be advanced by Lord Moira, it was one which he believed had been delivered at a public dinner; whether it had been correctly reported or not, he did not know, and therefore it was impossible to know whether his Lordship had really advanced such an opinion or not. It had been argued, that the volunteer system had not injured the recruiting for the army; but to this assertion he could not give credit: it was universally known, that the army had not been recruited as it might have been, and indeed it was impossible but that the number of exemptions given must materially affect the recruiting for the army; but it was contended that Parliament would be guilty of a breach of faith, if the volunteers were deprived of their exemptions: but was it not a breach of faith with the volunteers, when the number of days which they were obliged to drill, in order to obtain those exemptions, were changed from 20 to 44. The right hon. gent, had placed great reliance upon a comparison of the force in G. Britain now, and in the former war: but was the danger the same? was the whole force of France directed against this country? If it was not, it was absurd to revert to precedents in former wars. He still retained the opinion he had expressed of the advantage that would result from an armed peasantry, because, instead of 400,000 men, you would then have two millions; but now, with the exception of the army, the militia, and the volunteers, there was not a man armed in the country. Before he sat down, he wished to ask ministers, whether they really expected the invasion, or they did not? If they did, he believed there never was an instance of a country left in such a state of defence, when such a powerful invasion was expected: if they did, he thought they ought immediately to set about some measures for its future security.", "author_id": "/people/mr-charles-fox-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

He regretted that his idea had not been adopted, but the country was to make the best they could of the system as it stood. He would not agree with an hon. Colonel near him, as to the degree of discipline that was necessary in the volunteer corps. It had been pleasantly quoted, thatA little learning is a dangerous thing,That certainly he could have no objection to, as a line from Pope; but the, maxim was neither very convenient nor very practicable in the occurrences of private life. There were many avocations, in which he would rather employ persons who knew something of their trade, than those who were utterly unacquainted with the first principles of it. It was no easy matter to define what military discipline was; but if it consisted, according to his ideas, in knowing the use of a musquet, in being able to march with steadiness and precision, and in certain habits of obedience and regularity, inseparable from a military life, that degree of discipline he thought the volunteers capable of; and he was happy to find that, to a certain extent, they had attained it. Even that portion of discipline that could be acquired by a few persons assembling in a room, and learning at the, word of command eyes right, and eyes left, would be attended with no little advantage; and if it should be ever found necessary to habituate the volunteers to a looser manner of spreading themselves over, or getting through a country, they would not have much difficulty in adopting that mode of discipline. He fully agreed with the hon. Colonel, as to the extreme importance of the city of London; and he thought that1000the volunteer force could render most service to the country, not by meeting the enemy on their first disembarkation, but by combating them in a desultory manner between the capital and the coast. He was not so sanguine in his expectations from the exertions of the two millions of armed peasantry. It was a fact well known to every military man, that in a battle only a certain number of troops could be employed; and if 50 or 60,000 French should effect a landing, even 100,000 volunteers, or armed peasantry, would be as useless as two millions.", "author_id": "/people/sir-william-pulteney", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

This he applied to the idea of employing the volunteers singly; if such were to be acted upon, experience would soon shew its injurious effects. He next adverted to the important consideration of driving the cattle from those parts of the coasts where an enemy was likely to effect a landing. He recollected, when serving under the present Lord Howe, in America, that the enemy uniformly took the precaution of1002driving the cattle from such parts of the coast as his debarkations were made; this operation threw his Majesty's forces into a distressing dilemma, and they were always forced to recur to their own magazines: the consequence was, that with all the skill and ability of that celebrated officer, he was unable to penetrate further than thirty or forty miles up the country.

A great deal of the statements which had been made on the contrary, were founded on the numbers who were drawn from the army of reserve, who were induced by a superadded and excessive premium to enter into the general service, and these they called recruits. There was a clause, he observed, in theArmy of Reserve Act, allowing men of the height of five feet two, to enter as substitutes; the consequence of which was, that on a certain occasion, where upwards of 1000 men had entered from the Army of Reserve, owing to the five-feet-two clause, there could not be found one man of five feet four for the general defence of the country.

{"date": ["1804", "mar", "28"], "content": "felt it a painful task to oppose a motion like the present, where personal feelings were interested, and especially the feelings of persons who had so signally deserved of their country. There was a distinction to be taken in the present question, it was intended to decide on the interest, not on the honour of the persons concerned. But to make it plain and distinct, it was only necessary to determine it was a. question of right; or to examine whether it came before the House as a case of liberality? Perhaps the right hon. gent, intended to make it assume both aspects. For his arguments appealed at one time to the liberality, at another to the justice of the House. It was true, indeed, that in such cases, it seldom happened that the liberality of the House was appealed to in vain.&#x2014;If, however, the House was to decide according to strict justice, the question before them would simply be, whether the capture, or the possession rather, of the ships at Toulon, was prize or no prize? This might be collected from attention to the circumstances under which they came into our power; but he was not willing to enter into a detail of the particulars which accompanied the transaction. It was enough to state, that the ships came into our possession in consequence of a convention. Then we1066did not take possession of them by capture, but by virtue of a treaty. When the condition on which they came into our possession could not be fulfilled, the power to dispose of them then devolved on his Majesty, not on those who merely took possession of them. The only case which the right hon. gent, thought strictly in point with the present, was that of the capture at the Helder. But between these two cases, in his mind, there was no just analogy. In the Helder case we took forcible possession of the ships: they attempted to remove from our attack, but we followed them, and stood close in with them in array of battle. In corroboration of this assertion, the hon. gent, read to the House several passages of the Dutch Admiral's answer to the summons of our Admiral calling on him to hoist the Orange flag. They confessed themselves to be, and were in reality, made prisoners of war. Where then was the analogy between the two cases? at Toulon the whole business was done by a convention. The right hon. gent, says, the ships were libelled in the Court of Admiralty: if so, the question may be simply decided on that point. Let it be determined under the prize act whose property they are, and if they are declared to be that of Lord Hood, he should not hesitate a moment in acceding to the motion. The prizes at the Helder were adjudged by a legal decision. But was 236,0001. a trifling sum under the present impaired and labouring state of our finances; or if such a sum is thus to be voted away in the present situation of the country, are not the land forces, who co-operated with the fleet in that service, entitled to their share of the reward? It was unfair to acknowledge the right of the one, without attending to the claims of the other.&#x2014;But if the right existed, no one would more cheerfully concur in the vote than himself. But let it be submitted to the decision of the learned gent, opposite him (Sir Wm. Scott); it was for him to declare whether they were prize or not, and by that proper decision he should abide; if there was no right, why vote away a sum of so large an amount. It was incompatible with that system of economy which the right hon. gent, seemed anxious to pursue, and for which he gave him the greater credit, as a contrary lesson had been taught him by his predecessor. But again, he had only to repeat, let the question be tried1067before the proper tribunal; let the ships be declared prize or no prize, and then the question might easily be decided.", "author_id": "/people/mr-george-johnstone", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1804", "mar", "28"], "content": "&#x2014;Sir; the question before the Committee, on which I did not expect any difference of opinion, is so intimately connected with the profession to which I have the honour of belonging, that I cannot resist offering a few remarks on the subject, especially us neither the right hon. the Chancellor of the Exchequer, or the hon. gent, who spoke last have fairly and correctly stated the case with respect to this point; whether the French fleet was delivered over to the noble and gallant Admiral, or whether it was taken possession of by a military operation. That the operation might have been combined I have no doubt, and that intercourse might have been had with some of the factious in Toulon is also very probable, but the predominant feature was certainly military. On the 23d of August Lord Hood appeared off Toulon with 14 sail of the line, where he found Admiral St. Julien (a creature of the Republic) in command of the French fleet of seventeen sail of the line, and who had suspended Admiral Trogoffe from all his functions and command, and consequently all the expected co-operation on the part of Trogoffe was at an end, and the gallant admiral decided to attack the French fleet in the formidable position in which it was moored; and like a great general (having long established his character as a great admiral) he disembarked the part of the army serving in his fleet with the marines, and took possession of Fort La Malgue. After this was achieved, did he not send a flag of truce to St. Julien, the French admiral, and make a disposition to attack his fleet at anchor from the catteries of La Malgue and the co-operation of the British fleet? These preparations, and the name of the noble admiral, and the recollection of the victories that composed its glory, had the greatest effect on St. Julien; the British admiral's conduct at Basse Terre, where he man&#x0153;uvred the French admiral De Grasse from his Anchorage, and took possession of it, was fresh in St. Julien's memory, he knew he had to contend with a man who had been in the habits of turning his countrymen out of their roadsteads, and taking possession of them and that the same military talent might be applied here. Shall we, says St. Julien to his partizans, give another opportunity of adding new laurels to1068the English flag, and increasing the disgrace of France. No! Let us retire, let us join the army of Carteaux, rather than risk the issue of a battle. These were the. motives which induced St. Julien to desert his fleet, accompanied with the crews of seven ships most attached to him, at the very moment the British admiral was about to enter to attack him. Can this then be called a convention? No! there was no condition, no convention between the contending commanders. And even in this, as well as after Lord Hood entered Toulon, he was seen to act not only as a gallant naval officer, but also as a great general, and consummate statesman; and then whether the fleet surrendered, or was taken in trust for Louis XVI. the operation to all intents and purposes must be considered as a military operation, and is entitled to the highest praise. It was difficult to say upon what ground a claim so well founded, could be objected. If the idea is to go abroad that the liberality of the House will not show itself to signal services at the recommendation of his Majesty, what discouraging effects may it not produce? Even at this moment, when Lord Nelson is blockading that same port of Toulon; when perhaps he is on the eve of capturing the French Fleet either by valour or negociation, is it to be held out that for such services as these there is to be no reward, because they may be said to be achieved by a convention. I contend that Lord Hood's conduct throughout the whole of this business, evinced the highest sense of honour, and the most refined delicacy.&#x2014;The question, in my opinion, is of the first importance, and recommend it: of the serious consideration of the House, and warn them how they permit either sophistry, or a mere quibble of the law to frustrate the claims of acknowledged merits to the strongest proofs of their liberality.

{"date": ["1804", "mar", "28"], "content": "&#x2014;Sir; as there will be a considerable interval between the present period, and the final discussion of the subject now before the House, I shall not be under the necessity of detaining the Mouse so long as I otherwise should, perhaps, feel it my ditty to do; but it is necessary for me to observe, that although the right hon. gent, has gone into the whole measure at once, on a general statement of the matter which he is hereafter to propose, which may therefore be hereafter discussed; yet those who feel like myself, must be anxious not to appear to assent to all he states, and therefore I shall say 41 few words on the subject of the message from his Majesty, and the address proposed by the right hon. gent. There cannot be the least hesitation to assent to the first, and, indeed, what may be called the formal part of the address to his Majesty, which returns thanks to his Majesty for his gracious communication; as little objection can there be made to the acknowledgment of the zeal of the militia of Ireland, or of the people of that country in the common cause; but it remains for me and for those who think with me to say, that we are not prepared to adopt measures to carry into execution any particular plan, until we have had an opportunity of considering what that plan is. The first and leading objection I have to accepting the present offer of the Irish militia is, an objection to the principle of the thing, that is, because by it. a body of men assembled for efficient military purposes, are to go beyond the terms of their original service. I do not say that no condition of things can do away this objection, because there may be a condition things which will do away all objections1086of whatever kind; but I say, that condition of things does not exist at this moment: and an objection it always will remain, let the condition of things be what it may; and the only question is, whether such a condition exists as to overrule that objection. I am of opinion, that in the present case, that condition has no such force at the present moment. I felt this objection strongly at the time the English militia made their offer to go to Ireland; and however useful, and perhaps decisive, that measure was upon the occasion to which it was applied, certainly that measure was not carried into effect without producing the inconveniences which I have alluded to, and which I took the liberty of stating at that time. I am confirmed, instead of being shaken, in the opinion I then entertained upon that subject; for, indeed, the taking such a service as this, although offered, is nothing more than that which may, in some degree, be called a departure from good faith: it is not a breach of good faith, but it is a sort of misprision of good faith; for although the leading part of such a service as this may be voluntary, and the offer spontaneous, yet, as to the remainder, it may be absolutely compulsory. If a part of a large military body make the offer, how is the remainder to refuse it? You do not seem to know the possible, nor seem very clearly to see the probable, consequences of such measures as these, for there are many evils attending them: one of these evils, besides the point which partakes of the nature of a breach of faith, is this; it has a very dangerous effect upon military discipline, especially upon such a force as that of a militia force; and, to illustrate this, I should like to ask gent, who went to Ireland with our militia, what passed as they were going there with their regiments; whether they did not hear some things that were utterly subversive of discipline? I would ask, whether the acceptance of such a service is not a species of suspension of discipline? Tutting yourself into a situation to ask a favour of a military body of men (for a favour this is) cannot be said to be free from danger. It may be said, that this is only renewing what I formerly said: that may be true, and yet the observation may not have lost its force because it happens to have been an old one, and the object may be as good now as if it had never been before made; besides, I do1087not see that Ireland is less in danger than G. Britain. When you say you let loose a part of your disposeable force in this country, that is to say, that you have so far a power to employ as you please, the regular force which you could not otherwise detach, you must remember, that precisely to the same amount you must make fast your force in Ireland. I have by these measures pretty good testimony of the propriety of the opinions I have formerly given on these points. This asking favour where you ought only to command, this begging of them will have a bad effect; it will introduce among our military bodies a species of saturnalia which may be extremely dangerous; for which reasons, although I agree in the first part of the address, as I have stated already, yet I dissent from the latter part of it. I would really say no more for the present purpose, than that we should take the matter into our consideration, for I think we ought to reserve to ourselves the mode in which we shall proceed, at least until we have had some time to deliberate upon it, for we should not consider the question as a mere transfer of force from the one country to the other; but this question involves a consideration of increasing the militia force of Ireland, a force which is not raised, as in this country, by ballot; and this goes, like many other measures to which I and some others have been constantly objecting, to the prejudice of increasing the regular army, and in that view it is particularly objectionable to me. Many of the propositions of the right hon. gent, to-night I cannot oppose, without giving up a great number of opinions I have delivered on various former occasions in his House, and in which opinions I have been every day more and more convinced, as the subjects have been presented to my mind; Such as that of the propriety of putting an end to the competition of the services by which bounties have been increased; the taking the matter of recruiting entirely into the hands of govt., instead of leaving individuals to 'vie with each other, and creating an expense so enormous and so burthensome. These and some other points stated to-night by the right hon. gent, are what I have stated several times, and a great while ago in this House. These, it seems, are now to be adopted, though then it seemed they were not mature, and were therefore rejected. It1088seems as if reason to his Majesty's ministers was like fruit, not fit to eat in less than twelve mouths, for it is now that distance, of time since they were offered; but at last they have been thought fit for the table of the right hon. gent, and so they have been to-night accordingly served up. Upon one point I would ask for information, whether the new regiments are to be raised by recurring to the old and ruinous system of recruiting for rank, and if so, whether ministers can hope for any power of legislation in such a case that will prevent a competition which must be most injurious in its effects? As to the point of the duration of the service in the regular army, I do not blame the right hon. gent, for not alluding to it sooner, for he had no measure that had a bearing upon it sooner: upon that subject I retain the opinion I have often delivered in this House. In a word, I agree with the right hon. gent, as to the propriety of reducing the enormous bounties we have so long heard of, and they cannot be reduced without taking away the competition which has produced them. I agree with the right hon. gent, also in the propriety of govt. taking the whole of the recruiting system into its own hands. I agree too, that the first part of the address ought to be voted, namely, thanks to his Majesty for his gracious communication, and an acknowledgment of the zeal of the people of Ireland: but there I think the address ought to stop for the present. I am not, without much further consideration, prepared to say yes to the remainder of the address, which will tie down this House to every thing but the mere detail of a system, the principles of which I do not approve, and for the consideration of which this House has not had time enough, and, therefore, I shall move, by way of amendment to this address, to leave out all the latter part of it, for the purpose of inserting the words, \"and that we shall take the same into our most serious consideration,\"&#x2014;The question being put,", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-windham-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

In 1798, when the English militia volunteered their services to Ireland, there was a rebellion raging there, which left1091the House no alternative. In the present I instance, when boasting of our 400,000 volunteers, and our other military strength, he thought there was no great necessity for going to beg 10,000 men in Ireland. If any gent, were to ask, in what part of the empire 10,000 men were most wanting, he would be answered, in Ireland.&#x2014;Whence were these 10,000 men to be taken? From Ireland!

He insisted, that all the advantage derived from the army of re serve it supplying the regular army, was derived from the advice and opinions of his right hon. friend. He accused ministers of committing and recommitting, and altering again, and again their measures so often, that at last they did not know their own works, and afterwards taking to themselves the merit of every thing that was found in every legislative regulation, although almost every thing valuable of that sort, since the commencement of their administration, was the suggestion of some one or other who bad no connection with them, generally one of their direct opponents.

If he understood the nature of the case rightly, there was no necessity whatever for the hasty decision passed by his Majesty's ministers. He was informed by an officer of great respectability, that the Irish govt. had offers of service from some of the militia regiments so long since as 4 months: if this was the fact, the consideration of the subject surely would admit a suspension of half a dozen days, to allow parliament time to deliberate on the principle of so great importance as that involved in the address. He defended his right hon. friend, so he hoped he might call him, from the charge of inconsistency in the opinions delivered by him. The state of Ireland at the time alluded to should be considered. A rebellion raged in the heart of the country, and we could spare no other force to resist or to suppress it then, but our militia: he had some opportunities of knowing the state of the popular mind in Ireland, and he was not quite so sanguine as to the extinction of disaffection therein as some gent, seemed to be; and much still remained to be done, before that spirit was obliterated. There were other objections which he entertained to a hasty decision upon the subject. He recollected on a former occasion, the total want of discipline that prevailed, while the sentiments of the militia corps were ascertaining upon the point of extension of service; and he trusted, he should never again have occasion to go round canvassing his men on such a subject.", "author_id": "/people/mr-john-calcraft-2", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

With respect to an equal offer of service on the part of the English militia, he well knew the beneficial tendency of such a proceeding. He recollected their signal services to the empire at large while employed in Ireland. To their exertions the salvation of that country was owing. Were it not that the regiments of Lord Buckingham and the Duke of Rutland landed so opportunely as they did, that country would no longer have appertained to Britain. He hoped the English militia would voluntarily come forward and extend their services to Ireland. But reprobated the idea of this being done in the way of stipulation. Was the ardour of either militia clogged in such a way, it would be injurious to both countries, and an insult to one. He thought the militia of Ireland could render the greatest service to the empire at large, when employed out of Ireland, problematical as this may appear. He felt it to be the case. He felt how it must operate, when a father and two or three of his sons were, perhaps, fighting against the rest of his family.

Member, and at the same time begged leave to add a few observations to what had fallen from him on the occasion. he asked the hon. gent.'s pardon for reminding him that the bill of last year on the subject, was not rejected by the House, but withdrawn by its framers for that time, with a view to reconsider the propriety of bringing it forward at a future day, in a more perfect shape; and he must own, he thought it rather extraordinary those gent, after having coolly reconsidered the bill, could again think of offering it for the adoption of parliament; for he could consider it in no other view than as a measure calculated merely to favour a monopoly, and he therefore trusted the House never would consent to pass it into a law, as it was of a tendency not only extremely injurious to one of the most useful, industrious, and important classes of the community in the country, but of the utmost danger to the very existence of that fishery which it professed to improve. To his certain knowledge, a number of persons, who, as well as their grandfathers, and great grandfathers before them, had been deeply engaged in, and derived their livelihood from, this trade, had recently, under the apprehension, which he thought unfounded, namely, that this bill would pass into law, actually sold off the ships they occupied in the trade, and many had even forfeited contracts into which they had entered, and-risked all the penalties they incurred thereby. He was sorry that any class of the community should be induced to entertain apprehensions that the legislature would, in the wisdom of its deliberations, suffer any measure to pass into a law for the advantage of one set of men, so injurious to the interests of so numerous, useful, and industrious a class of individuals. Ha stood not there merely a representative for a particular borough, whose inhabitants would be materially injured by the bill, to oppose it; but as a representative of the community at large, and for the general good. The advantages derived to the navy from this valuable class of men, was a matter worthy of serious consideration: no less than three thousand apprentices were actually bringing up on board the ships employed in the trade, for the supply of fish for the port of London. The House must see how impossible it would be for those men individually to stand, up against the high, bounties that1051would be offered by a wealthy company, which must deprive them of their hands, and, at the same time, not increase the quantity of fish, but transfer the profits of the trade from the industrious individuals, In whom it was now vested, and thereby destroy competition, and leave the community at the mercy of a monopolizing company.", "author_id": "/people/mr-henry-addington", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

When so material an alteration was proposed in the existing laws, for the regulation of so important a branch of trade, some broad and palpable ground should, he thought, be laid down to shew the necessity; but in this case, no such ground had been shewn. No advantage was proved practicable, and yet the House was called on to adopt a bill for vesting a monopoly in a new company of men, which must, in the first instance, ruin every town upon the river Thames, and upon the coasts in the vicinage of the metropolis: hence he could not agree to the bill. Another objection to it was, that it went to enable the company it proposed to incorporate to employ any number of seamen they thought necessary, and to protect them from the impress service; he was no particular friend to the impress service, but he had no idea of giving to any particular body, but particularly a new monopolizing company, an exclusive protection, which no other branch of the British marine could be allowed to enjoy. Besides, he was well informed, that the evil stated in this bill, of an unfair price being demanded for fish at Billingsgate, did not exist. It was put up there fairly to auction to the highest bidder, and sold at the fairest price; and to take it now out of the hands of individuals, long experienced in the trade, and interested in a competition, and place it in the hands of the Marine Society, who knew nothing of the business, would he to destroy competition and sanction monopoly.", "author_id": "/people/mr-robert-hurst-3", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

The alledgment on this point, therefore, was merely assertion, and not fact. But did gent, consider, that if, as was said, 3000 apprentices were living on board the fishery ships, that the Marine-Society had sent upwards of 56,000 seamen to the navy? Surely, therefore, some consideration was due to their institution; and the present bill had for its object, not only to enable the Marine Society to extend the means of rearing seamen, but of lowering the price of an important article of provision to the public. Much had been said of the danger of creating a corporation, at the risk of a monopoly. He believed, however, that the public had already experienced much greater mischiefs from a combination, than could be apprehended from a corporation; and that, from the combinations between the fishermen, and their agents at Billingsgate, much imposition had been practised on the public.

The only persons who had injury to apprehend from the bill, were those concerned in the combinations carried on against the public at Billingsgate. The friends of the bill had in view the two-fold object, of raising boys for the navy, and cheapening and rendering plentiful an important article of wholesome food to the public.

I am aware, that this is but a very narrow and limited view of the subject. When I shall allude to the principles of the volunteer acts, I cannot well do it, without alluding to the other measures which his Majesty's govt, have adopted, for supporting, or deriving support from, that species of force, which it is the object of the present bill to render as efficient as the nature of such a body, and the principles of its institution, can reasonably admit: and before I enter upon the details of those other measures of defence, which the govt, has provided, I trust, my Lords, that I may be allowed to make a short observation on the exercise of a right, which I have ever understood to be inherent in the person vested with the executive power of the state&#x2014;I mean that prerogative residing in the Crown, of calling forth the services of all capable persons in the country, upon actual invasion, or strong apprehension of it. This right, my Lords, I conceive to be one of the indefeasible prerogatives of the King of this kingdom; not a prerogative of recent growth, but discoverable in every part of our history: and I own, that it was with much astonishment I heard it controverted1023on a former evening, by a noble earl on an opposite bench. I should Lope, my lords, that there is not a person in the empire, tolerably acquainted with the constitution, who can entertain a doubt that the principle contained in the preamble of the present bill namely, that it is the undoubted right of his Majesty to require the services upon certain emergencies, of all ranks of his people, is not a principle coeval with the earliest part of our history, and which, on many occasions, has received all the weight and authority, that the sanction of King, Lords, and Commons, could give it. It is upon that prerogative, which, I trust, will not be contested at this day, that theGeneral Defence Actof a former session was framed, and out of that act the present volunteer system has, in a great measure, arisen. But before I go into the consideration of this bill, I beg leave, my Lords, to advert to an observation made by a noble baron (Lord Grenville,) \"that much as he admired the volunteers and the loyal and patriotic spirit by which they were actuated, yet he never could consent to their being employed in any other way than as an auxiliary force, in which situation, he had no doubt, but that they would render incalculable service.\" My Lords, to the wisdom and policy of that observation, I most cordially agree; I never imagined, I never intended, that the volunteers should act in any other capacity than as a secondary and subsidiary force; and I am persuaded, that should they be ever called into the field in aid (I mean in that way in which their habits and degree of discipline have best fitted them for) of his Majesty's regular forces, that they will not belie the sanguine expectations that those, who look most favourably upon them, have formed.&#x2014;I wish, now, my Lords, to say a few words as to that other description of force provided by his Majesty's govt, and to which I must always consider the volunteers, as I have said before, secondary and subsidiary: and in communicating to this House, and to the country, the extent of that force, as high perhaps in point of number, certainly as high in character and discipline, as ever the energy and loyalty of a bee people supplied, I feel ample matter for confidence and exultation. My Lords, we have at this time within the United Kingdom, an army, composed of troops of the Hue and militia, amounting to no less than 180,000 men.1024When I compare this with the force which we had in the months of March and April, 1801, I find that it exceeds it by nearly 40,000. At that period, the peace of Lu-neville had established peace on the Continent, and the whole power of France, disembarrased from any other attack, was solely directed against this country; in addition to which, we were then involved in a contest with the Northern Powers, the issue of which was, to speak the most favourably of it, extremely precarious. We had then, my Lords, foreign possessions to garrison and defend, which required, as you all know, a farther addition to our force; and yet, with all the demands for it, and the menace of immediate invasion with which we were then threatened, superadded to them, our effective forces in the whole of our empire, internal and external, did not equal that army which we have in actual array at this moment for the defence of the united kingdom. I say, my Lords, our present effective force not only exceeds what we then possessed, but nearly equals the amount of the greatest military establishment that we entertained at any period of our history. I should hope, my Lords, that I have said enough to convince this House, that no measures that prudence and precaution could have suggested, for the protection and defence of this kingdom, have been neglected by the govt.; and that when we consider, that in audition to our regular forces, we have in G. Britain alone no less than 350,000 volunteers, we have some reason to look with confidence to an honourable termination of the present arduous and eventful contest. I mean, my Lords; to state distinctly, that the efficient volunteer force of this island amounts to 330,000, and I make this statement from the best authorities, not from the offers of service, not from the numbers enrolled, but from the returns of the different inspecting field officers. How and what is the best mode of employing this immense force, is a question which admits of many contrarieties of opinion. I know that many persons, whose opinions are entitled to very great attention, are decidedly averse from employing the volunteers, as other than an armed peasantry; and I must acknowledge that they argue to that effect with great plausibility. I fully concur in the idea, that one of the great advantages that the invaded possess over the invaders, is in the circumstance of having an armed po-1025pulation. I know that the advantages to be derived from the incessant attack of this species of force are incalculable in common wars. Where a war becomes protracted, and can only be terminated by a succession of ordinary campaigns; or one sanguinary one, in which every other day may produce a battle; there I will acknowledge the exertions, the activity, and the local advantages of an armed peasantry, may produce the most beneficial effects, and ultimately tend to the discomfiture and annihilation of the enemy. But where the enemy did not intend, and never could reasonably expect to make a permanent conquest; where they only calculated the extent and quantity of mischief they could effect in a given time, and that as short as possible, where they could look for no certain and considerable reinforcements, a position the most detrimental possible to an hostile army, then their object would be to push for the metropolis, or to get, if possible, possession of some of your great naval arsenals, for the purpose of destroying them. To defeat a sudden irruption of that kind, I know no force so competent as that of a regular force, or something nearly approaching to the steadiness and order of its discipline. Of that species of force I conceive the volunteers to be, and I am warranted in my opinion, by the judgment of many experienced military officers, that for the purpose of resisting sudden attack, or a forced march to an important point, they possess decided advantages over an irregular farce. I am aware, my Lords, that many persons also of great military information, have recommended that the volunteers should only be employed as a desultory force, and that to qualify them for that, it would be advise-able that they should unlearn every thing they had acquired in the way of military discipline. I do not see how that could be well done with prudence or safety, considering the crisis in which we are placed, and, I think, it will be more judicious to take the system as it at present is, with ail the disadvantages that may appertain to it. We all allow that the principle in itself is good; and where the advantages are numerous and apparent, and the disadvantages not great, I think that by adopting the system, such as it is, we best provide for the interest and safety of the state. The bill for the regulation of that system is now before the House, and I shall trespass but a little time longer on the pa-1026tience of noble Lords, while I call their attention to a few of the clauses in it. [The noble Lord here made a few observations on the different clauses relating to the exemptions, the right of resignation, and the election of officers.] I will not deny, my Lords, that there are very great anomalies in this bill, but, notwithstanding, I conceive that the safety of the country may be so essentially provided for by it, that I should hope it, the principle at least, may meet with no great opposition in this House. We are to consider that the volunteer force is of that nature, that it will advance in improvement every day, and that considering the different materials of which it is composed, it should be matter of surprize not that there have been some or so many irregularities, but that there have been so few. I know that it has been objected to the volunteer system, that it cannot be permanent, that it has been produced by the exigency of the moment, and that it contains the principles of dissolution in itself. Should that ever happen, of which I must acknowledge, my Lords, I see no reasonable ground of apprehension, it would then be the duty of ministers to advise his Majesty to recur to theGeneral Defence Act. By that act, his Majesty is authorised to call forth the services of all ranks of his people, and to dispose of them as may seem most fitting to him, for the protection of the state. But trust, my Lords, that his Majesty's ministers will never be reduced to the alternative of advising him to that measure. I have that confidence in the zeal, loyalty, and spirit of the volunteers, that should the moment of danger ever arrive, they will not be found wanting in their duty; that their energies will increase in proportion to the apprehension of invasion; and that they wall submit with readiness and cordiality to the various regulations which it is the object of the present bill to establish for the good order and discipline of a force, which I, for one, should be happy-to see last as long as the necessity that has given rise to it.", "author_id": "/people/mr-robert-jenkinson", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},
{"date": ["1804", "mar", "27"], "content": "&#x2014;My Lords; in this age, when we are daily accustomed to so many adventurous propositions, I really did not expect that any noble Lord would have ventured to question a radical, substantial, unquestionable, and hitherto never-questioned prerogative of the Crown, that of calling forth, upon emergency, the services of all the subjects of this realm. My Lords, from the earliest period of our history, we have been by statute a military people; and this right, inherent in the crown, from the Norman conquest to this day, and which I contend to be indefeasible, cannot be abandoned without the commission of an act of political suicide, both by his Majesty and by his people. My Lords, I have in my pockets one of the most solemn documents to support the opinion I have given, a document carrying the authority of King, Lords, and Commons, and concurred in by what, perhaps, the noble Earl who spoke last, may think of very little consequence, the opinion of the judges who administered justice at that period. My Lords, the document. I allude to} is, I will admit, not to he found in any of our statute books,1028but its authority is not in the least weakened by that. I hold in my hand a copy of the commission of Array, passed in the 5th year of Henry the IVth. and to be found in page 527, of the third roll of parliament. That identical statute referred to by Sir Ed. Coke, in his 4th institute, which was written in the reign of lames the 1st, was acknowledged by him to be the law of the land at that day, and it has continued so to be to this very instant, for it has never been repealed either positively or by any inference or implication whatever. That statute, my Lords, solemnly recognizes that it is a prerogative inherent in his Majesty, to require, in critical cases, such as invasion, or even the apprehension of invasion, the services of all subjects capable of bearing arms, or, in the words of the commission, of all those, \"potentes et habiles in corpore.\" And, my Lords, this is not a solitary assertion of that right, but it is to be found at various periods of our history, and particularly in the reigns of Henry VII. of Ed. VI. and of Henry II. This, my Lords, is a right consequent to the sword, it does not exclusively belong to the sovereign of this country, but is inherent in whom ever may possess the executive power in any state. If the noble Lord will refer to Vattel, or any other of the writers upon the laws of nations, he will find that they are unanimous in declaring, that such a power makes part of the prerogative, whether royal or executive, in all the countries that possess any thing like a legitimate or civilized government. As to the noble Earl's supposition, that this prerogative conferred the power of throwing all classes of persons indiscriminately into the ranks, I must decidedly oppose it. No, my Lords, no such abuse of it can ever be committed; men are to be employed according to their states, to their habits of life, and to the modes in which they may be most useful. But I trust, that in case of extreme necessity, no man, who bears the semblance and appearance of a man, who values his country and his domestic ties, and who is to fight body to body, pro aris et focis, will stickle about the mode in which his energies can be most advantageously brought into action. My Lords, unfitted even as I am by habit and education for maintaining such a contest, yet in such a case of extreme necessity, I should not think I did my duty to my country, or to my. children, if I did not cast this gown1029from my back, and employ every faculty of my mind, and of my body, to grapple with the enemy. I shall not at present make any observations on the principle, or the provisions of this bill. I rose merely, conceiving myself alluded to by the noble Earl, for the purpose of declaring what I understood the law to be as to a particular point, and I trust I have satisfied him, as well as other noble Lords,", "author_id": "/people/mr-edward-law-1", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},

{"date": ["1804", "mar", "27"], "content": "began by expressing his satisfaction that those who found it their duty to oppose the bill, were not now supposed to be enemies to the volunteer system. It would, indeed, be strange, that those who had used the utmost exertions to consolidate that system, should for a moment be considered as individuals who wished it to be dissolved, even under the present critical circumstances of the empire. No man, he would affirm, could entertain a higher idea than he did of the zeal, the energy, and the spirit of the people of England; and no idea could be more monstrous than to suppose that 400,000 volunteers, who had stepped forward in defence of who liberties and independence of their country; would not be found capable of the most important services. It was not that he doubted of the courage of the volunteers of England, but it was keeping in view, that those whom they were to encounter were troops of undoubted courage, and who had enjoyed the advantage of a degree of discipline obtained in not less than 12 campaigns, in which they were opposed to all the best disciplined troops in Europe. With the knowledge of the enemy to be opposed, it was undoubtedly the duty of ministers to have directed their principal attention to that description of force which was to be encountered. In the present bill, his Lordship declared that he saw not the slightest evidence of a regular military system. Since the commencement of the war, he had hitherto seen no evidence of a system adequate to the crisis in which we were placed, the various parts of which had any reasonable degree of relation or connection. What he had principally to object to the volunteer system, as it at present stood, was, that it had stood in the way of every other department of the national defence. The recruiting not merely of the regulars, but the filling up of the militia, had been materially affected by the provision which the bill now contained. A noble Lord had stated one fact, which effectually proved the assertion which he had submitted to their Lordships' consideration. The fact to which he referred was, that in the county of Kent, at the breaking out of the war, there were not more them 37 individuals embodied1036out of the whole quota required for that district. Could there, he desired to ask their Lordships, be a more decisive proof of the improvidence and culpable neglect of ministers? Was it not admitted that the peace was not considered to be lasting? Was it not allowed by ministers themselves, that during the short interval of peace, the whole conduct of the enemy had been one uniform system of violence and aggression? On what principle it was, then, that the ministers disbanded the militia, or were so backward in re-embodying them, he could not pretend to decide. Their conduct in this instance was hardly reconcilable to any of the ordinary principles of human affairs. It was a subject of considerable interest to look to the successive measures of Ministers for the defence of the country. The first in any point of view calculated to secure the augmentation of the regular army, was the bill for raising the army of reserve. But how was the operation of this act encouraged by subsequent proceedings? The conduct of Ministers was characterised by their usual confusion and irregularity. They immediately introduced theGeneral Defence Act, and much time was employed in reducing this measure to any degree of consistency. Hardly two days elapsed, before in two or three lines the whole measure is rendered nugatory. Ministers take on themselves to hold forth, that voluntary offers of service shall be commuted for the provisions of theGeneral Training Act. Not contented with this, they introduce a most extensive and unparalleled system of exemptions. They go so far as to introduce into a volunteer bill provisions, exempting not only from the ballots for the militia and army of reserve then in existence, but from all ballots which might afterwards be appointed by a solemn act of the legislature. What the effect of such a system was, he needed not to enlarge on. It must be obvious to every noble Lord who took the trouble to exercise his judgment on the subject, that such provisions were utterly incompatible with the existence of a regular army. He desired their Lordships to reflect on what had been done for the military defence of the country since the commencement of the present session of Parliament. About 5 months had already elapsed, and all that had hitherto, been brought forward to perfect our military system was, to lay on the table of their1037Lordships a bill which he must be forgiven in pronouncing altogether nugatory. I struck him that the bill was quite inefficient to any great object, not only from the absence of many important previsions, but from the presence of others which were not only useless, but, in his view, highly reprehensible. How far the present objectionable clauses might be removed or amended, he would not now pretend to decide, though he certainly had no very sanguine hope, that even after every effort to improve it, the bill could be rendered adequate to any great permanent object. Considered as a separate measure, it was altogether inefficient. Viewed as a part of a whole, it was utterly incompatible with every other part of the system applicable to the crisis in which the country was placed. He was hardly required to repeat what he had said at the outset of his observations, that he had the most perfect reliance on the zeal and spirit of the volunteers in every part of the empire. At the same time he could not help saying, that the species of force most applicable to the national danger, was that which ministers were in duty bound to bring forward with the least possible delay. Of the courage of the volunteers it was impossible to entertain a doubt; and after the previous experience which had been obtained of the service of the militia, no man would pretend that they were not to be considered as a most important part of our national defence. Ministers, however, ought to have properly balanced the means of uniting and harmonizing the application of these different establishments, so as in the least possible degree to interfere with the military force of the country. So far, however, from having pursued this system, ministers had sacrificed the regular army to establishments, undoubtedly highly useful in themselves, but not applicable to circumstances of extraordinary danger. Instead of any encouragement being held out to the regular army, it had been thwarted, opposed, and embarrassed. He really was astonished at the language employed this evening by the noble Sec. of State. He had made use of an expression which, for his own part, was quite novel in the manner in which it had been applied. The noble Lord had spoken of the volunteers and the militia as an established force, and this he seemed to wish their Lordships to consider in contradistinction to our regular army.1038This was a sort of language which he professed himself utterly unable to comprehend. He allowed all due praise to the spirit of the volunteers and the militia, but he was desirous that they should be viewed on their proper footing. As to the army of reserve, he saw them in no other light generally than as a depot of recruits for the regular army. Some degree of triumph appeared to be entertained as to the present state of our military establishment. He could not imagine that the noble Lord opposite would persist in holding such language. As the best answer to any statement of this nature, he should wish to be informed, what augmentation had been gained for the regular army since the commencement of the last session? He did not at all mean to deny that the militia, as applicable to local service, might be viewed as to a considerable degree efficient. He was so far from wishing to hold them up in any inferior light, that one of his great objections to the bill was, that the filling up of the quotas for the militia had, by the provisions of the bill, been materially retarded. What he objected to was, that service in a volunteer corps protected not against one ballot for the militia, but against ballots even before the militia were completed. He begged leave to say, that the system pursued by ministers on this subject was essentially different from that pursued during the late war. He did not deny that the volunteer establishment, during the late war, was one which admitted of exemptions from the militia ballots, but the exemption was given under quite different circumstances. During the late war, the exemptions given to the volunteers succeeded the embodying of the militia; whereas, as the exemptions now stood, they accompanied and materially interfered with the filling up of the militia. But he begged leave to state, that this was not only the case during the late war, when the volunteers were first established, but after it was judged necessary to extend their numbers. Previous to this augmentation, the supplementary militia had been called for, and it was not till this additional force was filled up, that further offers of voluntary service were accepted. The exemptions given to the volunteers were really far beyond any idea which was entertained on the subject. Hardly two days elapsed after theGeneral Training Acthad been passed, before, by the single clause of. a commutation for1039Voluntary service, the whole act was virtually rescinded. He believed that the public at large knew nothing of this most extraordinary alteration. He could on his own behalf state, that though only at a distance of 26 miles from the metropolis, he knew nothing of the matter; and that he first was apprised of this new bill while he was busy in explaining the provisions of theGeneral Training Act, and pointing out the superiority of voluntary offers of service. No sooner was it seen that a deficiency of volunteers was likely to be experienced, than ministers made known their views of these extended exemptions. The volunteer system unexpectedly increased much beyond what they thought necessary; and here again they stepped in to check and embarrass the exertions and enthusiasm of the people. The people were to be perpetually trifled with, and when volunteers did not appear in sufficient numbers, they were to be brought forward by threats of theGeneral Training Bill. It was not at all his object to dispute, under particular circumstances, the right of the Sovereign to call out the population of the country. He must, however, strongly object to the clause in the bill by which that power was defined. As the clause now stood, the power professing to be vested in the crown was monstrous and unconstitutional beyond all previous example. He could not pretend to be so well versed as a noble and learned Lord who had preceded him, in what had been very properly styled the antiquity of the law. Many of the cases cited by the learned Lord did, however, appear to him quite inapplicable to the present age, and the present circumstances of this country. Much stress had been laid on the authority of Vattel, whose Treatise on the Law of Nations he had heard repeatedly styled a repository of the lumber of antiquity. He would net. enter the lists with the noble Lord as to the constitutional opinions entertained in the time of Hen. III. and Edw. I with respect to the power of the Sovereign to call out the population of the country. He did not controvert the doctrine of the Sovereign's right generally stated. In the present age, however, it was not to be received without a certain degree of limitation. It was the act not of the Sovereign personally, but of the Sovereign acting under the sanction and authority of Parliament. This was the only intelligible1040use of the right in a country professing to be governed by a system of laws fairly and justly administered. When the power was exercised at ail, it was to be generally and justly applied. It was not to be made the instrument of injustice, of partiality, or revenge. To suppose that it could be exercised in this way, would be to subvert the whole system of a free govt. To pretend that the prerogative of the crown extended so far, as that any individuals, could at pleasure be transferred, either to a regiment of the line, or to a militia regiment, was a position altogether monstrous and abominable. It was objected, and justly, to the odious and tyrannical govt, of France, that the people were liable to be driven to every species of military service. With what propriety, then, could ministers call on the people of this country to stand forth in defence of our constitution, if the monstrous power to which he had now alluded was sanctioned? His Lordship contended, that a clause in the bill did sanction such a power, and that this was the first instance of such an arbitrary arrangement in the whole annals of the country. He wished to know from what source such an odious doctrine was derived. It could not derive its origin from the feudal times, for there the terms of service were expressly limited. Was it from the example of the issuing of commissions of array? He conceived that it would be wasting time to shew that these commissions afforded no argument for the unconstitutional power granted by the bill. At the commencement of the civil wars, such a power was contended for by the crown lawyers; but all the ablest legal authorities of that day resisted it. Se convinced was the King of the illegality of the power, that it was not acted upon in any instance. After the restoration, it was not attempted to be carried into practice, and militia laws soon after were substituted in its room. His Lordship, after insisting on this constitutional point; with great force of argument, concluded by declaring, that the bill was very tar from meeting his approbation.

When the measure should come in a fall and regular manner before the1054House, then would be the time to enter upon the discussion of it. It was now in the contemplation of his Majesty's ministers to submit to Parliament a measure for the general defence of the United Kingdom, which would comprise several improvements in the militia systems of G.

He was fully convinced of the impolitic and injudicious nature of introducing into the army a deliberative spirit, which had its origin in the volunteer system. Parliament was the place where deliberation ought to take place; and they ought, in the first instance, to adopt measures which it would be incumbent on the military of every description to obey, instead of having their deliberation dependent upon any voluntary offers that might be made. It was impossible certainly to withhold the highest tribute of applause from the men who had made the present patriotic, spirited, and loyal offer of an extended service.

He most entirely concurred with what the noble Marquis (of Sligo) had said, that the two countries ought to be united closely together, not in name only, but in effect; and lie believed that the reciprocal services of the militia of both countries would be a desirable thing; but it ought to be recollected, that his Majesty's ministers had been advised to extend the services of the militia of Ireland, when they were raised at the beginning of the war, to this country.

The offers of the militia, during the late war, to serve in Ireland, had arisen from the spur of the occasion, and were therefore properly accepted and appreciated.

{"date": ["1804", "may", "03"], "content": "The hon. Gentleman is quite entitled at any time before the Second Reading of a Bill to call attention246to what he may consider imperfections in its title as not concerning the scope and purport of the Bill. I understand that the specific point to which he has referred is this. There is a sub-section of the Bill&#x2014;Sub-section (f) of Clause 3&#x2014;which states that&#x2014;The time appointed for the meeting of Parliament may be at any time not less than 20 clear days after the Proclamation.The hon. Gentleman says there is no reference to this in the title of the Bill. I may say I have already had considerable difficulty with the title of this Bill, and I will mention one point which has given me particular difficulty. It is with reference to Sub-section (2) of Clause 1, which enacts that&#x2014;So much of any Act as requires that any person or premises shall be rated, or the name of any person shall be inserted in the rate book, or any assessed taxes on poor or other rate shall be paid for the purpose of entitling a person to be a Parliamentary or local government elector shall be repealed.The question which was put to me privately, and which I decided privately, was whether this was within the title, inasmuch as there was no specific reference in the title to the rating clauses. I would say first that the title of this Bill is so specific that, having entered into detail, it would naturally cause comment as to why any particular detail has been omitted. In fact, the very specific items mentioned in the title of the Bill necessarily call attention to what has been excluded from the title. I decided, however, in reference to the case I have mentioned, that the rating clauses were intimately connected with the period of qualification. If the period of qualification were shortened from 12 months to six months or throe months, that would necessarily affect the question of the rating clauses and the question of the voter being upon the rate book. Now, the hon. Gentleman asks me on another point whether the particular question of the alteration of time between the Proclamation and the meeting of Parliament is included in the title. I am clearly of opinion that it is included in the title, and for this reason. The hon. Gentleman will observe that the words at the end of the title are, \"and for purposes consequential thereon.\" If the words had been \"connected therewith\" they would have no Parliamentary force or effect whatever; but the words \"consequential247thereon\" make a considerable difference. The hon. Gentleman will ask me why it is consequential, and consequential upon what? The period between the Proclamation of Parliament and the meeting of Parliament has already been the subject of several distinct Statutes. As the hon. Member has stated, the period has been 50 days, 40 days, and 35 days, and it is now proposed to reduce that time to 20 days. The reason for that period between the Proclamation and the meeting of Parliament was this: to give time for the Writs to reach remote constituencies, and to enable Members from all parts of the Kingdom to meet here in sufficient time for the meeting of Parliament, and that they might be able to get here without undue inconvenience; and looking at the state of locomotion in those days, the period was fixed to enable specifically the Member for Orkney and Shetland to get here in time. If it is enacted by a Parliament that there should be a taking of the poll throughout England on one and the same day, and a much earlier day than heretofore, this does away with the necessity for so very long a period elapsing between the Proclamation and the meeting of Parliament. That I take to be the direct and particular reason why the period between the Proclamation and the meeting of Parliament is altered. There would be no force in maintaining the old periods of 40, 50, or even 35 days when all the polls are held on the same day, because with a much shorter period than this it would be possible without inconvenience for all Members of the House to assemble at Westminster. Therefore, I take it that the alteration of the period to 20 days is directly consequential upon the enactment that all the polls shall be taken on the same day. I should like to add that the title of this Bill is unduly specific, and that there is no necessity whatever in the title of a Bill to enter into such particularities. All that is necessary&#x2014;and it is a much safer process&#x2014;is that the title of the Bill shall be in general terms and cover the general scope and purport so as to include all the subject-matters comprised in the Bill. In 1854 a Standing Order was passed which enacted that the admissibility of Amendments in Committee should be in future determined, not by the title of the Bill, but by its scope and248purport and substance, and that any Amendments relative to the subject-matter of the Bill should be admitted without an Instruction, and if during Committee any alterations are made beyond the title, then the title of the Bill could be amended. I have stated those facts to the House because a too specific and yet imperfect description may create considerable trouble in the event of there being left out all notice of particular clauses of the Bill. But in this case I think the provision for shortening the period of the meeting of the new Parliament is within the terms of the title and directly consequential on the provision for the taking the polls on one day. For these reasons I am clearly of opinion that the Bill need not be withdrawn and that the discussions on the Second Reading may proceed.", "author_id": "/people/baron-charles-abbot", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

Sufficient has been said to justify the concurrence of this house in the motion that has just now been submitted to them. At a time when we are engaged in a war about matters of the highest moment, at a time when our enemies have menaced us with invasion, and when their schemes have been rendered abortive only by the persevering zeal of our countrymen, and our30fleet, which has blockaded every port of the enemy, from the Adriatic to the Texel, at such a time, and in such circumstances, I trust that every one will feel it his first duly to grant his majesty that support which he now requires, and which every thing tells us ought to be given. At the time, sir, when we are told that we have a new enemy to contend with; an enemy, I fear, misled by weak counsels, and goaded on by the tyrannical and despotic power of France; an enemy whose hostile disposition every circumstance has concurred to prove; we ought not to be backward in meeting our difficulties with that resolution and firmness which the danger calls for. There are moments, sir, when to much forbearance becomes pusillanimity. One of these moments has now arrived. I shall not enter minutely into this question till the documents promised by his Majesty are laid before us. Then will be the proper time to consider it particularly. To discuss it at present at any length, would be altogether premature. I am most happy, at the pacific overtures that have been made to his majesty by the French govt.: God grant they may be sincere, and that they may pave the way for a safe and permanent peace! In the mean time, I have no doubt that the govt. of this country will act with that dignity and moderation which become the character of a great nation, which is anxious to preserve the peace of the world, though it cannot suffer its own honour and security to be trifled with. We have heard, sir, of the internal prosperity, the increasing, commerce and; wealth of our country, and who could, hear it without the greatest satisfaction I While they secure us the means of prosecuting the war with vigour, in case that should be necessary, they at the same time furnish us with the ability to secure a peace on safe and honourable terms, in case our enemies should begin to be, swayed by principles of justice and moderation. I hope, sir, we shall carry to the, foot of the throne the strongest assurances of our firm determination to support his majesty, in whatever measures he may judge advisable for attaining the great objects which we have in view&#x2014;security and national prosperity. With these sentiments, sir, I most heartily second the motion of the hon. gent., and hope that we shall all willingly and zealously rally round our. King and constitution to preserve them in safety and honour, at a crisis the most31momentous that G. Britain or Europe ever experienced.&#x2014;After the motion had been thus seconded, the speaker read the address to the house, and was proceeding to put the question, when", "author_id": "/people/mr-charles-adams", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1805", "jan", "15"], "content": "rose and spoke to the following purport: It is not my intention, sir, to trouble the house for any long time upon this occasion, for I certainly do not mean to move an amendment to the address now proposed, nor to advert to any but a few parts of it; but I wish to make a few observations on what appear to me to be two considerable omissions in his majesty's speech; for there is one part of the address on which I do not know how, uninformed is we are at present, we can give an opinion; although, perhaps, there would be no material difference of sentiment, if we understood it, but of which, without information, we cannot judge. I allude to that part of the address in which we say we approve of his majesty's determination not to explain himself further to us on an interesting subject, until he has had intercourse with certain powers. Now, it does not appear to me, I confess, upon the first view of it, that there was any necessity of entering into, that sort of explanation. It may be necessary, or wise, for his majesty to express his wishes for peace, and to communicate to the world that he is willing to enter into the discussion of, and to accede to such terms as were likely, or which ought to produce it; but, when he says he cannot enter into such considerations, until he has consulted certain courts, I do not see how we can approve of this conduct, until we know what is the nature of the intercourse between this Country and the continental powers. Now, though if this were understood generally, or if I understood it, there would probably be no difference of opinion, yet as I do not know, and am not permitted to know, those circumstances, which call for intercourse with other powers, I must think feat the address pledges the house to too much; that it pledges it to approbation of the determination not to explain at present the nature of the communications in question. But as to this explanation in itself, I, for one, must confess that I see no necessity for any explanation, but what appears already on the face of the speech: for his majesty there expresses himself clearly, making professions of a wish for peace. His majesty says directly, that he entertains this wish, but can give no fur-32ther explanation until he has consulted certain powers, not allies indeed, but powers with which he has certain discustions, certain confidential intercourse. As I said before, it is impossible to judge of the propriety of all this, until we know the nature of that confidential intercourse j though if I did know it, I might, perhaps, be one to approve of it; but how can the house approve of a statement, the occasion and circumstances of which it does not know?&#x2014;There is one omission in the address which I own has a great deal disappointed me. After what passed three or tour years ago on the subject of the Catholics of Ireland, I did expect, when I heard the name of the lion, mover, that the very first communication from the throne would have had a reference to that subject. I did hope, that his majesty would have been advised, by some one of his present ministers at least, to recommend to parliament the taking of that subject into consideration, in order to afford to us the full effect of the union, and to give to that part of the united kingdom that advantage which I think so essential to its peace. I say, my surprise was increased at this omission when I first heard the name of the hon. gent, who moved this address. I cannot help lamenting, that in the speech from the throne, there is not one word expressive of an intention to recommend that subject to our consideration: a subject so important, that if it be not speedily taken into consideration, no honest man can say there is any thing like stability and security to that part of the British empire. Nor could I collect any allusion to that subject even from the speech of the hon. gent, himself. He spoke indeed of the defensive state of Ireland; but that is a subject I shall not now discuss. I hope Ireland is well defended; but I know the best defence of Ireland is that which is the best defence of England, and of every country in the world-&#x2014;the pure affection and united attachment of the people to the govt. under which they live, and by which they are protected.&#x2014; There is another omission, which, although not less important, is still more surprising. I have observed on former occasions, that when measures have been taken by parliament for the purpose of increasing the power of the country, it was usual for his majesty to compliment us (when I have thought, very often, we had ill-deserved it) on the wisdom of our measures, but33how many such compliments may have been just, (for I hope they were not all unjust), I will not discuss, nor to whom they were to be imputed. Some have declared, what others have denied, this to be a new administration; and that the measures we have now are more vigorous. Be that as it may, I expected we should have been told something of the efficacy of our measures, not merely alluding to the discipline of our volunteers, the skill of our navy, and the public spirit of the people; but that we should have heard something by way of commendation of some of our measures; but no notice is taken of any thing of that kind. Nothing is said of that measure which was supposed to make the whole difference between an administration of imbecility and that of vigour; I mean the measure of the right hon. gent. (Mr. Pitt) for the improvement of our military system. I expected we should have heard something of the difference between the two, but not a word. I believe that measure is now allowed to have totally failed. Speaking in the language of common sense, I take the purpose for which that measure was designed, and with a view to which it was adopted, to have completely failed; the consequence of which must be one of two things: either we must give up the object which we had in view by that measure, or adopt some other mode of carrying it into effect. Yet it did give me some surprise, that nothing was said upon that measure itself: neither was our attention called to any thing of that nature. I hope and trust we shall have these matters soon discussed; and in this I am the more confident, when I recollect that those who had not been generally the first to advise the house to take into its own Lands, as some persons called it, the functions of executive govt. by originating measures for the safety of the country in this house, had been resolute on points similar to this, feeling, as they said they did, they could not safely leave them to ministers. The right hon. gent, not only supported measures of that kind, but brought some of them forward himself; and, although he did not then persuade the house to adopt them, yet he had nearly all the effect of persuasion, by convincing the house that something of the kind ought to be adopted. I hope that system will be followed up now; for as to the efficiency of the new bill I have just alluded to, which kept the house in a suc-34cession of debates, I believe that is entirely out of the question. I believe the advantage of it, as a system to increase the military strength of the country, to be none.&#x2014;As to the Spanish war, his majesty informs the house, that he intends to lay the papers before us relative to that subject, and therefore to prejudge it would be unwise. I have, however, no difficulty in saying, that the seizing of the Spanish frigates, loaded and destined as they were, does certainly bear an unseemly appearance, and one not much to the honour of this country. Never was there a time when this nation ought to stand so clear of all reproaches similar to those which I allude to in, the present instance.&#x2014;There is mention made in the speech of the violation of the law of nations by the French govt. We should never look at such conduct without the most pointed disapprobation; bur, if we are to make that a part of the war in which we are engaged, it is exceedingly material that we, who thus contend for good faith, moderation, and justice, should be ourselves faithful, moderate, and jus;. 1 should have thought so at any time, and under any circumstances; but more especially at this time, and under the present circumstances, as we make the want of justice and moderation the principal cause of the war. I therefore hope, that neither Spain, nor any of the surrounding nations, whether neutral or at war, whether they vie with each other for outrage, violation, and contempt of the law of nations, or for their reverence for them, will not have it in their power to accuse us justly of any outrage, violation, or contempt of the law of nations, or even, of any indifference to the principles of equity and moderation; and I hope that no partiality for our own country will induce us to overlook any of those principles, whether we look towards Spain or any other power; but that we shall view our own conduct as we would that of a nation that was indifferent to us, with a, due regard to the principles of strict justice and absolute impartiality. I would go further, and say, that, under all the circumstances that belong to this contest, I would not insist on strict justice in every particular, against the power in dispute with us; and I hope the question, whenever it comes to be discussed, will be discussed with good temper and propriety.", "author_id": "/people/mr-charles-fox-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

He had not brought forward the subject of catholic emancipation during the existence of a cabinet avowedly hostile to that measure; nay, whose very elevation to power was founded on their opposition to it; but it was very different when the cabinet professed a desire to have this measure brought about, and when the person at the head of the cabinet had given an open avowed opinion in favour both of its policy and its justice. This was sufficient to justify the consistency of his hon. friend in recommending the subject to the right hon. gent, at the present moment.&#x2014;But, leaving this topic, the right hon. gent, proceeded to make some observations on the information conveyed by the speech, respecting the state of our continental connections. He was free to acknowledge, that he thought the information on this subject extremely scanty and unsatisfactory. He had expected and hoped something distinct and specific, but he had been disappointed. The house were indeed told of the wise and dignified manifestation of the interest entertained by the Emperor of Russia for the independence of the continent; but the39house had no means of knowing to what extent that Sovereign was disposed to cooperate with us against France, or what exertions he was willing to make for the restoration of the ancient balance of power in Europe. As, however, a prospect of further information was held out; as the house were led to believe that satisfactory documents would be afforded, he had the less hesitation in agreeing to the address. &#x2014;Having stated this generally, the right hon. gent, went on to make a few remarks on the language of the address, relative to the rupture with Spain, lie was rather afraid that the language conveyed something too much like an approbation of the rupture, even before the house were in possession of the documents necessary to found an opinion. Perhaps he was mistaken in this, but the words sounded in his ears very much as if this were their import, and he was therefore anxious to guard against any idea that the house gave the slightest sanction either to the rupture with Spain or the detention of the Spanish frigates. Though in the absence of all documents the house could not pronounce either final approbation or final disapprobation, yet he must contend, that it was not therefore necessary or proper that nothing should be said. On the contrary, it was is many cases desirable, that an opinion should be given on the successive stages of a business of this sort as they severally appealed at the time. In private causes, where few were interested besides the parties, where the whole was dispatched in a short time, judgment might, and ought, in general, to be deferred to the last. There was nothing to make it necessary that any opinion should be declared, till the whole was gone through. Bui not so in these causes of nations, tried before the tribunal of the world, and where the parts did not succeed each other but at long intervals. It might then be often of great consequence, that the feelings of people should manifest themselves, on the several states of the question as they successively arose. He should be sorry, for instance, in the present case, if, informed of this cause no further than they then were, any sentiment could be felt about it, but that of strong reprobation, and if, moreover, that sentiment were not expressed. It was useful to have it known, how individuals, bow the country felt upon the question such as it then appeared; reserving, of course, their40final judgment till the whole of the case should be finally before them. He was anxious, therefore, to be understood as stating his opinion, subject to such explanations as might here after be given, (which he could not deny to lie possible, but was wholly unable to anticipate, and should be most happy to hear) that the principle and policy of the war wre, to say the least of them, highly questionable, and the mode of commencing it the most disgraceful and criminal of any that he could call to mind. This was the feeling which-he had at present, and which, be feared, he must continue to keep, should it not happily be done away by the disclosure of circumstances not now known, nor easily conjectured. He had an observation to make on the description given in the address of the stale of our regular army, which is said to be in a respectable condition. If the respectability spoken of was meant to be applied to the quality of cur regular force, no one could assent to the statement mere cheerfully. No man had a higher opinion than he had of the valour and discipline of our regular army. If, on the other hand, it was applied to their number, he could by no means admit the truth of this assertion. The address spoke of the improved discipline of our numerous volunteers. On that subject he would only remark, that admitting the improvement really to have taken place, the statement should have been, the improved discipline of our less numerous volunteers.&#x2014; He really could not help thinking, that the language of the address respecting the invasion was quite superfluous, and might very easily have been omitted. We had no evidence that the enemy had given up the threat of invasion. We only knew that his preparations were now more complete than at any former period. The enemy had not thought proper to disclose to us when his long threatened attack was actually to take place; and there was no sort of evidence, that if once seriously entertained, it was now seriously abandoned. The wording of the speech was, indeed, cautious in that respect. It did not say that our preparationshaddeterred him, but that they weresufficientto deter him. But even this had better have been omitted. As we knew nothing about the matter, we had better have said nothing about it, The right hon. gent, next touched on the violent and unjust proceedings of the French govt. mentioned in the address,41Among these, there were few more marked and direct, than that which was now operating in the person of Capt. Wright, of the Vincejo ship of war. This of-officer, as the house would probably know, was taken valiantly fighting on board his ship, in circumstances of the most clear and legitimate warfare; but, because the enemy chose to entertain suspicions respecting former services performed by him, and which, if true, would be nothing to their purpose, was detained a close prisoner in the Temple, and threatened even with farther proceedings, contrary to every rule and practice of war, as observed among civilized nations. He had now remained in that situation longer than he (Mr. W.) could immediately state (persons who view misfortunes at a distance do not count the period of their duration, as, it was to be feared, he must do who reckoned his days and hours through the bars of a prison), and far longer than it was for the honour of this country that be should have so remained. The right hon. gent, said, he had brought forward the subject at the close of the last session, and he now renewed it at the commencement of the present. If ministers were doing their duty, as he had reason to hope they were, the mention of the subject, and the manner in which, he was sure, it would be received by the house, would give support to their endeavours. If they were not, the same circumstances would serve as an admonition, and co-operate with the opinion which be wished to impress, that if other means failed, it was high time to have recourse to measures, which, whether effectual or not, must at last be resorted to, namely, the use of a similar treatment to all those officers whom the fortune of war had thrown into our power. These were the only means which nations had of enforcing a due observance of the laws of war, in favour of those who risked themselves honourably in their service. &#x2014;The right hon. gent, before he sat down, expressed his regret that his hon. friend (Mr. Fox) had not given notice of the renewal of his motion, for a committee to examine the state of the national defence. He thought such a committee fully as necessary now as at the period when it was proposed last session. If his hon. friend, or some other gent, did not take up the business, he should certainly think it his duty to bring it under consideration on an early day.

He had been led to give up this motion by a spirit of accommodation to the right hon. gent. on the other side of the house, and to generalise the motions he on that occasion submitted; but as it often happened, that whilst acting under such an impulse, a man might concede more than upon reflection he would deem consistent with prudence or discretion, he proposed in the present instance, to correct his former omission by a specific motion. His object in making it was, to ascertain the number of men that had been raised in col. French's levy. He was aware, that as his former motions took in the new levies in England, Ireland, and Scotland, it might be said that his present motion was included in one of them. But* as the only inconve-142nience that could be apprehended from it would be, that col. French's levy would be returned in the double, that inconvenience would be obviated by his moving for a separate return of that levy. He therefore moved, \"that there be laid before the house a separate return of the number of effective men raised for the levy now recruiting by col. French, for general service, in the united kingdom; distinguishing the number of recruits finally approved, up to the last return; also the number that bad received bounties as boys, and the number of officers appointed iii that levy.\" Ordered.", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-windham-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1805", "feb", "01"], "content": "expressed his surprise at some of the observations which fell from the noble earl. With respect, however, to the papers and documents in question, he would first say, that they were more voluminous than he had formerly occasion to apprehend, snaking a166quantity of not less than 70 printed pages. Every exertion was used to get the papers ready for presentation that day, but it was found impracticable; and it was wished the house should meet to-morrow, for the purpose of laying the papers on the table with the earliest possible opportunity. With respect to the blame which the noble earl seemed to impute to him, for his conduct on the occasion, he must say, he thought no blame could fairly be imputed to him, either for what he had done in the first instance, or in the subsequent proceedings. He had certainly, according to what he had professed, laid every information before the house, which he thought necessary, for the due understanding of the subject. He had professed his anxious wish to have the subject fully and completely before parliament and the public, and on that principle he acted. The idea of producing additional information, it should be recollected, did not originate with him; it was deemed, upon maturer consideration of the topics, to be necessary by other persons, and in other quarters. In conformity, therefore, with the wish to have every degree of information which might be deemed necessary before parliament and the public, it was, that he had proposed the production of the additional documents; and this with as little delay as possible: in which view, and with reference to an early discussion of, and decision upon, the subject, it was proposed to meet to-morrow. Such an attack upon ministers as that proceeding from the noble earl, he had never yet heard of. He had heard of attacks upon ministers, for withholding due information in the first instance, and pertinaciously refusing it afterwards; but never, till that day, did he hear them blamed for wishing to give every possible information upon a. subject. He had heard of attacks upon ministers, for wishing to urge a premature discussion of particular topics; but never, till then, did he hear any ministers arraigned for postponing the day, in order to afford a full and ample interval for deliberation. With respect to the noble earl's idea, that a wish existed with his maj.'s present ministers, to induce a servile imitation, on the part of that house, of the proceedings of the other house of parliament, it was entirely unfounded, Did such a desire manifest itself in an obvious wish to give their lordships as full and complete information upon the167subject in question, as that which was proposed to be given to the other house? Did a line of proceeding, obviously intended to enable that house to discuss and decide upon the subject, on at least as early a day as the other house, argue a wish to make their lordships the servile imitators and followers of that house? Certainly not. So much for the assertion of the noble earl on that head, and the wish to meet to-morrow being in strict conformity to every principle laid down by his majesty's ministers in that house for their conduct; with respect to the subject in question, he did not see how any noble lord could consistently object to the proceeding.", "author_id": "/people/mr-henry-phipps", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},

Rawlins, knt. and R. A. Cox, esq. late sheriffs of this city, and late sheriff of the county of Middlesex, for their firm, manly, and conscientious discharge of the various important duties of that high office, in a year of unprecedented public duty, for their-liberality and humane attention to the several prisoners confided to their care; and for the zeal they have manifested in support of the rights and privileges of their fellow citizens, and of the British constitution, by preserving inviolate that great bulwark of public liberty, the freedom of election&#x2014;Woodthorpe;\" and the petitioners state, that while in the execution of such office of sheriffs of the city of London, the petitioners having, upon the election aforesaid of four citizens to represent the said city in parliament, returned sir W. Curtis, bait, sir J. W. Anderson, bart. H. C. Combe, esq. and sir C. Price, bart. to represent the same, a petition was, by sir W. Lewes, knt. an unsuccessful candidate at such election, presented to the house against the return of the four citizens aforesaid, and against the petitioners, for making such return as sheriffs of the city of London aforesaid; which petition being by the house referred to a select committee appointed to try and determine the same, was by such committee voted frivolous and vexatious; and the petitioners were thereby entitled to be reimbursed the heavy costs and damages they had been put to in defending themselves against such unjust charge so brought against them.; but, from the distressed circumstances of the said sir W. Lewes, knt. the petitioners have not to this hour, nor are at any time hereafter likely to be, reimbursed the same, or any the smallest part thereof; and that two other petitions were presented to the house; the one by W. Mainwaring, esq. the unsuccessful candidate at the said election for the county of Middlesex; and the other by certain freeholders of the said county in his interest, complaining of the return made by the petitioners of sir F. Burdett, bart. And charging the petitioners, as sheriffs of Middlesex, and returning officers at such last-mentioned election for that county, with great partiality in favour of the said sir F. Burdett, and with other undue conduct in the course and progress of the said135election and poll; which said two petitions were by the house referred to a select committee of the house, which was duly ballotted for and appointed on Friday, the 3d of February, 1804, and continued from that day to sit on the trial of the same petitions until Monday the 9th of July last; and that, on the said 9th of July, the chairman of the said committee acquainted the house (among other things) that the committee had determined, that the said election and return for the said county of Middlesex were void, so far as respected the said sir F. Burdett; and that the committee had also come to the four following resolutions relative to the petitioners, viz. 1st. That on the 13th, 14th, and 15th days of the poll, on the first of which days there was a considerable majority of votes in favour of W. Mainwaring, esq. the sheriff R. A. Cox, esq. and sir W. Rawlins, knt. wilfully, knowingly, and corruptly, did admit to poll for Sir F. Burdett, bart. upwards of 300 persons claiming to vote under a fictitious right, as proprietors of a mill purported to be situated in the parish of Isleworth, and called the \"Good Intent Mill,\" by which means a colourable majority was obtained in favour of sir F. Burdett, 2d. That on the 15th day, towards the close of the poll, after such majority was established, they rejected persons tendering their votes under the same circumstances. 3d. That the sheriff at the poll acted in a judicial capacity, by admitting counsel to argue the validity of votes, and by deciding, in some instances, on the validity of such votes; that in other instances they refused to decide on the validity of votes which were objected to, and stated that they would admit any person to poll who would take the oaths, declaring themselves to be only ministerial officers, thereby acting in a manner contradictory to their practice in other cases, and in flagrant violation of their duty. 4th. That the obvious tendency of their conduct was to admit persons who had no right to poll, and to afford the greatest encouragement to perjury; and that the petitioners, being ignorant of the law, did, during the whole course of the said election, constantly and invariably act under the advice of their under-sheriffs and deputy under-sheriff, all of whom are attornies, highly respectable in their profession, and long conversant in the law, and one of them for above 20 years practised in the judicial decision of questions of the greatest value and importance; and136that on the 13th of the said last-mentioned election, when the proprietors of the mill, as mentioned in the above report of the said select committee of the house, first tendered themselves to vote, their right to vote at such election, for such freehold was argued very much at length by different counsel on each side; and alter such argument the petitioners did (by the advice of the aforesaid deputy under-sheriff, and one of the under-sheriffs, who were then and there present during the whole course of such argument, the other under-sheriff not being on the said 13th day in attendance) uniformly admit such of them to vote as stated themselves upon oath to have been 12 months in possession of shares of the value of 40s. a year, and did as uniformly reject such of them as appeared not to have been 12 months in possession, or not to have shares of that annual value, the petitioners acting therein in conformity to the advice aforesaid, and that the petitioners admitted the said last-mentioned persons to vote, from, a full and perfect conviction at the time of the legality of their claim, established in the minds of the petitioners by the repeated arguments of counsel, and the solemn oath of the parties; and they do conscientiously and sacredly declare, that, in the admission of those, as well as all other voters during the whole continuance of the aforesaid election, they acted with the most pure and upright intention, without partiality to one candidate, or prejudice against the other; and that the petitioners humbly state, that, though in particular instances they did heap questions argued by counsel, yet they did not consider themselves invested with a judicial authority, for the petitioners were instructed to conceive, and did and do. still conceive, that any freeholder, who tenders himself to take the respective oaths required by divers acts of parliament, to be taken at a county election, is entitled to have such oaths administered to him, and to vote thereat, and that such persons would be rejected at the peril of an action for damages, to be brought against the returning officers so rejecting them; nevertheless the petitioners confess that, in divers instances, they did take such peril upon themselves when the justice and equity of the case seemed, to warrant them in so proceeding, though not compellable by law so to do; and, in order to satisfy and protect themselves in the execution of this part of their office, they were frequently willing and de-137sirous to hear the arguments of counsel as a guide and assistance to the conduct of the petitioners, but not as a right to be claimed by either candidate; and that the petitioners further state, that they, in divers instances, as well relating to other tenements as to the mill tenement aforesaid, when it appeared to them, by the confession of the parties claiming a right to vote, that they had not been in possession of their freehold for 12 months, or that it was not of the annual value of 40s. did reject such persons; and the petitioners submit to this house that, from the aforesaid causes, they may seem sometimes to have acted ministerially, and at other times judicially, but at no time did they act from any interested or unworthy motives, but, on the contrary, from an anxious and earnest desire to do justice to all parties, though at the peril of an action against themselves; and the petitioners pursued this line of conduct equally in respect to voters tendering their votes for the aforesaid W. Mainwaring, esq. and sir F. Burdett, particularly in respect to very many persons claiming a right to vote by virtue of certain offices, some of which were held under the dean and chapter of Westminster, such as bell-ringers and butlers, organ-blowers and choiristers, cooks and gardeners, and who were admitted by the petitioners on the poll for the said W. Mainwaring, esq. and afterwards struck off such poll by the committee aforesaid; and that the petitioners humbly hope, since the greatest legal characters have differed concerning the nature of the duties, and power of a returning officer at an election of a knight to represent a county in parliament, that they shall not incur the censure of the house if, in the execution of their office, they sometimes appear to have been misled by contradictory arguments, which in the case of Ashby and White divided the opinions of the court of king's bench, where Lord Holt at that time presided as chief justice; and that those persons who, on the 15th day, claimed a right to vote for the mill tenement were rejected, because it appeared from their own confession, when the oath was tendered to them, that they had not been possessed of their freehold for the space of 12 months before the election, whereas those who were admitted on the 13th and 14th days, took the freeholder's oath, of the nature and effect of which they were solemnly warned and instructed at the time; and that the votes of the description above-138mentioned were not rejected on the 15th day, because sir. F. Burdett had then secured a majority of numbers on the poll, for the petitioners humbly state, that many of that description were rejected both in the early and latter part of that day, as well before as after such majority appears to have been obtained; and that the petitioners are informed that, at the election in July last of a knight of the shire in the room of sir F. Burdett, several of the proprietors of the said mill, called the Good Intent, tendered their votes, and that by the advice of Newman Knowlys, esq. barrister at law, and common serjeant of the city of London, who was assessor to the then sheriff, the then sheriff did not consider such proprietors to be fictitious voters, but did, after various arguments on each side, admit such of the said mill proprietors to poll who stated themselves upon oath to have been in possession 12 months of shares of the value of 40s. a year, and rejected others who had not been for that length of time in possession of such shares, or whose shares were not of that annual value, pursuing therein the same rule and line of conduct that the petitioners had adopted in the former election; and that the petitioners, with all humility, submit themselves to the sentence of the house, assured as they are that in its wisdom and its justice it will consider the arduous duty imposed on the petitioners as returning officers at the aforesaid election; and that no evidence whatever was, or has been, or could have been adduced, to shew any interested motive, personal or political, by which the petitioners were influenced in their conduct, and the petitioners solemnly declare, and are ready, if they might be permitted, to attest the same on oath, that, throughout the whole of such conduct, they never did in a single instance willfully transgress the line of their duty, but uniformly acted to the best of their knowledge, and that without favour or affection, prejudice or malice, towards any, person or party; and that the petitioners most humbly state to the house, that whatever may have appeared blameable in the execution of their office has arisen from the difficulty and novelty of their situation, and from their general ignorance of the law, which, however, they most anxiously endeavoured to correct (but are sorry to have found how unsuccessfully) by acting under the immediate judgment of professional persons, of great character and long ex-139perience; and that the petitioners are in formed, that the said report of the said select committee is ordered by the house to be taken into consideration on Tuesday, the 29th of Jan. inst. and therefore praying to be heard, by themselves, or by their counsel, at the bar of the house, and that the house will grant them such relief in the premises, as to its justice shall seem meet.\"&#x2014;Ordered, that the said petition do lie upon the table. A petition of the several persons, whose names are thereunto subscribed, was delivered in at the table, and read; setting forth, \"that the petitioners are freeholders of the county of Middlesex, and claim to have had a right to vote at the last election for that county; that at such election sir F. Burdett, bart. and G. B. Mainwaring, esq. were candidates to represent the said county in parliament; that upon a shew of hands the sheriff J. Shaw, esq. and sir W. Leighton, knt. declared the majority, on the view, to be in favour of sir P. Burdett, but a poll being duly demanded for the said election, the same was granted by the said sheriff, and commenced on the 23d of July, 1804; that the said poll continued open 011 the first day till about 5 o'clock in the evening; that on every other day during the continuance of the same, the poll was kept open 7 hours; that on divers days during such continuance, several persons attended at the booth, appointed according to law, to give their votes, and did accordingly declare their votes to be in favour of sir F. Burdett, whose names, places of abode, and freeholds, and in whose occupations their freeholds were, were duly entered on the poll, but the sheriff refused to permit the scratches or marks to be set opposite to their names, denoting the candidate for whom they voted, until their titles to vote had been examined into, although they offered to substantiate their titles by their oaths, nor would the sheriff allow such examination to take place at the booth, but insisted on their attending in a box, placed in a different part of the hustings, to undergo such examination; and although such persons, in compliance with such requisition, did accordingly attend at the said box, yet the consideration of many votes so-circumstanced, was adjourned, for want of time, till the days respectively succeeding, and thereby great delay and confusion arose; that in order to prevent the same in future, application was at sundry times, by the agents, friends, and140counsel of sir F. Burdett, made to the sheriff of the said county, to keep the poll; open longer than 7 hours, as by law he was bound to do when upon good and sufficient cause requested so to do; that the said sheriff, at the several times aforesaid, refused to accede to such application, that on the 14th and 15th days of the poll, the said sheriff, together with Newman Knowlys, esq. who then and there sat as assessor, or assistant to the said sheriff, severally, and at sundry times declared, that if at 3 o'clock on the said 15th day the votes of any persons that had been before that time objected to should not have been examined, the said sheriff would proceed upon such examination, and determine on the same after 3 o'clock on the same, or the following day; and the petitioners further state, that at 3 o'clock on the 15th day of the poll, several voters were in attendance at the sheriff's box, in obedience to orders given by the sheriff, waiting to be examined in respect to the titles to their votes, which had been previously entered on the poll, and their votes declared, some for the said G. B. Mainwaring, but many more for the said sir F. Burdett; and the petitioners humbly submit, that if the poll had been cast up at such hour, without any further examination of such voters, the names of such voters ought to have been reckoned, and thereby a majority of votes received on the poll declared, as in foot it was, in favour of sir F. Burdett; but the petitioners further state, that the poll was not cast up, nor the numbers declared, till the following day, and, in the mean time, the sheriff, in compliance with his aforesaid promise, proceeded to satisfy himself respecting the titles of the voters so previously entered on the poll, and, after such examination, directed marks to be set opposite to their names, some in favour of the said sip F. Burdett, and some for the said G. B. Mainwaring, according to the votes previously given for one or other of the said candidates; that a majority of the votes received on the poll did thereby also appear in favour of sir F. Burdett, and the said sir F. Burdett ought to have been returned to serve in this present parliament for the county aforesaid; and that the said sheriff, well knowing the premises, did, on the 16th day of the said election, illegally, wrongfully, wilfully, and falsely declare the majority of numbers to be in favour of the said G. B. Mainwaring, and illegally, wilt fully, wrongfully, and falsely, returned the141said G. B. Mainwaring to serve for the said county in the present parliament, although the said sir F. Burdett had a majority in number of votes received on the poll in his favour, and ought to have been returned in the stead and place of the said G. B. Mainwaring to serve in the present parliament for the county of Middlesex aforesaid; and therefore praying the house to order the said false return of the said sheriff to be amended, by directing the name of the said G. B. Mainwaring to be erased there from, and the name of the said sir F. Burdett to be inserted therein in the stead and place of the name of the said G. B. Mainwaring, and that the house will appoint an early day for taking their petition into consideration, and grant to the petitioners such further relief in the premises as to the house shall seem meet.\"&#x2014;Ordered, that the said petition be taken into consideration upon Tuesday, the 19th of Feb. next, and that Mr. Speaker do issue his warrant or warrants for such persons, papers, and records, as shall be thought necessary by the several parties on the hearing of the matter of the said petition.", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-mitford-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

{"date": ["1805", "feb", "05"], "content": "said, he felt it impossible to concur in the. grounds stated for the proposition of the right hon. gent, and equally impossible to accede to theres integraof the proceedings he recommended. A great deal of additional difficulty appeared to him to be thrown in the way of such concurrence by this consideration, that the house had already made an order that the parties accused should be heard at the bar. This order had been announced to those parties, in consequence of which they were in attendance, and prepared, no doubt, to produce farther evidence, perhaps of some persons who were out of the way, or were not known when the case was under the investigation of the committee. By such farther examination of evidence, the parties might expect to be able to lay before the house a more favourable view of their cause. After such an order, and such probable preparation in consequence, it appeared to him that it would be highly unjust to make a new order at the present moment. It would be, in fact, to say to the parties, \"although we have made an order that you should be heard at the bar to-day; although you may have taken great trouble to collect evidence to throw new light upon your case, and to repel the charges against, you, yet we have changed our mind, and you cannot be heard; we mean to re-consider the subject.\" Such would be the language of the house to the accused, should the proposition of the rt. hon. gent. be adopted. The practice referred to by the right hon. gent, which prevailed before the enactment of the Grenville bill, was not, he contended, analogous to the case under consideration, or to any case under that bill; for, in the former instance, it was to be recollected, that the committees upon election petitions were, though nominally select committees, accessible to all the members of the house; and therefore, every member might attend to examine and cross-examine the evidence. Of course, the report of such committees must be different, in the estimation of the house, from those of the committees under the Grenville act, which consisted but of a few members. In the one case, all the members of the house were competent to attend and investigate any part of the subject, while, in the other, only a few select persons were permitted to do so. This difference he the more dwelt on, in order to shew, that from the change which278had taken place in the jurisdiction upon election cases, the course formerly pursued was not fairly applicable at present. The right hon. gent, had endeavoured to support his proposition by resorting to the popular argument, which, in his opinion, could make no impression upon any candid, rational man; namely, that because the witnesses would not be on Oath at the bar, although they were so before the committee, that therefore we should have no examination of evidence whatever before the house. The question for consideration, was not whether the committee was more competent to investigate a charge against individuals, and to ascertain their guilt or innocence. Perhaps the court of King's Bench was still more competent to such an investigation. But that was not the point before the house. The question was this, whether, when executing the office of a criminal judicature, the house would act according to its own constitution, or to the principles of equity, if it proceeded to pronounce judgment without any examination of evidence as to the nature of the case upon which it was called on to judge? In declaring a negative to this question, he had little doubt of being supported by a full consideration of the practice of the house, and by the opinion of dispassionate men. The Grenville act, whatever other persons might think of it, or however it might be considered in other respects, had created an anomaly in the constitution of that house. By the course followed antecedent to that act, the whole matter of the election, as well with respect to the seat as to the conduct of the returning officers, and all collateral points, were referred to the committee; and the ultimate decision upon all these points still remained with the house, the report of the committee serving to guide its judgment. But, under the new arrangement, did the house commit to the committee the whole matter of the case? No; that committee was the dernier resort as to the seat only. Upon that their decision was, according to a legislative act, final and conclusive. But the seat was the only thing upon which the report of such committee was unalterable. As to any special report which it was authorized to make relative to the conduct of the returning officers,' the house retained the full power which, according to precedent, was uniformly; exercised, to proceed upon such special279report in the way which it was the object of the right hon. gent.'s motion to reverse. The Grenville act made as clear o distinction between the power vested in the committee, as to the decision of the seat, and that relative to a special report, as words could express. In the one case their power was absolute; in the other, it belonged to them only to report that there were other circumstances connected with the election, which required the interference of the house. Considering the report before the house in that view, he could not admit that it should have any other influence than that of calling attention to the proceedings of the accused, but by no means that of forming the ground for their conviction or punishment. All the precedents, since the Grenville act, upon similar cases, justified this opinion. But the right hon. gent, who proposed another course, thought proper entirely to overlook those precedents, and to look to the conduct formerly pursued under circumstances which he contended were not at all analogous. If the report of a committee under the new jurisdiction were to be binding on the house to adopt, in what a dilemma would the house be placed, suppose that an election committee on the Shoreham case, or that of Nottingham, had, in addition to the other particulars in their report, resolved that the right of election ought to be thrown open, that the electors should be increased. Would not the admission of such an authority, in the report of a committee, as he had alluded to, be, in effect, to delegate to such committee the legislative power of the house? Yet, such an inference would naturally follow from the arguments used by the right hon. gent. If, then, that argument, or the proposition that followed, could not be sustained by reason, the constitution of the house, or precedent, he thought that justice would urge the adoption of such line of proceeding as might be most favourable to the interest of the accused, and that, obviously, was to allow them to bring forward any farther evidence that it might be in their power to produce for their exculpation. Any different course would, he was quite persuaded, be felt as inconsistent with the ends of substantial justice, as it would be with the spirit of our law. That law uniformly said, that a man accused of any offence should be fully heard before sentence should be pro-280nounced; and that law very properly allowed, that if any circumstances could be discovered, to alter the nature of the charge, and to establish the innocence of the accused up to the moment before the time fixed for the infliction of punishment, the sentence should be reversed. Here, however, it was proposed to deviate entirely from that laudable and salutary mode of proceeding. Since the investigation of this case before the committee, circumstances had occurred which, without meaning any reflection whatever on the judgment, principles, or character of the gent, who composed that commit: tee, would, he was persuaded, prevent them at the present day from pronouncing as a jury that verdict which appeared in the report on the table. Was it not, then, but fair to allow these circumstances to be laid before the house by evidence at the bar? It would be unjust towards the house, and it would be cruel towards the parties accused, to exclude such evidence. If a criminal were convicted of the most heinous offence, that power in whom the right of pardon is constitutionally vested, would not hesitate even the moment before the appointed execution of sentence, to remit that sentence, and pardon the accused, should any facts arise to prove his innocence. This example should be attended to in the case under consideration, and should urge the house to afford to the accused every opportunity of exculpation, before it attempted to pronounce judgment. This was not only the opinion which he entertained, but that which was sanctioned by all former proceedings in similar cases. In the Shoreham case, which the noble lord chose as the precedent to follow, with one exception only, in this instance, he recollected some debate, and a division also, the result of which was, a determination opposed only by a very small minority, that those accused should be heard fully by evidence, and by counsel at the bar. Such was the mode that justice, law, and precedent suggested to the house on the present occasion; and he felt the character of the house, and of public equity, to be so much concerned, that he could not help resisting the introduction of a different practice. The evidence which appeared in the report might have been taken in a loose way, or it might be imperfect, and a farther examination at the bar might elucidate many, important facts. This was not at all im-281possible, notwithstanding the close scrutiny said to have, taken place before the committee, and the known accuracy of the council employed, whose ability no man mole highly respected than he did, and upon even the possibility of such elucidation, he would have the parties allowed a farther hearing. Those parties he bad heard it intimated, were willing to acquiesce in the refusal of any farther examination of evidence; of this he knew nothing positively, but even if it were so, it would effect no change in the opinion he entertained. However, if upon appearing at the bar they admitted the evidence as it stood in the, report, their admission must of course be received; but in no other way-could he notice, that admission, because it was not more his object to render perfect justice to the accused, in this instance, than to guard against the establishment of a precedent that was likely to lead to great injustice towards others.&#x2014;The hon. member concluded, with observing, that under all the circumstances of the case, particularly after having appointed a hearing at the bar on this day, and ordered the attendance of the parties accordingly, it would be one of the harshest proceedings imaginable to reverse that order now, and strike into a new and opposite course.", "author_id": "/people/mr-charles-fox-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

There was a principle, however, laid down by the learned gent, that if the returning officer should not happen to be present at the committee who might report against his conduct, there would then be ground for hearing such evidence at the bar as such officer might feel it necessary to bring forward for his exculpation. If so, then the course proposed by the learned gent.'s right hon. friend was inadmissible. For it always would be necessary to establish a preliminary inquiry, according to the learned gent.'s principle, to ascertain whether the returning officer was present at the committee before the house proceeded to pronounce judgment upon him; and in point of strict justice, this inquiry should also go to this point, whether the returning officer was present throughout, or whether his defence was not perfected before the committee had made their report. In the case before the house, he could say that the defence of the accused was not perfected, because the counsel for the accused did not conceive it necessary to sum up, and remark upon the evidence. Such was that learned gent.'s reliance on the285strength of his clients. To supply that omission was one reason why it' was the' wish of the accused to be heard at the bar, and he could state that those gentlemen would feel themselves hardly treated, if they were refused that hearing.

{"date": ["1805", "feb", "05"], "content": "pursuant to his notice on a former day, rose to move for the production of certain papers, calculated to enable the house to judge of a charge made in a report of the navy board, on the subject of certain very large charges for the repairs of the ships Romney and La Sensible, while under the command of sir Home Popham, in the Red Sea. On a subject of such importance, he thought it incumbent on him, both consistently with his duty to the house, and in fairness to the hon. and gallant officer whose conduct was implicated, to state a few of the circumstances which induced him to institute an inquiry into the grounds of this charge. He hoped the house would do him the justice to believe that he had not taken up the subject on light grounds, or from hasty conclusions. It was not the rumours on this business, which had long met the public ear; it was not till he had, for several months, seen a publication containing the most serious charges against the hon. officer, and observed, that this publication remained unanswered, that he had felt himself called upon no longer to postpone the consideration of a subject, in which, not only the262character of the Brit, navy, but the whole system of economy in the public expenditure, were intimately involved. Indeed, it was the less necessary for him to offer any apology on the present occasion, for while he was confident the house would never shew themselves deficient in a desire to uphold the honour of our brave defenders, they would evince a determination not less firm, that no officer, however high his character, or extensive his merits, should be suffered to waste the public money intrusted to his care, with unnecessary and ruinous prodigality. The house had shewn a disposition to act on such principles, in the appointment of the commission to inquire into naval abuses, and, he trusted, the same ideas would continue to regulate their deliberations. It would, surely, not be disputed that the whole duty of a British officer was not confined to his mere conduct in the hour of battle. He would never forget that he had other, and not less important offices to perform, in watching over the distribution of the national resources committed to his care, and that all accounts were to be passed from the validity of his assurances that no idle or unnecessary expenditure had occurred. Having made these general observations, the hon. gent. proceeded to the immediate subject on which he had risen to address the house. It would be recollected, that about the end of the year 1800, the Romney and La Sensible were fitted out for the purpose of co-operating in the expedition to Egypt, which took place in the spring of the subsequent year, and were then under the command of sir Home Popham. About May 1803, as nearly as he could recollect, these ships returned to this country. Previous to this period, bills from India had reached the admiralty, to the amount of no less than-80,000l.for the repair of these vessels. The admiralty board were naturally astonished at so enormous a charge, and they accordingly instructed the commissioners of the navy board to examine into all the stores and repairs which these vessels had received fom the time of their departure from England, and to call for the several journals in, which accounts of the expenditure had been preserved. On the tone and character of the report made by these commissioners, he had been principally inclined to rest his arguments to the house for the production of the papers, with motions for which he meant to conclude. At the time the Rom-263ney sailed, she was stated to be completely provided with stores, of all sorts, for 12 months. Yet, as soon as she reached the Cape of Good Hope, which was before the expiration of 3 months, it was found that fresh supplies of stores were obtained; and, in the course of the months of Nov. and Dec. other supplies, to the amount of 4,000l.were charged to the public. This was, surely, a very extraordinary charge, but it was one contained in the report of the commissioners of the navy board, and, consequently, worthy of the utmost attention.&#x2014;The next point to which he wished to direct the attention of the house, was the comparative statement of the journal of the captain, and the several other journals, of the expenditure which had come under the inspection of the commissioners. On this part of the subject it was impossible for him to go into any technical details; but it would be sufficient to refer generally to the tone and temper of the report, the language of which clearly imported that the journals were both irregular and in many instances contradictory. In the report it was distinctly stated, that articles for the use of the Romney and La Sensible had been purchased at a most enormous rate, and that other articles, on the contrary, had not been accounted for in a satisfactory manner, or rather had been disposed of at less than the 20th part of their real value. Among the charges was one for a 50-hundred-weight anchor, purchased in the room of one which had been lost in the Indian seas. Here, however, a remarkable circumstance occurred, that when the inquiry was instituted at Sheerness as to the state of the Romney, it was stated that when she sailed from England she had the identical anchor which was found on board after her return. While this was mentioned, it did not at all appear that the other anchor, in room of which the 50-hundred-weight anchor was purchased, had ever been lost, or if it was lost, that it had ever been recovered. Even if all the extra expences were to be admitted, there would remain four or five thousand pounds, for which no sort of account is to be discovered in the journals of the boatswain, or elsewhere. It was asserted that the Romney, when she left England, was fully provided for 12 months with all requisite stores. But after the most minute enquiries, the commissioners had found, that in a very short time after her sailing-she had received repairs, and264that nearly 9,000l.had been charged the these repairs; 7,800l.of which they considered as excess of charge, on an accurate examination. Surely in this there was very little of the appearance of economy, and k was fit, at such a period as he present, that the business should be fully investigated. The commissioners had stated the charges to be enormous, and it was proper that the grounds of their decision should be stated. With respect to the charges on the repairs of the Sensible, the same opinion as to extravagance was delivered, and the same necessity for full investigation existed. Whether the hon. officer at the time the supposed repairs were made, was under the orders of adm. Rainier, or whether, as he had heard it insinuated, he had an independent command, he confessed himself unable to decide. If he was under the orders of adm. Rainier, it certainly must be allowed to have been a most extraordinary circumstance, that the superior officer had not been consulted on a step which was surely one of very great consequence, and necessarily attended with vast expence. The step to which he alluded was the changing of the Sensible into a 32 gun frigate. The hon. officer might have had grounds for this alteration, but it could not be pretended that he had communicated his reasons to the adm. on the East India station. On the contrary it appeared, that a month previous to the arrival of the ship at Calcutta, the cordage, rigging, and other articles necessary to form the alteration, had been ordered and were in a state of preparation. Thus, it appeared that the hon. officer had taken the whole responsibility of the business on himself, and it was proper that the grounds on which he proceeded should be explained. It was stated that before the Sensible had been altered, her situation had been fully examined, but what he had just stated respecting the orders for stores, completely refuted this idea. There were other accounts of transactions in the Red Sea which were not a little curious. The hon. officer seemed to have found, contrary to general opinion, every thing quite as convenient for the repair of ships as if he had actually been in the heart of the river, and in the vicinity of our arsenals. It was proper that the public should understand the whole of these transactions, which were necessary to complete the view of the subject. Connected with this part of265the question, he should also take the liberty of moving for certain letters from marquis Wellesley relative to the expenditure of the vessels under the command of the hon. officer while in the Indian seas. Before he sat down, he wished to say a few words as to the mode of investigation which he had thought it his duty to propose. It might be asked, whether this was the only possible mode of investigating the subject; whether there was not another tribunal, before which the merits of the question might not be more satisfactorily decided? It might be urged that this was a matter which the board of admiralty were much more competent to try, than an assembly composed as that which he had the honour to address. To this his answer was plain and satisfactory. He had heard, on authority which to him appeared highly respectable, that the late board of admiralty had designed to institute a criminal prosecution against the hon. officer. The change of administration, however, by which the late \"weak and inefficient\" board of admiralty was changed for a \"capable and efficient\" one, had prevented them from carrying their views into effect, and there was no prospect of the present board of admiralty following up the resolution of their predecessors. When he saw the hon. officer not only invested with an important command, but apparently high in the confidence of his maj,'s ministers, he thought it was not at all unnatural to suppose, that no sort of proceeding respecting the hon. officer's conduct was in contemplation. It might be said again, that this subject would, with much more propriety, have been submitted to the consideration of the commission appointed to inquire into naval abuses. For his part, he should have felt pride and satisfaction in having the merits of the question tried before that board. Never, he believed, did any men, invested with great powers, discharge their duly to the house and the public with more zeal, and more fidelity. But as it was understood that this board had it not in their power to take cognizance of the business, he had felt it his duty to submit it to the consideration of the highest tribunal in the country. He lamented deeply the painful nature of the duty he had this night attempted to perform. If the charges which appeared in the report of the late board against the hon. officer could not be supported, he should rejoice in having afforded him an opportunity of establish-266ing his character, and refuting ill-founded charges, and public calumny. He should hope, likewise, that the house would do him justice, and give him credit for the integrity of his intention, in arraigning the conduct of the hon. officer, who, if guilty, should be made to feel, that he was employed not only to fight in the cause of his country, but also to be the steward, in his department, of the public purse. The hon. gent, concluded, with moving, \"that there be laid before the house; 1, An account of the repairs of the Romney; 2, A copy of the report of the navy board, of the 20th Feb. 1804, respecting the repairs of the Romney and Sensible, and the expenditure and supplying of stores on board of those ships while under the command of sir Home Popham, together with its enclosures; 3, Copies of the letters of marquis Wellesley, respecting the above accounts, transmitted to the directors of the East India Company.\" As soon as the first motion was put from the chair,", "author_id": "/people/mr-charles-kinnaird", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

The hon. member had expressed his surprise, that no answer had been given to that pamphlet. He begged leave to assure the hon. gent. and the house, that this had arisen from no backwardness on his part, to meet the scandalous falsehoods which that pamphlet contained. The fact, however, was, that a certain degree of caution and alarm in the press had retarded the publication of his answer; which now, however, was before the public. From this answer, he begged leave to read a few extracts of letters which had passed between him and the board of admiralty, from which it would be clear beyond all possibility of doubt, that he had on every occasion evinced the most ardent desire, not only to throw no obstacles in the way of the investigation of the charges; but had, on the contrary, pressed upon the board of admiralty, every consideration which seemed to him in the least calculated to accelerate the discussion. In support of this observation, the hon. offi-267cer proceeded to read an extract from a letter to Lord St. Vincent, as first lord of the admiralty, in June, 1803, in which he alludes to the gross and unfounded charges made against him, and solicits their lordships to lose no time in ordering a strict investigation of his conduct. To this letter he received an answer, that the business should be referred to the commissioners of the navy board, and as soon as they had prepared a report on the subject, a copy should be furnished him. The hon. officer, still anxious to accelerate the investigation, wrote, on the 5th July, another letter, representing the propriety of his being called before the navy board, to afford such explanations as would materially facilitate a final decision. The whole of his correspondence with the admiralty had, he maintained, this dispatch in the investigation as the object dearest to his heart. It could not be at all contended, therefore, that if the matter was not fully investigated, any blame was to be attached to him in the business. Indeed, from a review of the whole of his conduct, he had no reason to shrink from enquiry. He was confident, that on every occasion, and during the whole of the service on which the charge was founded, he had never looked to private interest, but to the interest and the glory of his country. He had ample testimonies of the discipline, the healthiness, and the sailor-like apperance of the crew of the Romney while under his command, and he consoled himself, amidst malignant and unfounded charges, by the reflection that he had been fortunate enough to receive the good opinion of the most respectable men in the honorable profession to which he belonged. He was never conscious of having given an order for a single article which did not seem to him necessary to the public service. On the 26th of July, he wrote to sir Evan Nepean, in consequence of the laying his papers before the commissioners, repeating his solicitations to give his personal attendance on the enquiries, as the most expeditious mode possible for the object in view, and the only way of accelerating a decision. To this he received no answer: and, oh the 3d of Aug. he wrote to the navy board on the same subject, and requesting to have the question put, which he had put at Chatham: \"Whether, if the Romney had not received the repairs in question, considering the weather she experienced, she would not, in all probability, have268gone to the bottom?\"&#x2014;The hon. officer then observed, that his ship was in such a state, that a few days after his pennant was down, it was commissioned&#x2014;an unprecedented occurrence. The hon. bart then explained what had passed at Calcutta, in the repairs of the different vessels under his command, none of which had been adverted to by the hon. gent. except the Romney, nor by the anonymous publication from which he had taken all his information. Here he could not omit to notice, that the anonymous publication had made no slight impression on certain gallant officers in the navy. In proof of this, the hon. bart. read an affidavit that had been volutarily made by a gent. who had been out with him as 3d, then as 2d lieut. and had afterwards been made commander by Lord St. Vincent. The gent. he adverted to was Francis Mason, Esq. commander of his maj.'s ship Rattler; and as that gent. was indebted wholly for his promotion to Lord St. Vincent, his voluntary and unsolicited testimony would have some weight with the house. The affidavit had been made before the mayor of Portsmouth on the 5th of Jan. 1805, subsequent to the appearance of the pamphlet, but before the notice of the hon. gent.'s motion. The tenor of the affidavit was highly complimentary to the hon. bart. It stated \"that he saw no undue waste of stores; that the conduct of sir Home Popham was that of a strict disciplinarian, and that he was incapable of doing any thing contrary to honour and integrity, and the good of the service; that his attention to the sick was exemplary; that they had in the Red Sea only one scorbutic, and one liver case; that the country boats were absolutely necessary, and that by them they saved the lives of 400 persons, soldiers and sailors, in the Red Sea; that a cable was cut in Balasore Road, at the recommendation of the pilot, in order to enter Diamond Harbour, with several other particulars, highly to the credit and honour of the character of sir Home Popham.\" Similar testimony in his favour the hon. officer read from the letter of a respectable gent. in India, in which he attributes the safety of the Calcutta transport in the Red Sea, to the exertions of sir Home Popham, his officers and crew.&#x2014;He insisted on the circumstance of no attempt being made to bring him to punishment, as a strong proof of his innocence. If the board of admiralty thought they had a case269made out against him, why did they not bring him to a court martial? That they were not unwilling to do so, can scarcely be denied; and their having taken no steps in the business, was a pretty good proof that they were convinced that any attempt to substantiate any charge against him would prove abortive. No less than IS months after his return elapsed before any report was formed, and now that the report was before the public nearly a year, no steps had been taken to follow up the charges. He was happy that the subject was now brought forward, and he trusted there would not be a dissenting voice in agreeing to the production of all the papers for which the hon. gent. had moved. He was anxious to have no information held back, and he was highly gratified to think that he should now have an opportunity of vindicating his conduct before so high a tribunal. Before he sat down, the hon. officer animadverted on the last sentence of the report of the commissioners of the navy board. It was there admitted by the commissioners that they had conducted the investigation in an unusual manner, that they had framed their report without hearing sir Home Popham as to any of the grounds of charge, but that in following this course they thought they acted in conformity to the wishes of the lords commissioners of the admiralty.", "author_id": "/people/sir-home-popham", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

It was natural to suppose that when such heavy accusations were brought forward against the hon. officer, he would have entered into some justification of his conduct. The hon. officer had hinted that he ought to have been called before the navy board for that purpose. Such was not the regular mode of procedure. The accounts of all naval officers are sent to the navy board, there examined, and, if found to be incorrect, the pay of such officers is stopped, but they are not themselves summoned to give an explanation of their conduct. The hon. officer had expressed his surprise, that after his return to England, and during the period in which the late admiralty board continued in office, this report had been suffered to lie dormant, and no proceedings whatever instituted upon it. He would inform the house of the reason. In the first instance, the admiralty conceived the idea of instituting a criminal prosecution; they then270doubted their power to do this, and determined to refer it to the court of exchequer. That the affair might be fully investigated, various reports were waited for, which had not been received when the late admiralty went out of office. An hon. gent, whom he had in his eye, (Mr. Dickenson, jun.) could probably inform the house, whether these reports had yet arrived. If they had, he took it for granted that the proceedings would be continued. The hon. officer had spoken confidently of his ability to justify himself. He could only tell him, that he believed that the board of admiralty could have justified itself much more readily; yet he would say, that if the hon. officer should be able to justify himself to the satisfaction of the house, and of the country, it would afford him very great pleasure. As to what had been said of the \"scurrility\" of a certain pamphlet, it was most certain that he had read the pamphlet; but there did not appear to him all that scurrility which was imputed to it. Nay, what was called scurrilous, was, in point of fact, nothing but the report of the navy board.

He complained severely of the reluctance of the navy board to give him up the papers necessary for completing his defence, even after he had received assurances from the secretary of the admiralty that orders for that purpose had been specially delivered. He had been informed in April that the papers were nearly ready for delivery. He had made repeated applications, till Aug. when he was given to understand that the papers were lost. Thus, after waiting 4 or 5 months, he had been scandalously tantalized and disappointed. He inveighed with great severity on such unfair and illiberal treatment of the report. As an instance of the jealousy, or worse, of the late admiralty, the hon. officer next stated to the house, that when at Sheerness, for the purpose of refitting, every delay had been interposed, and the most vexatious obstacles thrown in his way, until at length the object was in danger of never being accomplished, &#x2014;There was another subject on which he felt peculiar pain. It was not enough to have traduced him in a pamphlet, in which hot one fact appeared that was not scandalously perverted, but that pamphlet must be circulated with an industry unparalleled, and even sent to the officers under his command: for when on a late service on the enemy's coast, he found that that pamphlet had been sent by post to the officers under his command. On a proceeding like this, which obviously tended to remove all confidence in a commander, he need make no observations. Was it patriotism? Was it public virtue? Ridicule, too, was at the same time attempted to be thrown upon him, because he had been, as his enemies had pleased to term it, a leader of catamarans, a mode of attack, which in common with other officers, he had suggested to the present naval administration. He begged leave to remark on the way in which the notice for the motion now before the house had been given. He was in command of a274ship now at Gravesend; it was occasionally necessary for him to go down to that place; and a day on which he was absent was selected for the purpose of giving the notice.

His ldp. said, that in laying the different papers and documents before their ldps. from time to time, he had been guided by a sincere and anxious wish to have that house as fully and completely informed upon the subject, in every respect, as the other house of parliament. He wished to call the attention of the house to this point, merely with a view to impress their ldps. with the conviction that whatever difference of opinion might possibly exist as to the subject in general, or any of its parts, there existed no desire, on the part of his maj.'s ministers in that house, to conceal or withhold any information whatever, which it was safe or practicable to lay before parliament. With respect to the general subject which they were about to consider, he was fully sensible of its importance and magnitude, and he trusted it would fully appear, on due enquiry and investigation, that the state in which this country is now placed, with respect to Spain, was not in the smallest degree desired, sought for, or still less provoked by any conduct on the part of his maj.'s govt.339One of the first considerations which naturally presented itself, in viewing the question, and one upon which much of its merits depended, was the stipulations of the treaty between France and Spain, concluded at St. Ildefonso, On this document, great stress was naturally kid, and, in appreciating its merits, comparisons were entered into between it and the treaty concluded between the French and Spanish branches of the house of Bourbon, in 1761, known by the appellation of the Family Compact. However, he thought the fair result of a comparison between these treaties would be very different from certain con elusions which had been drawn. The Family Compact paid due regard to that general principle of the law of nations, which dictates a relative equal stipulation between the parties; a treaty constituted otherwise, one wherein the stronger power dictates to the weaker, militates against the law of nations; it goes to deprive the weaker power of its sovereignty, and identifies it at once with the more powerful party. His Idp. then recapitulated some of the leading stipulations of the treaties adverted to, and contended, that in the family compact, the relative power and the resources of Spain were duly attended to, while, in that of St. Ildefonso, a very different ratio was observed, even to the exaction of the whole force of the country, though the object of the war should not respect the interests of the nation required. Such a treaty of alliance prevailed between France and Spain at the time of the rupture between G. Britain and the former, and in considering the question between her and the latter, that circumstance was of material importance. With respect to this, as well as to every other part of the subject, their ldps, may see, from a reference to the documents before them, that the most anxious desire existed with his maj.'s govt. to preserve the relations of peace with Spain, and this was uniformly, as appeared by the instructions transmitted from time to time to Mr. l there, the case, whatever changes might have taken place in his maj.'s councils, until, from the conduct of the Spanish govt. a state of war became unavoidable. In endeavouring to this effect, it was deemed proper to ascertain the impressions which the treaty of St. Ildefonso had made, und how far the Spanish govt. felt itself obliged to adhere to the letter of its stipulations, if called upon. Accordingly, instructions in that340spirit were sent to the British minister at Madrid, who was, however, impressed with the like considerations, and had, previously to their arrival, acted upon them. His ldp. here made frequent references to the relevant parts of the documents, particularly to the results of Mr. Frere's various conferences with the prince of peace (the real governor of that country) upon the subject. He considered the answers given by the prince on the occasion, as perplexing and inconclusive; notwithstanding the conduct of the govt. of this country was, as upon a former occasion, equally moderate and dignified; every thing was done to avoid the extremity of war, which could be effected consistently with the honour, the interests, and safety of this country.&#x2014;The next prominent consideration, to which the noble sec. of state adverted, arose from the proposal on the part of France, to march a large body of troops through Spain, the remonstrance against which, equally spirited and moderate, appeared to be attended with some effect. With regard to the important considerations of the naval armaments, and the sale of prizes, the conduct of the Brit, govt. guided by the same spirit, was equally moderate and firm. With respect to the required contingent of furnishing the stipulated number of ships of the line, the forbearance of the British govt. was, under the existing circumstances, far more moderate than it otherwise might be, as the French govt. were occupied almost solely with a particular project against this country, viz. its invasion by means of flotillas, Sic, Another light in which our forbearance at the time was to be viewed, was the. interest and security of our ancient ally Portugal; we warded off the danger from that quarter, as long as it was practicable. In considering this part of the subject, the noble sec. made frequent references to the progress of the negotiation; the spirit and perseverance of the Brit. govt. blended at the same time with a due degree of moderation and forbearance, appeared to be the cause of substituting a pecuniary supply for the contingent stipulated by the treaty. The diplomatic transactions with the Spanish govt. then wore a different complexion; it became expedient to as certain the amount of the proposed subsidies, and a comparative calculation thereof, with the probable expences of the contingent, if furnished in kind; this was entered into by his ldp. for the informa-341tion of the house, as well as a detail of that part of the correspondence, He adverted to the perseverance of the British govt. in their system of moderation and forbearance, with respect to this part of the transactions, which was manifested by its acquiescence in the payment of the subsidy, so-long as it could be considered as a temporary measure. The comparative calculations to which he referred, were necessary to refute the assertions of the Spanish govt. that the subsidy was less advantageous to France than would be the furnishing the contingent. His statements were drawn chiefly from what had been estimated as the value in contingent of a given number of ships of the line, and number of troops, as laid down in former treaties of contribution. He particularly recurred to that between G. Britain and Holland in 1788, the result of which was, that, with respect to the infantry, the calculation was at 10l.per man. An amount, referred to in the treaty of subsidy in question would cover a considerably greater number of troops than Spain possibly could supply; and, in point of fact, more than 8 times an equivalent for the number of men stipulated for in the treaty with France. Still, the system of forbearance was adhered to on the part of G. Britain. However, when the restless ambition, and domineering influence of France was considered, it became important to the British govt. not to relax in point of vigilance. This was the more necessary, as French soldiers were at the time clandestinely allowed to march through Spain, and the armaments were, to a certain extent, yet going on. At length strong remonstrances were made; and the impossibility of the British minister continuing longer at Madrid, were the naval armaments not completely stopped, was held out. In explaining this part of the transaction, several references were made to the documents, and the justifiable conduct of the Brit govt. and its minister contended for by his ldp. During these transactions, Spain might be fairly regarded as in a state of suspended hostility, and with respect to the sale of the prizes, the conduct of the Brit govt. was borne out, were it necessary to defend it by precedents or arguments drawn from analogy, by the case which occurred in America, during the diplomatic residence of Mr. Hammond. His ldp. proceeded, by a detailed exposition of the case, to refute the allegation of342the Spanish minister, that by concealing the affair of the prizes, they had considerably injured their colonial interests. Throughout the whole of this, transaction, which may in some point of view be regarded as a war of piracy, the overbearing influence of France was manifest; the firmness and moderation of the Brit, govt. were, notwithstanding, attended with effect, and the French ambassador, considering that this war of piracy benefitted only the subjects of his country, permitted M, Cevallos to concede the point.&#x2014;His ldp. repeated the observation, that the Brit. govt. were determined to persevere in their system of forbearance and moderation, as long as it could consistently or safely be done; at the same time, their vigilance and precautionary system were not suffered to relax a moment. In this spirit was the dispatch of Ld. Harrowby to Mr. Frere, wherein he instructs him to ascertain, as far as possible, the real state of the armaments in the different naval depots in Spain, as well as subsequent documents to which he particularly referred, and which evinced, not only the vigilance, but the anxiety of the British govt. to preserve the relations of amity with Spain. He pointed out the evasive conduct of the Spanish govt. particularly the allegation of M. d'Anduaga with respect to the destination of the armaments at Ferrol, namely, that they were to suppress an insurrection which had broken out in Biscay; this assertion was alledged to be made on the information conveyed by an officer, whose regiment was among the troops ordered for that purpose. But, he would ask, was such a communication to be deemed authoritative or satisfactory under the circumstances of the case? Certainly not! It was more rational to suppose other objects were in view. Nothing which sound and vigorous policy dictated was left undone by the Brit, govt. The Spanish ministers were repeatedly called upon explicitly to declare the nature and extent of their engagements with France; and at the same time, they were required to reduce their naval armaments to the state they were in at the commencement of the hostilities between G. Brit, and France. This proposition was spiritedly urged by the British blockading officer, who said, \"unship your guns, and it will be considered as disarming; your lying a little farther in the road is no disarming at all.\" No satisfactory answer could be obtained343on this head. They deemed it not prudent to declare the real state of their engagements with France, and they did not dare, bona fide, to disown that the influence of the French ambassador, Bournonville, preponderated; and it was not too much to advance, that the whole was temporizing, until the arrival of their treasure. Under such circumstances, in which a system of delay and evasion on the part of Spain was apparent, G. Brit, was forced to depart from that system which, while moderation was safe, or forbearance honourable, she had scrupulously adhered to. He hoped and trusted, that the opinion which was already marked as that of the country, with respect to these transactions, would be felt in that house. He hoped and he believed, that his noble friends opposite to him were incapable of proceeding upon a false ground of opposition that night, on a question which involved the interests and the honour of their country. He trusted these grounds of opposition, if such was determined on, would be on the merits alone of the transactions themselves. There was one circumstance which he should not think it necessary at all to mention, as making no part whatever of the case, had it not been touched upon by a noble friend of his on a former night; he meant the detention of the frigates, respecting which he conceived it impossible, informed as their lordships were, to have the least dispute. They alt knew that transaction was entirely unconnected with the cause of the war; it made no part whatever of the discussion, and was not even known at Madrid, until the Brit. minister had quitted that capital. The transaction, he hesitated not to aver, was, by the law of nations, by arguments drawn from analogy, or on grounds of obvious expediency, completely justifiable. And farther, the previous relative situation of the country would have called for the proceeding. The case of 1761 afforded a parallel, but with this difference in favour of the present instance; in 176l, the whole year's treasure was in the ports of Spain: the war is now begun with the treasures of Spain at the disposal of G. Britain; and, in proof that the measure alluded to was not made a ground for the war, his ldp. made some further references to the documents. Drawing towards a conclusion, his ldp. contended, that no nation ever was placed in a state of war with such complete and accurate grounds of moderation and forbearance to344rest upon, as this country in the present instance. No proof of aggression, or ill will, could be advanced against us. Every nerve was strained by his maj.'s govt. to avert the dreadful alternative of war, and the evil day was kept off as long as possible: that nothing had been done, which could not be justified by the right the country had to defend itself was perfectly evident: he called on the house for its support. He was compelled by a sense of his duty to his country, and a perfect reliance on the justice of her cause, and on which was grounded his confidence that their lordships would unanimously concur in the address he should have the honour to propose. The noble secretary then moved an address to his maj. corresponding with, the relevant paragraph of his maj.'s speech, applauding the wisdom and justice of the measures of his maj.'s govt. in the recent transactions with Spain, and more especially that system of moderation and forbearance which characterised the whole, which was persevered in as long as the same could be done consistently with a just regard to the honour of his maj.'s crown, and the interest and welfare of his subjects, and promising the cordial support of their ldps.

His lordship said, he saw the matter in a light so extremely different, in almost every particular, from the noble lord who had just sat down, that he should ill discharge his duty to his sovereign and the country, did he not state some of his reasons of dissent from the address which had just been moved. Without any prefatory observations on the subject, he trusted that noble lords would believe that he would be one of the last men in that house, for the mere sake of opposition to a minister, to do any thing which could at all cast discredit on the govt. where the character of the country was so intimately concerned in the discussion. He felt, however, that he should in this case be committing the, honour and dignity of the country, were he to abstain from delivering the sentiments which occurred to him, on a fair, dispassionate, and careful examination of the materials on the table. In doing so, what appeared to him as being the most regular and parliamentary course would be to move an amendment, He could not propose to negative the address moved; by the noble lord. Having such materials; before them as were now lying on the345table of that house, such a line of conduct would indeed be improper. They could alone discharge their duty by laying their sentiments on this important subject before his majesty. In the first place, he felt no hesitation in saying, he most cordially acquiesced in that part of his maj.'s declaration which states, that from the first moment of the commencement of hostilities between this country arid France, justifiable grounds existed for our going to war with Spain also. On that subject he presumed to think there could not be two opinions. But if govt. thought proper to wave that right, and to enter into negotiations how far they would allow Spain to fulfil, and how far they would not allow her to fulfil her treaty with France; if they thought it prudent to wink at her supplying the enemies of this country to a certain extent, they ought clearly and explicitly to have intimated to what extent that, supply was to be countenanced, what were the specific terms of neutrality they would submit to, and none other. If they had done so, and if their conduct had been actuated by that moderation and humanity which the noble lord had stated, he should have agreed in the propriety of their conduct, he should have rejoiced that they had made every becoming effort to preserve peace. But was this really the case? Had the conduct of our govt. been characterized by humanity and moderation? All he had read on the subject, in the voluminous bodies of papers on the table, led him to form a very different opinion. He had seen nothing of firmness or consistency, nothing of moderation or humanity; their conduct was altogether made up of inanity and indecision. He should notice a few particulars, from which he was induced to draw this conclusion, and to regret, that in many respects, duplicity and want of candour had distinguished the instructions of ministers to our ambassador at Madrid, more than open and ingenuous conduct, which ought to distinguish a great nation. Mr. Frere was desired, in his instructions from govt. to get every explanation from the Spanish minister he could, but himself to give no information. The Spanish ministers, therefore, justly complained, that they did not know what he wanted. In one place he is desired to state, that the granting of pecuniary succours will be esteemed a sufficient ground of war; and immediately afterwards he is instructed to require infor-346mation on certain other points before he, gives any answer on that subject. Mr. Frere's own conduct shewed that he did not know what his instructions meant. Indeed they were so various and contradictory in themselves, that he could hardly be supposed to be able to reconcile them. There was, besides, a want of vigour and attention on the part of govt. which was truly astonishing, and was unquestionably reprehensible in the highest degree. There, appeared in the communication from ministers in this country to Mr. Frere, a chasm, at one period, from the 22d June to the 24th Nov.; again, one to a smaller extent, being from the 2d Nov. to the middle of Jan.; and a still more remarkable one from the 21st of Jan. to the 29th Sept. being a period of upwards of eight months, during which a new and important discussion was going on; one in which from its delicate nature, as embracing the alternative of peace or war, the honour and character of the country were concerned; but in which not a single line of instructions was sent from the govt. of this country to the person at Madrid, who was carrying on this important negotiation.&#x2014; The detention of the Spanish treasure ships, was also an instance of the mild measures of hostilities, adopted by the British govt. It had been attempted, but most unjustly, to assimilate it to an embargo laid oil in a port. To such a measure it had not the most distant resemblance; and before our govt. resorted to such a step it was called on by every principle of candour and good faith, and by every sentiment of honour and propriety, to give the Spanish govt. intimation that if it did not receive every information required, it was its determination to adopt a step of the kind. It was said that Mr. Frere had left Madrid before the news of their capture or detention was known there. But what did that avail? Could that circumstance render their detention lawful f Mr. Frere had never intimated to the Spanish minister that such was the intention of our govt. But what was still more remarkable, and might afford greater ground for calling the integrity of the intentions of our govt. into question, the register ships, it was well Known, were then expected. Mr. Frere, as well as every person else, must have been aware of that circumstance, and at this very period is, he found all at once using decisive language and insisting on having his pass-347ports.&#x2014;His ldp. after noticing several other topics, in which be animadverted on the conduct of his maj.'s ministers, from the commencement of the negotiation, to the actual exercise of hostilities, concluded by moving an amendment similar to the one moved this day in the House of Commons by Mr. Grey, to which we refer the reader.

{"date": ["1805", "feb", "11"], "content": "then rose, and in a speech of considerable length, entered into an examination of the papers on the table, and of the whole conduct of ministers during the negotiation. His ldp. professed his utter astonishment that the noble lord who had risen to express his determination to oppose any motion for an adjournment, had not thought it his duty to say one word in explanation of the huge mass of papers on the table, so as to throw some light on a355transaction, which in his mind reflected no credit on the administration of which he formed a part; nay, which brought great discredit on the country itself. It was impossible to conceive any thing more extraordinary, than the conduct of his maj.'s ministers had been in the whole of the negotiation, if they were to judge from the documents that had been laid before them; for though paper was heaped on paper, and they had deliveries after deliveries, there was no communication made by which they could learn the motives of govt. in this most important and calamitous affair. There appeared nothing but negligence, inattention, and mystery. For the whole course of 18 months that this negotiation had lasted, there appeared but four dispatches from ministers to Mr. Frere, at Madrid; and even these were distinguished only by their containing nothing to the purpose, or by being unintelligible, or contradictory. The noble lord opposite to him had thrown out a challenge that no charge could be brought against ministers for their conduct in this negotiation; he accepted the challenge, and presumed to say he should prove, from their own papers, that they had been most criminally remiss, silent, and inattentive to all the eager and repeated applications which had been made to them by the Spanish govt. to explain their system; that they had even kept their own agent at the court of Madrid ignorant of their views; that they had neglected every opening that had been made them of preventing a rupture; that they had. without provocation, treated, in the first instance, with indifference and contempt the court of Spain, and when they had thus finally driven them into the hands of France that they had acted with violence, injustice, and unpardonable precipitancy. The noble lord to illustrate these points, shewed from the documents on the table, that after the commencement of the war with France, ministers had taken more than a fortnight to think of an instruction to Mr. Frere at Madrid, how to conduct himself towards that important court on that interesting emergency. Their first instruction was dated the 2d of June, and from that period no second letter was sent by them to their minister at Madrid, until the 24th of Nov. following. And this, though he repeatedly solicited them to be explicit, and urged the necessity of treating the Spanish court with care, attention, and respect. This was not all. The Spanish court was most desirous of coming to a good un-356derstanding with England, and made the most earnest applications for that purpose; No answer whatever was given to these ref peated invitations to an amicable negotiation. Though goaded by the French govt. and in the most anxious state of suspense, they could not obtain from our ministers any other treatment than that of silent contempt. In this way the months of June, July, and Aug. passed, without the slightest attention by ministers to their applications, and even to the letters and instances of their own minister resident there. Although he informed them that, at that time, the cause of England was then popular with all ranks of people in Spain; that they were most desirous of connecting themselves with G. Brit, as the means of keeping them out of the hands of France; and that the moment was most favourable for that purpose. All this was neglected, and, at length, driven by the criminal neglect and silence of England, the Spanish govt. was forced to yield to the influence of France, and. agree to permit a small body of 1,500 men to march through Spain to recruit their ships at Ferrol. This fact Mr. Frere transmitted oh the 12th of Sept. and stated. the remonstrance which he had made of his own head, on the subject. Notwithstanding this, it was not till the 24th of Nov. that he received an instruction on the subject; and then Mr. Frere being at length relieved in some; soft from the painful ignorance and nullity in which he had been kept, thanked ministers most gratefully for telling him what he was to do.&#x2014;The noble baron displayed, in strong colours, the indecision, and weakness of the whole system of the few instructions which appeared in the immense space of time that elapsed, which he described as \"Yari nantes in gurgite vasto.\" In no one instance had ministers given Mr. Frere plain, intellible grounds to act upon. In the first dispatch of his noble friend, he not only avoids giving any opinion himself respecting the contingent to be furnished to France, but he absolutely prohibits the English charge d'affaires at the Spanish court from giving any; or in other words, he sends him instructions to negotiate, and prohibits him at the same from going into the particulars of negotiation. If noble lords would cast their eyes over the correspondence, they would clearly perceive, that a mutual distrust had taken place between the Spanish minister and Mr. Frere. The latter in his letter says, that there were all good dispositions on the357part of the Spanish govt.; he states the subject of his conversation with the prince of peace, from which it was apparent, that he was afraid to make an opening to us until we had made one to him. This was surely a case which it was natural to suppose would elicit some fresh instructions from his maj.'s ministers; quite the contrary; from any thing that appeared in the correspondence on the table, it passed without a single observation on their part. Mr. Frere then goes on to state how popular the English govt. and character was with the king of Spain, the nobility, the government, the mercantile body, nay even with the mob, and that this happy disposition was only to be maintained by a system of conciliation. This, one would have thought, should have produced something; he such thing; even the Spanish minister here was treated with a degree of disrespect, as far as not paying any attention to his representations, that no gentleman should experience. The offer of the king of Spain to mediate was, it would appear, treated with total contempt and indifference, and during all the time that those conferences took place, France had not negotiated. Had the English minister been authorised to have met the Spanish govt. France might have been anticipated, and not suffered to negotiate, as she did in the sequel, upon her own grounds. The conference with the prince of peace had this singularity in it, that to all the overtures made by him, Mr. Frere, in consequence of peremptory instructions from his court, declined answering any one of them; he says \"my mouth is shut, I can neither converse with you in mj own name, nor in that of my government.\" He would put it to the noble viscount (Sid-mouth) how, if the case were reversed, he would have endured such treatment. Well might the charges of indecision and incapacity have been brought against the govt. Time, it was said, waited for no man; opportunity, it may be as truly said., waited for no one; French demand and necessity could not wait for the tardy progress of negotiation.&#x2014;His lordship having' expatiated at some length, on the remissness of his maj.'s ministers with respect to the necessary instructions to Mr. Frere, proceeded to state, that the whole of that gent.'s mission, during the continuance of this negotiation, was marked by the same atyle of remissness, and that at successive periods he had been suffered to remain for 2 months, for 6 months, and even for 8358months together, without any, specific instructions from his own court how to act, but left entirely to himself; and, at one time particularly, from the 21st Jan. until the 22d of May, when the noble lord retired from the secretaryship for foreign affairs, no instructions whatever were sent to Mr. Frere; the consequence of which was, that he was treated by the Spanish ministry as a person not having the confidence of that court by whom he was accredited; and he was constantly made to feel that they had weekly communications from their minister at London, upon topics of Mr. Frere's own mission, but upon which he was totally uninformed, and thus incapacitated to maintain his station with due respect to his official character, or to act with the necessary degree of effect upon those with whom be was appointed to treat. Of the documents necessary to the information of the house upon this important subject, there was one which had been referred to, both in the notes of Mr. Frere and the chev. Cevallos, but which appeared not only to be lost but that even not one of the ministers concerned in the formation of that treaty, could remember any one article of the contents, more especially as the treaty was referred to as a convention of neutrality, both by the Spanish minister and British ambassador; but of the merits of which convention the house could, not possibly judge, unacquainted, as they were with its specific terms. So far as the documents laid before the house served to throw any light upon the subject of neutrality, as to Spain, his majesty's ministers had acted with the most shameful duplicity; for, at first, it appeared from those documents, that the treaty by which Spain agreed to supply a certain military contingent to France, in case of a war, was recognized by his maj.'s ministers. But Spain professing the most zealous wishes, to avoid every thing like hostility towards this country, by a subsequent treaty with France, had commuted her contingent in military force for one in money, to which there was apparently no objection. Shortly afterwards the specific price of respect to the neutrality of Spain, as stipulated by Mr. Frere, was the cessation of every thing like armament in any of her arsenals, preclusion to the condemnation and sale of British prizes in Spanish ports, and the same treatment to British as to French ships of war in all her harbours, and notwithstanding that all those terms were359strictly complied with on the part of Spain, nevertheless, the Spanish govt. is again told, that their stipulated contingent in money must not be paid to France, without leaving the British govt. perfectly at liberty to consider such payment a legitimate cause of war, whenever they should find it convenient to act thereupon. Ministers were still farther reprehensible, after circumstances of personal irritation had occurred between Mr. Frere and the person who was supposed to have the greatest weight in the councils of the Spanish govt. (the prince of peace), in having committed the remainder of the negotiation, after it became necessary for Mr. Frere to take his departure, to his brother and secretary, as charg&#x00E9; d'affaires; a gentleman certainty of whom he should never wish to be supposed as speaking otherwise than with the highest respect, and who, however highly respected in his private character in this country, yet whose official rank did not bear that high estimation in the other courts of Europe, suited to the importance of such a negotiation, but least of all others at the court of Spain. Instructions were sent to this gent, to require, on the part of the Spanish govt. not an explanation, but the declaration of a disposition to explain certain particulars with respect to the treaty last entered into with France; and in case of such declaration, that a minister properly accredited was to be sent to the Spanish court to enter into that explanation, and settle finally the question respecting the neutrality of Spain; but Mr. Frere oversteps his commission, demands the explanation himself, is refused, and takes his departure; and no accredited minister is sent to Spain to avert the consequences of this misunderstanding. Nevertheless, the Spanish minister at London, the chev, d'Anduaga, as soon as he heard of the departure of Mr. Frere from his court, waits upon the British minister for foreign affairs, is unable to see him through indisposition, addresses to him a respectful letter, signifying his readiness, notwithstanding all that has passed, to enter into negotiation, and prevent, if possible, all hostile extremities between both countries; but to this letter he never receives the slightest answer, nor even the usual attention Of ordinary civility. Such was the treatment shewn to a high-minded and most gallant nation, who plumed itself on the observance of etiquette, and whose pride was wounded by the slightest appearance360of neglect. Such was the style, of the negotiation which ministers could boast of as being free from reproach! Such was the. moderation which they bad shewn in this most delicate affair!&#x2014;But in this way was the negotiation managed until the cloud came over our heads and the thunder burst; Admiral Cochrane wrote home to say, that there were 3 ships of the line apparently fitting out in the port of Ferrol. At the same time be wrote to Mr. Frere and to the governor of Ferrol. The Spanish govt., had at once and unequivocally declared, that the sole object of this was to transport some troops to the bay of Biscay, where a rebellion had broken out; and at the same time the governor of Ferrol had said, that as it gave him uneasiness the men should be put. ashore, and sent round by land, however inconvenient. Admiral Cochrane was not content with this, but said he should insist on receiving a detailed account of their being dismantled. The noble baron intreated noble lords to make this case their own, and say what their feelings would be if such language were used to a British admiral commanding at Portsmouth, because he had chosen to send troops round the coast in a few ships of the line? Such was the commencement of our violence; and though a satisfactory answer, as he thought, was given, (for he sincerely believed that they had no object in putting some few men and provisions on board these 3 ships, but really to quell the tumult in Biscay, it being much easier to send troops by sea than through that mountainous province; at a time, too, when they were labouring under the dread of a malignant fever,) yet we proceeded to the violence of assaulting their ships on the high seas. This had been said to be no more than laying an embargo on an enemy's ships. Was there no difference between delaying merchant's ships which might be delivered back; and assaulting ships on the high seas? There was a mighty difference. Stop the ships of a merchant and they may be delivered up. Take his property and he might be indemnified. Imprison seamen and they might be discharged. But burn, sink, and blow up ship and crew, and who can restore the innocent blood which is spilt? There were some acts of hardship and severity which the laws of civilized war permitted, but this atrocious act of barbarity was contrary to all law of nations, and stamped indelible infamy on our name. The French361branded us with the name of a mercantile people, and said that we were ever thirsting after gold. They would therefore impute this violence to our eagerness for the dollars. Better that all the dollars, and ten times the quantity, were paid, so as it could wash away the stain which had been brought on our arms. At a time when we were armed to repel the atrocities of France, this was not a time to display such a spirit.&#x2014;His lordship shewed that the seizure of the treasure ships had no resemblance to the stoppage of the Dutch, nor to the measure recommended by the Earl of Chatham, in 176l. He deprecated the war in which this series of neglect, insolence, contempt, and violence bad plunged us. He denied that it was popular. A war with Spain, however easy ministers had shewn that it was to provoke and begin, was not so easy to get out of. If the stories that were floating were true, of desperate, mad, and romantic expeditions against Spanish America, he would prophecy, that it would be a most calamitous war to G. Britain. A more perilous, and a more calamitous adventure for the sake of mere plunder, could not be undertaken than such an expedition, either for the country that gave it birth, or for humanity in general; for while it would operate to entail misery on a great portion of the human race, it tended to exhaust the blood and treasure of this country, to disperse our naval force, to ruin our army, and be productive of the worst mischiefs to the country. The great principles which it was the duty of a wise govt. to hold up to the people of this country, were truth, justice, and moderation, and not rapacity and blood.&#x2014;His lordship, concluded a most brilliant and impressive speech by saying, that he did not rise thus to discharge his duty from any motive of wanton attack on the king's ministers, or to strive to destroy their popularity, but from a serious conviction that the war might have been prevented by common care on their part, and that as it was totally unprovoked and unnecessary, so also would it be most grievous and unfortunate to the country.", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-grenville", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},
{"date": ["1805", "feb", "11"], "content": "said, he had purposely avoided rising earlier in the discussion; because, feeling his own official conduct deeply interested in the whole of this negotiation, he wished to bear, at length, the whole of the arguments against it, before he offered himself to the consideration362of the house. His lordship then entered very much at length in reply to the observations of the noble baron; and argued, that, however the house might be disposed to censure his maj.'s ministers, on this subject, they were bound to support his maj. in bringing the war to an honourable conclusion. He thought, from the whole conduct of Spain, as well as the. treaty of Ildefonso, by which she became,ipso facto,the offensive and defensive ally of Trance, she must be justly considered as hostile to this country, and regarded not as a neutral power, but as one against whom policy enjoined the forbearance of hostility as long as it was possible. When we entered into the present contest with France there was nothing like a continental diversion in our favour. It would have been therefore almost an act of insanity to provoke at once all the enemies of whom we had in different shades and degrees to complain. We were at all events to wait until our naval and military establishments had been raised to their proper height. Spain, in this point of view, required peculiar management; and the more so, as the safety of Portugal was involved in the issue. Here was therefore, a radical mistake on the part of the noble baron who had last spoken. He wished that every question should be so categorically put as to leave no issue but that of peace or war. This was certainly not the mode to be pursued when the great object in view was delay; a delay which might serve to enable Spain to disentangle herself from her obligation, and empower us to provide for the safety of our ally, the queen of Portugal. If these objects were held in view, he would appeal to the documents on the table, and boldly ask, whether the instructions transmitted to our minister at Madrid were not fully adequate to every emergency? There were some points on which it was impossible to give a definite instruction. It was difficult to say, for instance, whether a contingent in men or money, supplied to an enemy would be least disadvantageous. With respect to a pecuniary aid, the question was in the degree. If it surpassed the value of the military contingent, then its operation was most hostile and mischievous; but this was a point which, with all our efforts, we could not possibly ascertain.&#x2014;On one other point the noble bart. was clearly mistaken in his argument. It was true that Mr. Frere had stipulated with M. Cevallos for the cessa-363tion of the Spanish armaments, and for the stoppage of the condemnation and sale of prizes in the Spanish ports. These, however, were conditions, on the observance of which he promised to remain at Madrid; they were not, as had been wrongly supposed, conditions of neutrality, or binding as such on this country. But, even supposing them to be of the latter description, the obligations had been all violated by Spain.&#x2014;The armaments in Ferrol had been lightly treated by the noble baron. But, when it was recollected, that there were four French sail of the line in that harbour, and that, by an effort of no great difficulty, a junction might be made highly dangerous to our blockading squadron, the suspicions wore a more serious aspect. As to the conveyance of troops to Biscay it was all a feint, as there was no port in that quarter where a single man could be landed. The fact was, that Spain was determined to declare war, as on every former occasion, as soon as her treasure ships were safely arrived. In the interim, the hostile mind of that country was manifested in every possible way. The permission given to French troops, sailors, and artillerymen, to march through her territory, was certainly no slight indication of hostility. This, the noble baron will probably say, is one of admiral Cochrane's stories; but if he will look into the correspondence, he will find two notes on the subject from Mr. Frere, stating the circumstances, and which are not, in any the minutest particle, disavowed. It was on these full and ample grounds that we entered on that modified hostility which is so much the ground of reproach. Why, it is said, did we not issue letters of marque and reprisal? The answer is obvious. The property of the captors it would not have been in our power to reclaim and restore, but by detaining the vessels the power of restitution was left in our hands. This was certainly an incomplete hostility; but let it be recollected, that when this was ordered, the right of full, complete, and absolute hostility, was substantially in our hands. If Spain has suffered in this instance, let it be recollected that the fault is entirely her own. Had she been capable of manly exertion in her own behalf, from us she would have found every support and assistance, But as history shews that small states have arisen to the greatest heights by industry, activity, and energy, so large empires are found to moulder364away through apathy, inertness, and pusillanimity. Our view of the question this case must be merely personal. We must not permit either the strength of one power, or the weakness of another, to be converted into a weapon for our destruction. This has been stigmatized as a mercenary war; but this proposition, said his ldp. I must deny. Wars of ambition, wars for conquest, wars for extension of territory&#x2014; all these are hateful; but a war for profit has in it something loathsome and revolting to every generous mind. The carrying the war into the Spanish Colonies, which has been thrown out this evening, had no weight whatever hi the decision of ministers. They forbore, as long as forbearance: was practicable, and they did not strike, until the blow, in their judgment, could no longer be avoided. If we could see the once great and illustrious nation of Spain rouse once more from the lassitude into which she has sunk, and display that spirit and those noble energies which once rendered her so justly renowned amongst the nations of Europe, then might we hope to see her retrieve that honourable character heretofore so justly venerated: but, sunk as she is under the vassalage and dictation of the person who now rules France, friendly to us she dare not be; neutral she cannot be; and hostile she must be, at the mandate of her ally: and, therefore, it was the duty of his maj 's ministers to be guarded against those hostilities to which from necessity or otherwise she might be disposed.", "author_id": "/people/mr-robert-jenkinson", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},

He could not, however, on so very momentous a proposition as that, for still longer suspending, in so considerable and important a portion of the empire, the most valuable privilege of our glorious constitution, suppress his decided opinion that before the right hon. bart. called for the assent of parliament to his introduction of such a measure, something more than mere light grounds should have been stated to justify such a proposition. The statement that an Irish committee was sitting in Paris, avowing hostile purposes for the invasion of Ireland, was surely not a sufficient reason for suspending the constitution throughout that country, and involving a whole nation under one disgraceful proscription, with a few suspected traitors; for, if the mischief was really as extensive as the bill pretended, something more of explanation, and stronger grounds, ought to be submitted to Parliament, before their assent was called for to the continuance of so severe a measure. If the continuance of such a committee sitting at Paris was to operate as a justification for the continuance of such a law, we must look to no other limitation for its existence than the continuance of the war: for if the enemy should perceive that the appointment of such a committee at Paris was to operate as a cause for the perpetuation of a law that could not fail to wound and exasperate the national pride and feelings of the Irish people, and so far mould them to the purposes of discontent and disaffection, they might rest assured the enemy would be zealous to keep up that committee, and attach to it the utmost possible importance, if it were only to create a ground of alarm, distrust, and apprehension, towards Ireland, and thus to weaken the energies of both countries. He had been taught from his youth to estimate the benefits of theHabeas Corpus Actas the most invaluable part of the British constitution, and to think that it never ought to be suspended but upon the strongest grounds; all he should now say was, that no such grounds had been shewn as yet. It was of the first importance, that the people of Ireland should be taught to feel that the Imperial parliament was as, tender of their privileges, and as vigilant with regard to their rights and liberties, as towards those of the people of England. He would say, that with respect to Ireland, or North Britain, they ought even to be greater than them with respect to Eng-313land; and the granting such extraordinary powers in those parts of the empire ought to be most narrowly looked to, for great powers exercised at a great distance were more liable to be abused than when they were under the immediate inspection and controul of parliament. Instances had already been laid before the house of such powers being stretched, when the exercise of them was remote from examination. He therefore thought the house should not grant such powers when there was no ground laid. Nay, even the ground which was laid by the movers of the proposition was adverse to it. For when he looked back to the extraordinary circumstances with which the motion was introduced, he could not help thinking, that it was matter of doubt with the hon. gentlemen themselves whether the suspension should be renewed: First, above a week since notice had been given of the intention to move for the renewal. Two days after, this notice was expressly abandoned. He asked, why was the proposition of renewal first brought forward? having been brought forward, why was it abandoned? having been abandoned, why was it brought at all? He asked whether a measure of this kind, which was to be justified only by unavoidable necessity, which was hostile and dangerous to the vital principles of the constitution, should, without sufficient cause, be put upon a country, the greater part of whose people was as veil affected to the govt. as the English themselves? He conceived that this justification of so harsh a measure was particularly due to the people of Ulster, who were remarkable for their loyalty and attachment to the British constitution and British connexion; but who were at the same time a strong minded people, not likely to be satisfied with a measure of this nature, unless sufficient cause for it were shewn to them. He should, therefore, conclude with moving, as an amendment to the motion, the omission of the latter part of the motion, from the word 'that,' for the purpose of inserting these words, \"that a committee, consisting of 21 members, be formed by ballot, to examine such documents as may be laid before them, and to report to this house their opinion upon these documents, whether the continuance of the suspension of the habeas corpus act be a measure necessary to the tranquillity of Ireland at the present time.\"", "author_id": "/people/sir-simon-newport", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

Under these circumstances, it was prudent and necessary to continue the suspension; and not to endanger the constitution by exposing it, with unguarded confidence, to the attacks of those who would take shelter behind it for the purpose of destroying it. It was well known, that hired emissaries from France had come to Ireland with the treasonable designs of exciting disaffection, and conveying information.

He was himself the representative of a county as sincerely attached as any in Ireland to Britain, and the Brit. constitution. This measure was called for by the loyal part of the people for their security and protection against the machinations of the disaffected. It was not now prudent or desirable to go through all the circumstances which rendered such a measure necessary in a country just freed from one rebellion which had succeeded to another, and in which this bill would be the principal support of the loyal and well affected. It was also satisfactory to have an assurance from experience, that the powers it gave would not he abused. He knew the nobleman at the head of the Irish govt. and had opportunities of seeing that he inherited from his illustrious ancestors a zealous attachment to the constitution. He had, in fact, conducted himself in such a manner throughout the whole course of his govt. that there was not a man in the country who had not the fullest confidence that he would not abuse any power entrusted to him. With respect to grounds to be laid by govt. from the information that had reached it, he had to say, that while he teas in office in Ireland (as attorney general,) information had been given by persons connected with the disaffected; and that the exposing to public view the channels through which this information had been obtained, would have the effect to deprive govt. of the sources to future discoveries, and to expose the persons who had made the communication to the knife of the assassin.

{"date": ["1805", "feb", "08"], "content": "rose to offer a few obser-316vations upon this motion, which it was impossible for him to let pass without comment. The right hon. baronet had shewn no necessity whatsoever for a proposition which could not possibly be acceded to, without some reasonable ground. He had himself supported the suspension of the habeas corpus act on former occasions; but he had never supported it without strong reason. The house had more than once voted such a suspension, but never without strong and clear grounds fairly proved or notoriously existing. He should be sorry it would vote it without such grounds. A measure of this sort, however, was not to be voted as a thing of course, like a malt tax, or any other annual money bill, merely because a minister moves it at 24 hours notice, without any clear reason given why the house should adopt it. It was extraordinary, too, that the arguments offered in support of the measure bore most strongly against it. The first was in fact the very worst that could be thought of. For if the existence of an Irish committee in Paris, or the govt. here being credulous enough to believe that such a committee existed, was on all occasions to be sufficient grounds for suspending the habeas corpus, the suspension would continue, as the hon. baronet very justly said, constantly during the war, and even perhaps in time of peace; and the bare existence of such a committee may be made a ground of a similar suspension in every part of the empire. The question was not, however, what mischief such committees or those connected with them, intended, but what they could produce. It was not what disaffection, they wished or designed to raise in Ireland, but whether their means of disturbing that country were such, that the suspension of the habeas corpus was necessary to prevent them.&#x2014;Was the constitution to be stopped, and set a-going, in this manner? When it was asked why this extraordinary power was called for, it was answered, not that there were disturbances in Ireland; not that it was necessary the better to repel invasion; but that there were committees of united Irishmen sitting at Paris, and that there were mischievous people in Ireland. But the question was not, what either of these descriptions of persons wished to do; but what the others could do with them. None of those who spoke for the motion would give up the point of the general loyalty317of the people: all contended, that the great mass of the people were loyal, but that there were some michievous persons: and so there were here in England. But he would ask, whether the mischief that may be produced by these committees in Ireland, was such as to render it necessary to deprive all Ireland of the habeas corpus, the suspension of which may be followed with other measures of a still more odious nature? And the only reason why this broad and unqualified power should be given was, that from the character of the person to whom it was to be entrusted, it was not likely to be abused. In a free country such as this was, and he hoped always would be, the introduction of arbitrary power ought to be guarded against with the strictest jealousy: vast and extraordinary powers ought not to be delegated merely because some mischievous persons were taken up, and the persons to whom the power was to be entrusted for the present were of a mild and moderate disposition. If the govt. was to be armed with extraordinary powers, which it was fit it should when the country wished it for its own security, it was necessary the danger should be of such an extent as to impress on every man's mind the propriety of giving such powers. It should not be said, that no ground should be stated, lest there may be danger of discovering the sources from which the information was derived. The grounds which would justify the putting the country under martial law could not be of such a secret nature. The extent and magnitude of it must be such as to render it generally known. However, if any objection of this kind could be made with any propriety, it was obviated by the mode of inquiry which was proposed by the hon. bart. (sir J. Newport.) He recollected also that an hon. friend of his, if he would allow him to call him so (Mr. Dillon), in moving the address to his maj. drew a very flattering picture of the tranquillity of Ireland. Was it not extraordinary, that without any thing having happened since to do away the effect of this picture, without any explanation to render the colouring of it less strong, the representative of the Irish govt. suddenly started up, and without assigning any reason, proposed to suspend the Brit. constitution in Ireland. He agreed with the hon. baronet (sir J. Newport,) that we ought to be most tender in granting extraordinary powers with respect to Ireland318and Scotland, not only as a power exercised at a distance from controul and inspection was more liable to be abused, but also because there was an obligation of honour and consciousness to be delicate in granting powers, the weight of which would fall exclusively on others, while they could not touch ourselves. The declarations of one or two gentlemen, however respectable, was not a ground on which the house ought to be satisfied of the necessity of a measure of this nature. A larger justification ought to be given for depriving of so large a portion of its constitution, a people which had confided its legislature and its liberties to us&#x2014;a confidence which deserved a care and gratitude very foreign to such monstrous proceedings as the one now proposed.", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-windham-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

{"date": ["1805", "feb", "08"], "content": "&#x2014;Much, sir, as I have been alarmed, and have had to regret the opinions avowed, and the conduct pursued by the ministers of this country for several years back, particularly while headed by the right hon. gent. who now presides over the administration of his maj.'s govt. yet I confess that I have never felt an equal degree of alarm to that which the sentiments he has just uttered have excited in my mind. I should hope, sir, that he did not speak seriously. If he did; if he really and deliberately holds such sentiments, I must say that I consider him as maintaining principles the most alarming that I have ever heard promulgated in this house or this country, and such as I could scarcely suppose it possible that any man who imagined the people of England retained any degree of regard for their liberties, would venture to declare, or who professed even a respect for the spirit of the British constitution would hear without pain. If the doctrines which the right hon. gent. has this night avowed, be those upon which he means to act, and if he should obtain power sufficient to carry them into effect, melancholy indeed is the prospect for this country ! But, perhaps, the right hon. gent. meant to use the declarations I have referred to merely as a defence against the arguments of my right hon. friend (Mr. Windham), and not as the indication of a settled opinion. If even so, they were inefficient to the purpose of such defence, and they certainly went much beyond any principles avowed by the right hon. gent. or any of his colleagues, during the last war; yet they were not inconsistent with those principles. They were different from, though not contrary to, the nature of those maxims which dictated that mischievous course of policy towards the people and their privileges, which it was my uniform endeavour to deprecate and prevent. Indeed, the rt. hon. gent. himself never attempted to go the length he has hazarded to-night. He never before ventured to maintain that because some of the people were bad subjects, the liberty of the whole people should be placed at the discretion of the minister and his agents by the suspension of theHabeas Corpus Act. With this statement he has coupled something which he meant as a reply to the arguments of my right hon. friend (Mr. Windham), and as a charge upon me and those gent. who acted with me in resisting the frequent motions for the suspension of the Habeas Corpus324Act, which in the course of the last way were carried through this house. The hon. gent. stated that my right hon. friend has had recourse, on this occasion, to that which he himself so often baffled before, when used by my friends and me, and which the right hon. gent. calls a \"clumsy dilemma.\" But I would tell him, and my right hon. friend also, that it was not the dilemma we stated they succeeded in refuting, but it was the clumsy misrepresentation of that dilemma, against which they directed their objections. We never did maintain, that, while the majority was loyal, there could be no necessity for a measure similar to that now before the house. We never could have asserted any thing so absurd and clumsy, that the loyalty of a mere majority formed an argument against the adoption of any measures of precaution against the disaffection of a mere minority. We never even said that the loyalty of a considerable majority would furnish an irresistible objection to such measures. Our reasoning was uniformly grounded upon the degree and nature of the disloyalty alleged to exist, which we did not conceive such as to justify the harsh system of proceeding then pursued by the right hon. gent. But it suited the right hon. gent.'s purpose to give another description to our opinions, and against that other and unjust description his arguments were always levelled. The right hon. gent. and his colleagues appeared to me in every instance, to state insufficient grounds to call for the rigorous measures of the last war, but yet almost any grounds they urged at any time, were sufficiency itself compared to those that are laid for the measure now proposed. How is the state of Ireland described, even by those who support this proposition? Why, that it is in general, and particularly in the province of Ulster, which is by far the most populous and important district of the country, and once the most suspected of disloyalty, as sound, as well disposed, and as loyal as any part of England. Here, then, we have a comparison made that enables us to decide as to the nature of the necessity that exists for the farther continuance of such a bill. Here we have a rule and measure to guide our judgment&#x2014;and, what is most extraordinary, furnished to us by the very men, who, notwithstanding, assert the necessity of this measure. But their reason for the assertion is truly curious&#x2014;\"because there are some disaffected325persons in the country.\" And where is it, I should be glad to know, that such persons are not to be found? Are there not bad subjects of every kind to be met with, perhaps, in every part of England? Yet, surely, no man will venture to alledge that as a reason for extending the operation of the measure before the house to this country. Perhaps, some one may be found to do so. Possibly the right hon. gent. may feel disposed to urge such a proposition. If he should entertain the wish, most certainly the adoption of the motion of the hon. bart. will afford him a most encouraging precedent. Unless it be pretended that the measure of justice which is due to the people of Ireland is very different from that which belongs to the people of this country, and that different, nay contrary principles of argument are applicable to the two countries, it cannot be said that the English nation enjoys the least security against the suspension of its constitution at the will of any minister, if the motion submitted by the hon. bart. be acceded to upon such slight grounds, or rather upon no grounds whatever.&#x2014;I have stated, that I see not the least necessity for this proposition, and I always stated upon similar propositions in the course of the last war, that I never saw an adequate necessity for adopting them. This statement my full conviction justifies me in repeating, and I say again to the right hon. gent. and to my right hon. friend also, that they never succeeded in their reasoning against my friends and me, but by mis-stating our argument. We continually put the question which naturally suggested itself to our minds, and which my right hon. friend has very properly put to-night, namely of what consequence is the discontent or disaffection of a few, if the great body of the people be sound and loyal? Certainly, the consequence is not such as to warrant the suspension of public liberty; and I never imagined that any man would have the hardihood to assert in this house that it was. But the right hon. gent has exceeded my expectation. In the whole progress of his hostility to freedom, and the constitution of England, never has he uttered any thing so dangerous and alarming as we have heard from him to-night. Never has he attempted to take so great a stride before. In addition to the existence of disaffection in Ireland, the right hon. gent. states another reason for the adoption of the measure under consideration, and it is this,326which he described in very lofty terms; that we are engaged in war, and with an enemy who threatens to destroy our constitution and independence. I would ask were we ever at war with any power, particularly in France, that was not willing to destroy our independence, aye, quite as willing as the present government of France? I never heard that we were. It was, however, reserved for the right hon. gent. to maintain that war is a good ground for suspending theHabeas Corpus Act. But the right hon. gent. states, that the enemy threatened Ireland with an invasion; and did he not also threaten G. Britain? Both these reasons, therefore, are as applicable to the one country as to the other, and would, as I said before, equally sustain the extension of the measure before the house to both countries. When reasons of that sort, therefore, are stated, I must feel as much alarm for G. Britain as for Ireland. I approve highly the generous sentiments that have been expressed by the hon. bart. who moved the amendment. He feels a laudable tenderness and solicitude for Ireland, and so do I. But I feel also for G. Britain; and who knows how soon it may be doomed to suffer from the effects of that principle, which the right hon. gent. seeks to establish in the adoption of the motion before the house? That right hon. gent. would, I presume, be the last to deny, that there existed as strong grounds to apprehend an invasion of G. Britain as of Ireland. Different opinions prevailed as to the probability of invasion; but in the mind of the right hon. gent. there seemed to be no doubt that it would take place. Indeed, notwithstanding the close blockade of Brest, and the vigilant activity of our fleets and cruizers, with the increase of our land force, which none professed a desire to increase further than the right hon. gent. still was he haunted by the apprehension, and loudly proclaimed the probability, that an invasion of G. Britain was to be expected from day to day. This I mention, merely to shew, that at least in the judgment of the right hon. gentleman, there exists a good reason, in his view, for the suspension of theHabeas Corpus Actin Great Britain as well as in Ireland; and also to account for the alarm which I think must be universally excited by the opinions he has delivered in the course of this debate. If we are to be told, that although the people327of Ireland are as loyal as those of any county, in England, that because some persons in Ireland are alleged to be disaffected, we are, without any other reason, and without any previous examination of the nature and sufficiency of the grounds stated, to assent to the motion of the hon. bart. then I say, adieu to the security of British freedom; adieu to that Habeas Corpus Act which is the proudest boast and noblest guard of the British constitution. If the right hon. gent. and those who act with him, seriously think that the grounds they urge are sufficient to warrant the suspension of theHabeas Corpus Act, when, I would request to know, I don't mean as to date, but under what circumstances is that important privilege to be restored? Upon looking over the history of this act, I find that when, in former instances, it was thought necessary to suspend its operation, that suspension was but of very short duration. In the reign of Queen Anne it was suspended twice; and during the reign of the two first branches of the House of Brunswick, it was suspended more than once. I find that from the Revolution down to the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, this important privilege was not withdrawn from the British people so often as it has been during a very few years of the administration of the right hon. gent. And yet during the period that intervened, the country was frequently engaged in war &#x2014;frequently threatened with invasion, and was much disturbed by disaffection also: a disaffection which sprung not from Jacobins, but Jacobites. The latter party, I must observe, was quite as resolute and enterprising as the former, and much stronger in numbers, influence, property and power.&#x2014;What a material difference does this reflection manifest between the character and views of the right hon. gent. and that of any minister who preceded him! The right hon. gent. contends that notoriety is a sufficient ground for parliament to proceed upon, without instituting a committee of inquiry. He has so contended on other occasions. But did he and others who thought with him, argue that what they called the notoriety of disaffection, at the commencement of the last war, was an adequate ground to induce parliament to agree to a measure of the same nature as the present? No. And though that notoriety was generally asserted by the right hon. gent. and his friends, and by none, perhaps, more than by my right328hon. friend&#x2014;(and I mention, that for the purpose of defending him against the observations just made by the right hon. gent.) although the notoriety was such as was said to be obvious in the public streets, yet ministers did not attempt to apply to parliament for a suspension of theHabeas Corpus Actwithout instituting a committee of inquiry to examine and report upon the information which govt. possessed. That committee made a report to the house, and upon that report the proposals for the suspension of theHabeas Corpus Actwas grounded. This was the course of proceeding which my right hon. friend supported, and this is the course which he recommends now. Can it be said, then, with any degree of fairness, that the least degree of inconsistency is attributable to him for opposing a motion of such importance as the present, which is ushered into the house by the mere statement of a minister, and that statement itself containing such vain and futile grounds. The passing of this act 18 months ago, without any previous inquiry, cannot be justly urged as a precedent to induce even those who agreed to it, to accede to the present motion, for the circumstances are not at all analagous. The alarm created by the intelligence received of the riot in Dublin, afforded some excuse for the precipitancy with which the proposition of ministers was then adopted. It was carried on the spur of the occasion, and some might have hoped, that when there was time, ministers would communicate more satisfactory grounds for the existence of such a measure, or that the house would institute an inquiry to ascertain the necessity of its continuance. These ideas might have influenced the acquiescence of some gentlemen in the conduct they then pursued. But my right hon. friend took a different and a wiser course. He urged the necessity of previous inquiry, and had I been present, I should have certainly supported him, although I should have had to resist the argument of another right hon. friend of mine, who I understand maintained that the bill for suspending theHabeas Corpus Actshould, under these circumstances, be immediately passed. (Here Mr. Sheridan, towards whom Mr. Fox looked, signified his dissent.) Then, resumed Mr. Fox, I am glad it is a mistake. I am happy to find that my right hon. friend, was not among the number of those who329were deceived in the expectations which induced them to vote for that measure; which, although it has been now 18 months in existence, no inquiry has been instituted, nor have ministers communicated any further information to the house on the subject than what was contained in his maj. message&#x2014;That my right hon. friend was right, notwithstanding the statement of the right hon. gent. in supposing that this measure was dropped, will not, I think, be denied by any candid man who considers the circumstances. After having given notice of the motion some time back, the hon. bart. put it offsine die.The right hon. gent. has said that the reason of that postponement was the press of business: but that need not have prevented the hon. bart. from mentioning some day for bringing it forward again. The omission to do so appears to betray something like a design to take the house by surprise, or to raise an argument out of the shortness of the time between this and the expiration of the act against the delay of any previous inquiry. If, without such inquiry, you enact this measure, upon the mere statement of a minister, upon such evidence, as, according to the principle of the right hon. gent. is sufficient to establish the necessity of a legislative act of this nature; namely, the view and opinion of his maj. ministers, you may as well pass an act at once to invest the executive govt. with the power to suspend theHabeas Corpus Actwhenever it pleases. To apply to this house for an act of the description proposed by the right hon. bart. upon such authority as he has mentioned, is quite a mockery; and to answer that appeal by concurring in that act, will, in my mind, amount to little less than a virtual abandonment of our legislative functions. For what means an application to our judgment, unaccompanied by such information as is necessary to qualify that judgment to decide? I cannot understand the curious distinction which the right hon. gent. has drawn with respect to the character of Lord Harwicke, as applied to this measure. My right hon. friend stated manfully, that the character of any man, however pure, could form no reason in his mind to invest that man with arbitrary power. This is exactly my opinion. But the right hon. gent. says, that he only alluded to the character of lord Hardwicke, as an argument against the abuse of the power which this act is meant to estab-330lish, but as not at all applicable to the merits of the measure. This is to me a very nice and very unintelligible distinction; for the strongest reason in favour of any grant of power is, that it is, not liable to abuse. Therefore, when the right hon. gent. asserts so much with regard to the disposition and character of Lord Hardwicke, he is strongly recommending this measure; but yet his panegyric upon that noble lord, were it ever so well founded, would have no influence on my mind in favour of this proposition. I know there are certain theorists who hold the maxim, that the most uncontrouled authority may be granted without danger to an honest, able man; nay that an absolute monarchy is the best system of government, if the monarch were possessed of all the virtues and talents of which man is capable, but I am not one of those theorists. Let the disposition of a man be what it may, I will not consent to invest him with extraordinary, unconstitutional powers, for this plain reason, that it is subject to abuse. The virtue of a man is therefore, no argument with me in favour of such grants; because I learn from the history of mankind, because particularly the history of the constitution, and my own experience, forbid such grants, I am impelled to dread the abuse of power to whomsoever it may be given. These are my reasons for not allowing any weight to the argument, drawn from the character of lord Hardwicke. Into that character itself I will not now enter. I have reasons which form stronger grounds of complaint against that noble lord in my mind, than perhaps they would form in the minds of others. I shall not now mention them. It is enough with me to justify the vote I mean to give against the measure under consideration, that I will not intrust such power to any man. If character were a sufficient reason to justify the constitution of such a power, that reason a minister could always find among the nobility of this country. If lord Hardwicke did not answer, another and another nobleman of unexceptionable character could be immediately found to fill his place. I cannot, therefore, listen to such reasoning. My objection is, to grant the power proposed to the office, not to the man.&#x2014;As the right hon. gent. has not hinted when the measure before the house is likely to cease, I suppose, from some observations of his, that it is his intention that it shall continue during the present331war, and nothing more likely that he may propose to extend it to this country. if he pleases to do so, he can adduce reasons quite as strong as he has offered in support of the motion of the hon. bart.; and why should it be presumed that the right hon. gent. is not as fond of enjoying extraordinary power himself in this country, as of granting it to any Lord Lieutenant? Ireland being now admitted by all to be in a general state of tranquillity, I cannot conceive what change in her situation can take place that is likely to induce the right hon. gent. to put an end to this odious measure. If, although Ireland be tranquil, the existence of what is called an Irish committee at Paris, he considered a reason for measures like that before the house, then is the French govt. furnished with the means of perpetually and sorely annoying this country, by depriving the people of their liberty. For that govt. has nothing more to do than to create, or to promulgate the existence of an Irish or an English committee also, and upon that, it seems, combined with the popular discontent which such measures as this under discussion, will always produce, an English minister may found a reason for investing himself and his friends with the extraordinary power of suspending the constitution of England. Among other singular and indeed incredible things, we are told by the supporters of this bill, that the majority of the people of Ireland will gladly hear of its re-enactment, because they are so confident of its necessity, and they are so much attached to lord Hardwicke, that they are convinced that any power would in his hands be safe from abuse. As to the disposition of the people I shall say nothing. But there are some facts with respect to the abuse of power in Ireland under this bill, which I shall take an opportunity of stating more at large, when the motion, of which an hon. gent. (Mr. Fitzgerald) has this day given notice, is brought before the house. There is one gross instance of abuse, which I cannot even now refrain from alluding to; I mean that of Mr. Todd Jones. This gent. I have reason to believe, has, on the ground of mere suspicion, suffered a most rigorous imprisonment in a loathsome jail, for upwards of 16 months. From the treatment he has experienced, and the situation in which he is placed, he has, in fact, suffered enough of punishment, even had he been guilty of a heavy crime. In-332deed, he has endured so much, that countries where the laws are less several it would be deemed quite sufficient to atone for treason or felony. There are other cases also which I could state, but I shall reserve them for the occasion I have already alluded to. But even suppose I allow every merit that may be ascribed to lord Hardwicke, or his secretary, and those immediately about his govt. still my objection to this bill would not be removed. For I feel it to be one of the great mischiefs of arbitrary power, that even though the principals in the administration of it be ever so virtuous, so vigilant, or so able, still acts will be committed by some of those to whom in its various ramifications, that power will be necessarily delegated, that the principals cannot prevent, and which, if communicated to them, would make them shudder with as much horror as any other persons would be apt to feel. These are the reasons which urge me to resist this and the other bill, of which the hon. bart. gave notice some time since; but of which, I hope, I shall hear no more. I cannot see the least reason for the adoption of such measures, much less such strong grounds of necessity as could alone justify their introduction. I trust, then, that by rejecting them we shall shew the people that we have their liberty not merely in our mouths, but in our hearts; and that we will not abandon our duty to preserve that sacred trust, upon idle rumours, or light ministerial whispers.", "author_id": "/people/mr-charles-fox-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

The hon. gent. who had just sat down, had given to the sentiments of his333hon. friend, on the present state of Ireland, a construction which they would not fairly bear. They had never asserted, that the whole of Ireland was as loyal as England, but that certain provinces were so. Ulster, for instance, the inhabitants of which were certainly as well disposed to the existing govt. as those of any county in England whatever. The hon. gent. had alluded to what he was pleased to term the precipitation with which the bill for suspending theHabeas Corpus Actin Ireland was carried through parliament in July 1803. He would just recal the attention of the house to the circumstances of the time. Antecedently to that period, application had been made to govt. requesting, for the security of the well-affected, that a suspension of the Habeas Corpus might be procured; but the ministry, actuated by motives of forbearance, he supposed, or not aware of the extent of the danger, refused their concurrence. What followed? The rebellion. In the mean time, the govt. having become sensible of the necessity of the measure, brought forward the suspension of theHabeas Corpus Act, and obtained for it the sanction of parliament; but it was too late. He was convinced, and knew it to be the opinion of many gent. intimately acquainted with the internal politics of that country, that had the suspension taken place sooner, the rebellion would never have burst forth. It was infinitely better to prevent guilt than to punish it.

If it had been proposed to him to give a decided affirmative or a decided negative to the motion for the suspension of the Habeas Corpus, he should certainly, with the knowledge of the circumstances of Ireland that he possessed, have preferred the former; but as a middle course had been offered to the house by the motion of an hon. bart. which went335to give them full information on the subject, he should most assuredly vote for the amendment. He differed materially from the hon. gent. who thought the situation of Ireland now the same as when the suspension of the Habeas Corpus had been voted by a parliament sitting in Ireland. To suppose this, would be to believe every argument that he had heard in favour of the union. No man was more disposed to pronounce an eulogy on that measure than he was; he had urged to his constituents, in the strongest terms, the full benefit which they would receive from a participation in the English constitution; but if a suspension were thus to take place on light grounds, or at any rate without serious inquiry, they would be apt to imagine that the benefits they derived from their close connection with England and English laws were not so great as he had represented them to be. There was another argument which appeared to him of some importance, and that was, that the suspension was confined to Ireland. If it were proposed to be extended over the whole kingdom he, for one, would make no opposition to it. It had been said, but without a shadow of truth, that the Irish gentry loved martial law better than magna charta.&#x2014;With regard to France, the situation of Ireland was essentially different from what it was at the time of the suspension that he had last alluded to. When the suspension took place, there was an organised republic existing in Ireland, and ready to fraternize with the then democratical govt. of France; but from the late change in the legislature and govt. of that country, all hopes of co-operation and assistance in their political views, that the republicans of Ireland might once have indulged, must long have vanished. If any living characters were more detested by the Irish than others, they were the individuals composing the self-denominated Irish directory in Paris.

{"date": ["1805", "jan", "15"], "content": "&#x2014;I do not rise, my lords, to disturb that unanimity by which I am aware it is so much to be wished the house should be actuated on a subject of so much importance as the present. When I heard his Majesty's most gracious speech read, so cordially did I agree in every sentiment expressed in it, that I did not think it would have been necessary for me to say a single word on the subject. Some observations, however, which have fallen from the two noble lords who moved and seconded the address, seem to require some explanation. I, for one, am anxious to enter my protest against the supposition, that in agreeing to the address as proposed, I thereby pledge myself on a subject as to which the house is not in possession of the facts necessary to enable them to form a judgment. I allude, my lords, to the war with Spain. On that subject, whatever may be my own private opinion, whatever I may know as an individual which may induce me to think that the conduct of the govt. of this country has been correct or otherwise, this house is not in possession of such parliamentary information as can warrant it at present in expressing any opinion on the subject. As, however, the subject has been started, though I think the noble lords would have acted more discreetly in waving it, I must be excused in saying a few words on that point. The noble lord who spoke last has said, that we were not bound to sit tamely by while the Spanish court were supplying our enemies with money and other requisites for waning against us. This I am by no means inclined to dispute. But then, my lords, it would have been but fair and reasonable, in order that a war might not unnecessarily be plunged into, that some precise requisition on the subject should have been made to the Spanish court, and a day fixed for them to give their decisive answer, before hostile measures had been resorted to. I am anxious to know if this has been the case. It is necessary not only that a thing should be fair, equitable, and justifiable in itself, but that the manner in which it is commenced should likewise be fair, just, and agreeable to the known and established law of nations. There is in one part of this business too, an occur-12rence of a very melancholy and deplorable kind, which, without imputing blame to any particular person, or at all inquiring into the immediate cause of the accident, I cannot help thinking might have been guarded against. If it was deemed fair and justifiable to detain the Spanish ships, might it hot have been so managed that they should have been met by a force of such superior magnitude, as to have made it not dishonourable in them to submit to the detention, rather than by one of such equal force, as would have entailed disgrace on them, had they surrendered without resistance? Again, if it was fair that ships of war having treasure on board should be detained, I am anxious to know where the policy or propriety could exist of allowing merchants' ships to pass unmolested? These, my lords, are some of the circumstances connected with the rupture with Spain, which appear to me to require explanation, and on account of which, I could not allow the address to pass, without stating that I by no means pledge\" myself to say, when the necessary papers are before the house, that I shall think that that business has been properly conducted.&#x2014; There is another part of the address which I cannot allow to pass without observation. It is said, that our army is on a respectable and formidable footing. This term our army was thought six months ago not to deserve, and under the administration of a noble lord (Sidmouth), it was strongly insisted that our army was greatly defective; nay, that was generally understood to have been the ground for that noble lord's retiring from office. It was not in one particular branch too, that this deficiency was said to exist, but in every department. The right hon. gent, who came in, promised us great things; and an act was passed, under his auspices, to effect this purpose. So far, however, from answering the end proposed, it is now allowed that this act has been found completely useless; indeed, a more ridiculous, absurd, and oppressive act, was never conceived. Scarcely a single soldier has been raised by it; nor is it calculated at all for that purpose. By what means, then, I should be glad to ask, has our state of defence, so defective under the noble lord's administration, become so respectable and effective under his right hon. successor's, without any aid but the ridiculous, absurd, and unproductive act to which I have just alluded?. But I suppose it will be insisted13by the right hon. gent. (Mr. Pitt), that every thing is now very well, and that there is nothing inefficient or defective in the govt. of the country. I beg it, however, to be understood, that in agreeing to the address, I do not mean to admit the respectability of the state of our army, whenever that shall become the subject of discussion.", "author_id": "/people/mr-frederick-howard-1", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},
{"date": ["1805", "jan", "15"], "content": "&#x2014;My Lords; I feel proper to trouble your lordships with a few observations, in consequence of a part of what has fallen from the noble earl. There never existed an occasion on which general unanimity could be more justifiably called for on the part of his Majesty's govt. than in the present moment. Upon the general sentiment, with respect to the leading topic in the communication from the throne, I trust no Englishman can entertain but one opinion. No doubt can exist as to the incumbent duty of using every exertion, under the present circumstances, to support the honour of his Majesty's crown, and the dignity of the country at large, in carrying on with vigour the important contest in which we are engaged, in order to bring it to an honourable and prosperous issue; such an issue as shall be consistent with the honour and dignity of this country, and the interests of these powers of Europe with whom we are connected by amity and good faith. Under such considerations alone can peace be deemed desirable, and whenever it can be secured upon such grounds, sensible I am, that it will be cheerfully embraced by his Majesty's govt. By too great an extent of concession, and by discovering too great an eagerness for negotiation, I fear it was, that we fell into the snare which led to the present war.&#x2014; The noble earl has particularly touched upon two points, though not, as I understood him, with a view of opposing the address. The first related to the question of the war with Spain, which the noble earl seems to think would have been unnecessary, were it not for some apprehensions which had fell from the noble mover of the address. In these, however, I imagine, that the noble lord must have been misunderstood, because he did not say any thing that implied a wish that the house should be committed beyond the simple specification in the address. We must, as the royal communication informs us, have the manifesto and the other official documents before us, ere we can properly give14any opinion upon the subject. His Majesty trusts that these papers will be duly-considered; and all that is proposed by the address is to say, that your lordship will consider the subject, coupled with an assurance that we are willing to support the dignity of the crown, and the interests of his Majesty's subjects. I heard nothing that fell from either of the noble lords which went to justify the inference of the noble earl. With the latter, however, I agree, that the subject should be considered in its various bearings of justice and policy; and though a particular line of conduct, if adopted by his Majesty's govt. may be fully warranted by the justice of the case, still, under the existing circumstances, it might not have been politic, and, in the former view, the question of war might have been brought to a short issue. When this important question comes to be discussed, I shall give my opinion as to the policy of entering into hostilities at the period to which I allude, and this I shall found upon the circumstances and facts of the case. There is, I admit, a third point of view, independent of both the former, in which the question may be considered, viz. how far, in the progress of the affair, the conduct of ministers may have been inconsistent with the honour of his Majesty's crown, or militate against that character for generous liberality, which is the distinguished characteristic of the British nation? On these considerations, however interesting or important, I shall forber to expatiate until the papers are regularly before the house; but it is proper your lordships should feel assured, that no disposition existed on the part of govt. to do that which may wear an appearance of rashness or precipitation; it is also important it should even now be understood, that the transaction alluded to, though justified by every principle of the law of nations, or of self-defence; is not necessarily connected with the situation in which the two countries are now relatively placed. I am happy in the opportunity of informing your lordships, that the point on which the noble earl's principal doubt seems to hang, was literally acted on in the very manner he himself has suggested. An explanation was demanded from the Spanish govt. and a particular day fixed for the final answer of that court. The explanation demanded by our govt. was refused; intimation of our resolution to detain their Ships was made;15our minister at Madrid had applied for passports; had obtained them, and had actually taken his departure, before the news of the capture of their, ships had reached Spain, I agree, however, with the noble earl, that both the justice and policy of the measure, and the mode in which it has been executed and carried through, are all subjects proper for investigation, but they will come to be judged of more properly when the necessary papers, are on your lordship's table.&#x2014;In regard to the state of the internal defence of the country, which forms the second part of the noble earl's animadversions, I will, without any reference to what has transpired on former occasions, venture to contend, that, considering the circumstances of the country at the period alluded to, a more formidable and effective military force has been constituted than was firmed at any corresponding period of any preceding war; and that the present state of our military preparations is positively unparalleled in the history of the country. It would be premature to go into minute details as to the state of the public force in the united kingdom, at this moment. I can, however, assure the noble earl, that in troops of the line, militia and volunteers, ready to take the field, it considerably exceeds 600,000 men; and that under the operation of an act of parliament passed the session before last, commonly called the army of reserve act, the disposable part of that force has been increased to an extent, and with a rapidity beyond all expectation, and has proved superior to every other expedient. Before I sit down, I cannot help expressing a sentiment of proud exultation, that after two years of war, in which the enemy has exhausted all his powers and resources to effect his determined purpose of invading our shores, he has been repelled by the menacing front which the vigour of this country has opposed to him. The spirit and zeal of the country never rose so high as it is at present, and that it has so risen, is owing to those blessings which every Englishman enjoys under the protection of our happy and glorious constitution.", "author_id": "/people/mr-robert-jenkinson", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},

The act by which it had been alledged that our army was to be rendered so completely effective, and by which such wonderful things were to have been produced, he also agreed with the noble earl in thinking absurd and ridiculous in the extreme, and completely inadequate to any good purpose, He hoped one of the first acts of the present session would be to repeal it.", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-hanover", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},

Not one jot of that discipline was he disposed to attribute tp their orders or management. On the contrary, it seemed rather to proceed from the activity of the inspecting officers, who were as competent to forward those returns which were alleged as one cause for the new appointments, as any generals whatever. On the whole, he had much doubt of the propriety of such various appointments for the volunteers as major-generals, brigadier? generals, and inspecting officers. If either of these could, with all its appendages, be dispensed with, it would form a253saving of expence that ought immediately to be attended to. For the purpose of volunteer discipline, he repeated, that those general officers were unnecessary; and for the purpose of returns, the inspecting officers would fully answer. The original appointment of such a number of generals arose, he was aware, from a blunder committed in the very outset of the volunteer system. From this blunder, a confusion was likely to arise in case the volunteers were called into action, upon the score of rank among the volunteer officers, and also in consequence of the incapacity of those officers to direct the Operation of a body of troops. To guard against such an effect, the appointment of some regular general officers to command the volunteers, but not by any means such a number as appeared in the estimate on the table, became advisable. The ex-pence incurred by this increased number, he admitted, was small, if the purpose for which the increase took place was great; but for such purposes as those described by the right hon. gent, it was much more than ought to arise.

To lessen, the arduousness of the task, and to trespass as little as possible upon the patience of the house, he should touch but very slightly on those parts of the subject in which no material difference of opinion existed between him and the right hon. gent, and confine himself principally to the points in which they were completely at variance. Of the former description was the character of the treaty of St. Ildefonso. The right hon. gent, had taken a great deal of pains and displayed a great deal of talent in proving what he was willing enough to admit&#x2014;that this treaty was clearly an offensive as well as a defensive one, and that if not renounced by Spain, or the conditions of it explained in an unambiguous manner, and one that should be completely satisfactory to this country, it indisputably became a just cause for declaring war against her. At the same time that. he made this ad* mission, he by no means agreed with the right hon. gent*in opinion, that the arguments urged by M. &#x101F;Anduaga in his explanation of the tendency of this treaty were so void of weight as he seemed to imagine. These arguments strongly evinced the desire of Spain to limit that which had originally an offensive meaning to one purely defensive, and could this construction of the treaty have been maintained, it might certainly have proved equally advantageous to both countries. In his own mind, he was most decidedly of opinion, that it was the true policy of this country to have remained on good terms with Spain. As far as he could collect it from the strange, uncertain, indistinct mass of documents, which had been laid before the house on this subject, it seemed at one period to have been the original opinion of govt. He thought it would have been the policy of this country to maintain a good understanding with Spain, although that country were to have allowed to France the contingent or the substituted pecuniary succours. In his opinion, the subsidy which the right hon. gent. in alluding to it, had considered as totally, out of the question, might have been acquiesced in with perfect safety and propriety, provided the other points on which he had387allowed we were entitled to expect satisfaction, had been explained in a manner calculated to remove all uneasiness on our part. Persons in the situation in which he was, were not able to procure all the necessary information; but he would contend, and he was convinced it would be allowed by every impartial man, that his maj.'s ministers possessing, as they must, the most extensive and multifarious information, flowing in upon them from a variety of sources, ought to have decided among themselves the question of the policy of preserving peace with Spain, and then have declared to that country, the exact boundaries of the neutrality beyond which it could not be allowed to pass.&#x2014;He would follow, or endeavour to follow the right hon. gent, through the intricate labyrinth of his arguments, as well as his recollection and his ability would permit. But he would take the liberty to remark previously on the strange fact, that, antecedent to the 2d of June not a single dispatch; appears from lord Hawkesbury to Mr. Frere, communicating to him instructions, by which his conduct to the court of Spain was to be regulated. It was strange too, and it seemed to him most highly culpable, at the time when hostilities commenced between this country and France, and when our govt. must have been fully acquainted with the connection that subsisted between France and Spain, that no attempts were made at that critical period to ascertain the real disposition of Spain, and to endeavour to fix her in a determination of neutrality. The first document to which the right hon. gent. had alluded in his speech was that memorable dispatch of lord. Hawkesbury to Mr. Frere, dated the 2d of June, 1803. He had been curious to hear how the right hon. gent, would defend that paper. We had been told by him, that it proved the vigilant attention of ministers by the precision with which it marked out to Mr. Frere, the line of conduct he should adopt. When he first read the title of this paper it was with great expectation, an expectation which was increased by the perusal of the two or three earlier paragraphs; but on looking still farther, some positive points having been staled with regard to the assistance demanded by France from Spain&#x2014;but he would read lord Hawkesbury's words, \"If the Spanish govt. should state to you that they Conceive themselves to be under the obligation to furnish to France the number of troops, and388ships which are stipulated in the treaty of St. Hdefonso, but that their co-operation will extend no farther\"&#x2014;What then? Here is a foreseen case&#x2014;had any thing arisen not foreseen, an opinion might have been directed to be withheld&#x2014;but here, upon this case, in which the circumstances that must influence a judgment are distinctly pointed out, lord Hawkesbury goes on to say, \"You will refrain from giving any Opinion upon this measure, but will content yourself with signifying, that you will transmit the information of it to your court.\" (See p. 62.) Mere is a satisfactory dispatch! It commences with professing to inform our minister how be is to act, and in continuation directs him to refer again to his own court. This truly was but a very inauspicious opening to this negotiation. So early ns the 3d of June, 1803, we find Mr. Frere beginning to detumid explanations in a note to M. Cevallos, and in a dispatch soon after to lord Hawkesbury, he mention's his answer. This, by the way, tie would observe, was one of the many communications, which but for the motion he had submitted to the house would never have been prod-aced on their table. Notwithstanding that motion, however, no dispatches had appeared from our govt. to Mr. Frere, between the 2d of June and the 24th of Nov. The right hon. gent. had endeavoured to shew that there were no circumstances during that period which required that fresh instructions should be sent to Mr. Frere; but this appeared to him to be by no means clearly established. it was surely very material, at a time when Spain was engaged in a negotiation with France, the avowed object of which was to settle the amount of the pecuniary succours which she was to contribute in lieu of the contingent of troops and vessels, that our minister at the court of Madrid should have been putts possession of the most ample and minute information of the way in which he should conduct himself to that court. Mr. Frere'S dispatches of the 5th and 15th of Aug. which were received on the V2th and 50th Sept. must have sufficiently apprised ministers of the urgent demands made by France on Spain, to furnish either the contingent or the pecuniary succours in lieu of ft. Was it not incumbent on our govt. He enter seriously into the discussion of this most important question, and to have communicated to Mr. Frere the result of their consultation, that fee might know de-389cidedly how to act? But instead of this, after hearing of the French negotiations at Madrid, the administration of this country sent not a single instruction to Mr. Frere, from the 2d to the 24th of Nov. but left him to conduct himself entirely at his own discretion. In that time he might have unadvisedly committed the country in the most serious and irrevocable manner. To him there appeared, in this interval, the most unpardonable remissness in the minister for the foreign department, a remissness which, in his mind, no explanation could extenuate.&#x2014;As the right hon. gent. had passed lightly over the circumstance of the conveyance of French troops through Spain to Ferrol, he would follow his example, although he had considerable doubts in his mind whether there existed any thing in that transaction which could be construed into a breach of neutrality.&#x2014;We now come to lord Hawkesbury's dispatch to Mr. Frere, dated 24th Nov. 1803, on the great importance of which the right on. Gent. dwelt with peculiar emphasis. This dispatch was occasioned by letters received from Mr. Frere, dated 9th and 11th Oct. in which the treaty between France and Spain is stated to be in the act of negotiating. The right hon. gent. had laid Considerable stress upon what he calls the precise instructions contained in this dispatch to Mr. Frere. To him the principles it contained appeared so intolerable, that the most violent infractions of the law of nations by that power, against whom the right hon. gent, had so frequently thundered his anathemas, were moderate in the comparison. He must in the first place, observe, that though lord Hawkesbury had been perfectly aware of the treaty carrying on between France and Spain, he had not previously insisted on any explanation of that treaty, or of the circumstance of the passage of French troops through Spain to Ferrol. In this dispatch of the 24th Nov. lard Hawkesbury thus expresses himself: \"The preservation of peace with Spain has, from the period of the commencement of the present war, been the constant object of his maj.'s policy, but the Spanish govt. must themselves feel that this object can only be attained by their earnest endeavours to do every thing which depends upon them for the maintenance for a fair system of neutrality, and by their causing that neutrality to he respected by the other be digerent powers. When the question390therefore occurs.\"&#x2014;The question had occurred, and lord Hawkesbury knew it had occurred&#x2014;\"When the question therefore occurs, how far his maj. would consent that the Spanish govt. should purchase their neutrality by an advance of pecuniary succours to the French govt. and would still regard them as neutrals, this must be considered as in some degree depending on the amount of the succours so to be advanced, and likewise on the determination of the Spanish govt. to insure their neutrality in all other respects; for, at the time, when his maj. might be disposed to disregard any small or temporary advance of money, if essential for the attainment of such an object, it would be impossible for him to consider a permanent advance to the extent of that stated by you, in any other light than as a subsidy to the French govt. and as possibly the most effectual assistance which the Spanish govt. could afford them for the prosecution of the war.\" &#x2014;What should naturally follow all this? Why, that if the terms were not agreed to, a declaration of war must ensue. Our govt. should have described with accuracy, the limits beyond winch they would not allow the conduct of Spain to pass, under the name of neutrality, and should have fully authorised their agent at the court of Madrid to declare war, should the conditions not be complied with. Lord Hawkesbury goes on: \"His maj. can only be induced to abstain from immediate hostilities in consequence of such a measure, upon the consideration that it is a temporary expedient from which the Spanish govt. are determined to extricate themselves as soon as possible, and that his maj. must be at liberty to consider a perseverance, in the system of furnishing pecuniary succours to France as, at any period, when circumstances may render it necessary, a just cause of war.\" &#x2014;The hon. gent. requested that gent, would attend particularly to this part of the question, as it was one of the most important in the whole discussion. If the principle contained in this dispatch was admitted, there would be an end at once of all public faith and national security. What is this principle? That having once a justifiable cause of war, explanations may be suspended, and a right reserved to go to war whenever convenience may require! Is this compatible with the good faith and national honour that the right hon. gent. so frequently talks of? If you once suspend, a cause of complaint, and do not at the391time make it a ground of immediate war, common justice and the law and practice of nations require that you must again bring that complaint under discussion be-.fore you declare war. Our ministers had assumed a great deal of generosity in their treatment of Spain, when, in fact, they had placed her in a situation worse than that of a hostile army in a truce. He called on gent, to say, whether this could be maintained? If the right hon. gent.'s arguments did not go to establish the principle he had repeated, he did not know to what they aimed. These instructions produced a new negotiation at Madrid between Mr. Frere and M. Cevallos. In one of Mr. Frere's dispatches, he laments the ignorance in which he is left by his court, and talks of the \"air of a superior information\" with which M. Cevallos addressed\" him, He sincerely sympathized in Mr. Frere's feelings on this occasion, and most decidedly condemned the conduct of the administration that had placed him in so auk-ward a predicament by their culpable neglect. In an account of a conference that Mr. Frere had with M. Cevallos, as related in the dispatch of the 27th Dec. in answer to the demand of the Spanish minister, \"whether the affording the pecuniary succours to France would be considered as a ground of war, and whether he was authorised to declare it,\" he says, \"that he was so authorised, and that war would be the infallible consequence.\" Where did Mr, Frere get this determined tone? Not in his instructions from lord Hawkesbury, for in them he is confined to \"protesting.\" It was very strange if he took it on himself to speak so decidedly without authority. Mr. Frere's note of the 13th Dec. contained demands for explanation on two points, the subsidy to Spain, and the admission of French troops into Spain, with a view to the danger of Portugal. M. Cevallos's answer states, that the pecuniary succours had been afforded to France, expressly to avoid hostilities with G. Britain; and he, cites a conference M. &#x101F;Anduaga had held with lord Hawkesbury, in which the English minister had not declared any objection to the furnishing of this equivalent. With regard to Portugal, he observes, that Spain had concerted measures for her security. Not satisfied with these explanations, Mr. Frere, on the 26th Dec. addressed a note to M. Cevallos, couched in terms of unaccountable boldness, in which he repeats his demands. In Mr. Frere's392note of the 18th Feb. though he knew the subsidiary treaty of Spain with France was concluded in Sept. he couples it with the armaments, and demands an ultimatum on these subjects in the most decided language. In spite of the sophistry of the rt. hon. gent, who had endeavoured to shew that there was no agreement between G. Britain and Spain, recognizing the neutrality of the latter power, yet what is there that can constitute an agreement if this does not? If in discussion you state certain conditions without which you will not agree, it is surely implied that if those conditions are not violated, the compact is formed. Now, in the conference that lord Hawkesbury had with M. &#x101F;Anduaga, this was precisely the case.&#x2014;In a subsequent dispatch Mr. Frere gives an account of two conversations with the prince of peace. He pressed several points which he afterwards made the subject of a formal note to the Spanish court, to which he received no answer, on which the right hon. gent, had commented most severely. If this answer was so dissatisfactory, why did not lord Hawkesbury see M. &#x101F;Anduaga and tell him so, and repeat to Mr. Frere his positive instructions? In a note to Mr. Frere from M. Cevallos, dated the 2Sd March, 1804, he adopts the language of Mr. Frere's note of the 18th Feb. and intimates that the British govt. had recognized the neutrality of Spain on certain terms. In the dispatch from Mr. Frere to lord Hawkesbury of the 18th April, in which this note is inclosed, he says, \"as there is nothing \"in any note of mine which could be \"brought forward as a foundation for \"such a conclusion, I have not thought \"it worth while to enter any protest in \"answer to M. Cevallos's insinuation,\" (see page 91.) It certainly was Mr. Frere's duty to protest against this assertion; it was his duty, for the sake of his own credit, for the honour of his country, and for the security of Spain. The hon. gent. said, he could not express his indignation at his conduct, in not doing so in language sufficiently strong, to do justice to his feelings. If we recur, said he, to the course of proceedings between man and man, this doctrine will forcibly apply. I am at law with a man who does not, however, wish any longer to remain so, provided I grant him certain terms. I acquiesce. I am not to, molest him unless he violates those terms. Our disputes are to be adjusted amicably. But when I find him off his guard, his pre-393parations discontinued, council dispersed, witnesses, gone each his way, himself reposing in unsuspecting security, up I lift my arm, or violently wield the arm of the law, and crush the poor man to death. Is this honour? Is this justice? And yet much of such a complexion is the transaction with Spain. Mr. Frere had by his plighted pledge got Spain to disarm, but a principle is reserved, and now is acted upon, of going to war with Spain the moment it suited our convenience so to do. But to this remissness, which in this case attached to Mr. Frere, and during the whole of the negotiation to lord Hawkesbury, was to be attributed the war in which we were plunged, and the dishonour with which our national character was stained. In M. &#x101F;Anduaga's note, the terms on which it was imagined the British govt. would consent to the observance of neutrality were distinctly stated; if to these terms lord Hawkesbury made no objection, the inference was clear that they were consented to. From Jan. 21 to the time lord Hawkesbury went out of office, no dispatches appeared. At that period a \"faction,\" as the noble lord called it, (see vol. 2. p. 342), combined; the administration was amended much in the same way as bills were sometimes amended in that house, and to carry on the simile, he hoped that house would soon exercise the power of repealing it. Thus did Lord Hawkesbury remove without another word, retaining no doubt, in his dying moments the most pacific dispositions; at least there did not exist a single line farther to disapprove of such a disposition, and it was probable that the old proverb,\" silence gives consent,\" was verified in this case. Then began lord Harrowby's administration; in the first part of which a similar remissness prevailed, which was afterwards aggravated by steps of the most unjustifiable haste and violence.&#x2014;With regard to the order given by lord Harrowby to admiral Cochrane, on his receiving intelligence that the Spanish fleet was arming in Ferrol, to blockade that port, it was perfectly justifiable. Two dispatches existed of the date of the 29th Sept. from lord Harrowby to Mr. Frere; one containing ostensible, the other private instructions, both warranting him to break off negotiation, and quit' Madrid, if his demands for the disarming the Spanish ships were not complied with. To the note which Mr. B. Frere addressed on this sub-394ject, to the Spanish govt. he received what he chooses to term an unsatisfactory answer, but which certainly contains as complete a satisfaction as language can convey. It stated that whatever information the British govt. might have received, yet-that the armament had been but trifling, and that it should cease. In fact it had ceased at that time. That Mr. B. Frere thought this reply satisfactory, appears clearly from his remaining at Madrid which otherwise he could not have done without disobeying his instructions. On the 2Sth Sept. Mr. Frere received instructions to make further representations on the subject of armaments; that is on what no longer existed. He did so, and the reply was an utter disclaiming of all armaments injurious to G. Britain, stating the improbability of such a thing after the agreement by which the neutrality of Spain had been acknowledged by G. Britain. Mr. Frere then, for the first time, denies the existence of any such agreement, or recognizance, though in a letter to lord Harrowby he had spoken of it, and he asserts the monstrous proposition that G. Britain has a right to declare war on any armament that Spain may make, for whatever purpose. He then required that the Spanish ships should be placed on the same footing on which they were before the convention, and on no account that any addition should be afterwards made to them. In the refusal of Spain to comply he demanded his passports. Surely Mr. Frere must have exceeded the bounds to which his instructions authorized him to proceed; there was no cause for his abrupt proceeding, unless in the interim he received advice of the unfortunate event of the seizure of the Spanish frigates: an event indeed doubly unfortunate, first in the loss of so many innocent human beings; and secondly, in the idelible stain on British good faith and honour. At length passports were granted to Mr. Frere's urgent and repeated requests, and so the negotiation ended. The hurry with which Mr. Frere quitted Madrid, and the unwillingness he evinced to receive any further explanation, reminded him of a scene in the Rivals, where Sir Lucius O'Trigger, in a dispute in which his friend Acres is engaged, shuts his ears to all accommodation, exclaiming, \"It is a very pretty quarrel as it stands, and if you say any more you will only spoil it.\"&#x2014;He had shewn how much blame attached to ministers for their395indecision in an early part of the negotiation, as to their true policy with regard to Spain, and for their shameful reserve to that country with respect to their intentions; but the last violent outrage committed in the seizure of the frigates, filled up the measure of their iniquity. On the very day that the govt. had received advices from admiral Cochrane, stating the armaments at Ferrol, did they give these unjust and infamous orders. He should feel himself gratified by learning whether the Spaniards did not give the most satisfactory references as to the armaments in their ports. They affirmed, in the first place, that the armaments were not intended to be employed against this country, and to other remonstrances that they had no longer any existence. As this explanation was given, why was the discussion on the other point be abruptly terminated? If an accredited minister was to be sent to Madrid, why could not ministers have waited till his arrival at Madrid,\" instead of giving those precipitate orders which had produced such lamentable effects? It could not be seriously urged that Spain meant any thing hostile to this country. Her internal and political situation refuted the idea. Spain, almost verging to political dissolution, wasted by pestilence, and scourged by a devouring famine, could entertain no idea of hostility against a country with which it has so many powerful ties of interest. The very ports where the preparations were stated to be, tended to shew that no hostilities on a great scale were intended. Was it credible that at Carthagena, where thousands were expiring of a pestilential and loathsome disease, there were any views of a hostile nature entertained? Mr. Duff's reports in July and Aug. likewise shewed that there were at Cadiz no preparations of a formidable description. The ships were in general old and crazy, and the arsenals were destitute of stores of all sorts. There was no wood but the country pine, and no contract had been formed for procuring supplies from the Baltic. Without attaching any blame to admiral Cochrane, for whom he thought the highest respect ought to be entertained, he could not help saying, that top much stress had been, without inquiry, laid on his statements. The feelings of nature, as veil as the habits of his profession, might have led him to give too highly coloured a picture of the state of the naval preparations in Spain. There was an officer in396the house, the captain of the Malta, whose opinion he should have wished produced on the present occasion. That officer had been on the Ferrol station, and could give very important information to the house. At all events the matter was one very fit to be inquired into. But had ministers made such an inquiry previous to the issuing of orders for seizing the Spanish frigates? They certainly had not; nay, he was not quite sure that even a cabinet council was convened on the business. He was almost inclined to think that lord Melville had taken on himself the responsibility of issuing the orders in question. Was this, he asked, a decent, honourable mode of proceeding? Was it fair treatment to a nation, anxious for our friendship, and compelled to stoop under the rod of an unfeeling despot? It was in vain that explanations were offered, and that assurances of neutrality were given by the Spanish govt. Indeed there was much of the appearance of a wish to come to a rupture. The abrupt and precipitate departure of Mr. Frere had very much of that appearance. In defence of the seizure of the Spanish frigates, it was described as a measure of precaution. This he denied, for it was a direct measure of war. While a dispute was pending betwixt two countries, they had both a right to take measures of precaution. If one nation ordered their army to be augmented, the other had a right to order a similar increase in its military establishment. If the one increased its navy, the other might be bound in prudence and policy to place its naval force on a more enlarged footing. If the Spaniards had preparations in their ports, we had a fair right to watch the motions of their ships, but we had no right to seize their ships, their persons, and their goods, without even an appearance of a declaration of war. It was an act uprincipled and atrocious in the highest degree, and calculated to degrade the character of the country at a time when it was so important to stand high in the opinion of Europe as the defender of its liberties against lawless dominion. And now, said the hon. gent, having gone over most of the ground of the right hon. gent, having admitted the hostile character of the treaty of St. Hdefonso, but deprecated the abuse of the principle of war which that treaty yielded; having shewn that we abandoned our claim to the right, substituting the recognition of a neutrality; having demonstrated, at least to my own conviction397that Spain has not violated her neutrality; having proved the pacific dispositions of Spain, and that there were no armaments carrying on against G. Brit, in the ports of that power; having clearly established that the order of 18th of Sept. and the consequent seizure of the Spanish frigates, were not measures of precaution, but of violence, injustice, and bad faith, I shall now conclude by moving the following amendment to the address moved by the right hon. gent.&#x2014;\"To return his maj. the thanks of this house for the communications made to us relative to the rupture with Spain. To express our entire conviction that the existence of a defensive treaty between France and Spain would have entitled his maj. to consider Spain as a principal in the present war unless the obligations of that treaty were renounced, or their execution disclaimed; and to assure his maj. that we shall at all times be ready to support him in giving effect, so far as the interests of his dominions may require, to this just and undisputed principle.&#x2014;That we observe, however, that his maj. was-advised to wave the exercise of this right, in order-to negotiate with Spain, for the maintenance of her neutrality. And that, without taking upon ourselves -in the present moment to decide a question of policy depending so much on circumstances of which we are still uninformed, we acknowledge with gratitude this proof of his maj.'s paternal desire to have prevented the further extension of the calamities of war.&#x2014; But that we beg leave humbly to represent to his maj. that the execution of these his benevolent wishes indispensably required from his ministers the adoption of some just, intelligible, and uniform principles of negotiation, declared in the outset with frankness, and steadily pursued to its conclusion; followed up by an unremitting attention to every new circumstance-arising in tie progress of so important a discussion; and, accompanied by the most scrupulous care that all engagements resulting from it should, on the part of G. Brit, be defined with precision, and-performed with unquestionable good faith, moderation, and integrity.&#x2014;Tha!t we have on the contrary, seen with regret in the whole conduct of this transaction, the clashing effects of undecided, equivocal, and contradictory policy. That the wishes for peace professed in the outset by his maj.'S ministers, have uniformly been conteracted by their studious398endeavours to keep alive both the cause and the menace of war; a purpose equally inconsistent with justice and with wisdom, destructive of all confidence on the part of the power with whom they treated, and incompatible with the object for which they were negotiating. That during the whole course of those discussions, while they were continually soliciting from Spain unreserved communications on points of mutual interest, their own indecision prevented them in return from returning a distinct statement of the terms on which G Brit, would consent to recognize the neutrality of that power. That their ground of negotiation was repeatedly shifted, their demands varied, and their concessions undefined; and that although some agreement appears-at last to have been concluded, neither its date, nor its conditions were ascertained with precision; yet, both are repeatedly referred to, by the British, as well as the Spanish ministers, and the breach of those very conditions is all edged as the motive on the part of G. Brit, for her actual commencement of hostilities.&#x2014;That the omissions and defects which distinguish those transactions, as well as the fatal consequences to which it has led, can only be ascribed to the erroneous principle on which it was grounded, and to the criminal and almost incredible negligence with which it has been conducted. That it is particularly our duty to represent to his maj. that in a negotiation for peace or war between G. Brit. and Spain, carried on principally at Madrid, no instructions were sent to his maj.'s minister at that court, from the 2d of June to the 24th of Nov. in the year 1803; from thence to the 21st of Jan. in. the year following; not again from that date to the 29th of Sept. That in the first of these intervals, being little less than 6 months, the negotiation for a treaty of neutrality between France and Spain was begun, continued, and concluded; yet not the smallest intimation was, in that long time, given to Mr. Frere, of the light in which that negotiation was considered here; of the language it was proper for him to hold; or of the measures it might be necessary for him to take; although frequent communications were made to him on the subject, by the Spanish govt. who appear to have been disposed to pay great attention in this instance to any representation from G. Brit.&#x2014;That during the last of the above mentioned periods, the same minister though left again for many months without any instructions399whatever, negotiated and concluded some agreement with Spain on this most important subject, of which agreement no opinion was ever expressed to him from hence, either before or after its conclusion; nor does it even now appear, from any official documents, whether the same was meant to be allowed or disallowed, ratified or rejected, by the Brit. govt.&#x2014;That we feel ourselves compelled to express to his maj. that in the farther progress of these transactions, the indecision and neglect of his govt. were succeeded by precipitate resolutions and acts of violence equally injurious to the honour and interest of his kingdom. &#x2014;That we should have applauded any endeavour by firm and temperate representation to extricate our relations with Spain from the confusion in which they had been involved, and to bring them to a distinct issue of acknowledged neutrality or decided war, but that we find no trace of any such attempt. And that in the middle of Sept. on the first intimation of supposed movements in the Spanish ports, acts of hostility were decided on by his maj.'s govt. previous to all complaint, and executed without notice during a period of amicable negotiation.&#x2014;That the dispositions of Spain appear, from the information of his maj.'s minister at Madrid, to have continued up to that moment friendly to G. Brit, and that the conduct of his maj.'s ministers, in having, under such circumstances, anticipated all explanation by concealed orders for an attack on Spanish ships, property, and subjects, cannot be justified on any ground of public law, much less reconciled to those principles of moderation and liberality which belong to the British character, and which in the present situation of Europe is peculiarly the duty of this country to maintain inviolate. &#x2014;That on reviewing the discussions which immediately preceded the present war, we cannot but represent to his maj. the essential difference between the conduct of the person left in charge of his maj.'s affairs at Madrid, and the tenor of the only instructions under which he appears to have acted. That the explanations given to that gent. by the Spanish govt. though not in all points adequate to the just expectations of this country, were yet such as ought manifestly (according to those instructions) to have determined him to wait at Madrid for the arrival of an accredited minister authorized by his maj. to arrange with that court all points of difference. And that400we have therefore seen with equal surprise and indignation the final decision of his maj.'s ministers, not only to adopt the inconsiderate resolution taken by the king's representative in withdrawing himself from Madrid, but also to treat with utter disregard the subsequent offer from the Spanish minister at this court to pursue the same discussions here; an offer which, if accepted, might probably have led to a satisfactory conclusion on matters upon which the two courts were so nearly agreed. That while we have thus thought it our duty to represent to his maj. the errors of his ministers in the conduct of this important transaction, and the fatal consequences which have resulted from them, we beg leave to repeat our humble assurance that we are ready to support his maj. to the utmost in every measure necessary to assert the rights and vindicate the honour of his crown, objects which can never be successfully pursued by negligent and undecided councils, nor attained by the violation of engagements on which those with whom we treat have rested their security.\"&#x2014;The amendment being read, and the question put,", "author_id": "/people/mr-charles-grey-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

{"date": ["1805", "feb", "04"], "content": "after all the information which the papers already moved for contained, still expressed himself of opinion that there were several important deficiencies to be supplied, and points of the highest consequence to be explained. The deficiencies at present existing, were of papers from the office of the sec, for the foreign department, and the board of admiralty. Of the latter he should, at present, say nothing, because all the papers he had moved for were not yet produced, and till they were on the table, he could not ascertain to what extent the deficiency of evidence existed. As to the deficiencies from225the sec. of state's office, he had to offer a few observations. What, in the first place, he wished to ascertain, was, whether, previous to the 2d June, down to the 24th Nov. there existed any papers illustrative of the steps taken by our ministers to obtain any satisfactory explanation of the treaty of St. Ildefonso. He was also anxious to know whether, during the long interval betwixt the 21st Jan. and the 29th Nov. no instructions whatever were given by Lord Hawkesbury, or the person who succeeded him in the office of foreign sec. to our minister at Madrid, on the subjects in dispute betwixt the two countries. If no such instructions were given, it was fit that this should be stated to the house. If, on the other hand, instructions were given, it was proper that the house should be in possession of them to enable them to form a fair judgment of the whole of this very extraordinary negotiation. On a former day he had moved for a copy of all information received of the passage of French troops through the Spanish territories, referred to in Mr. Frere's dispatch of the 9th Sept. It was quite clear, that in consequence of the remonstrances of our minister, the future passage of French troops through Spain was prevented; but while this was admitted, it was equally evident that some explanations took place on the subject. Now, it was very important for the house to know what these explanations Were; but the house had hitherto no information on the subject. The existence of these explanations was indeed sufficiently evident, from references in the dispatches of the 24th Nov. but the house knew not in what spirit they were couched, or to what extent they proceeded. Respecting the convention alluded to in the correspondence, he was now convinced that what the right hon. gent. opposite (Mr. Pitt) had stated, was correct; that such an agreement between the govt. of Spain and this country had no existence. But it was quite as manifest that the Spanish govt. did, in consequence of what had taken place in various conferences with our minister, suppose that their neutrality was to depend on certain understood conditions. In various parts of the correspondence it appeared that ministers had made various demands for a copy of the treaty by which Spain was to furnish subsidiary resources to France. He wished to be informed whether ministers were ever in possession of an official Copy of this document. The knowledge of226this fact was highly interesting, because it would be possible to form an estimate, whether the terms of it differed widely from those terms on which, in the, first instance, our forbearance was founded; whether it was materially contrary to the principles on which there was a chance of the preservation of Spanish neutrality; or whether Spain, at the time the rupture took place, had shewn any disposition to alter her conduct in any way likely to affect the interests of this country? It was not attempted to be denied, in the papers already on the table, that very important conferences had taken place betwixt the Spanish ambassador here, and the sec. for the foreign department. The chev. d'Anduaga alluded to the conferences in various parts of his dispatches. It was fair to presume, not only that these conferences were highly interesting, but it was not at all unlikely that the principal part of the discussion that took place was committed to writing. The Spanish ambassador spoke in his dispatches of explanations Which these conferences produced, and it would surely be very strange indeed, if the sec. for the foreign department never communicated any part of the discussions to our minister at Madrid, as affording him a rule for the regulation of his conduct in the course of the various discussions which took place on all the points in dispute. From the Chev. d'Anduaga's dispatches of the 3d Aug. it was quite undeniable that the conferences of the 29th and 30th Aug. involved matters of the highest consequence. In the whole of that dispatch, it was plain that his excl. viewed them in that light, and it was not less obvious, that in a similar light he had represented them to his court. If he attached so much consequence to them, was it presuming too much to suppose that they must have been at least equally interesting to our minister at Madrid? It was next to an impossibility that he should have been left altogether ignorant of their principal importance; but not a word of what had taken place betwixt Lord Hawkesbury, his successor, and the Spanish ambassador, appeared in the papers already on the table. The house, however, ought not to be kept in the dark, respecting any part of so interesting a business; and he certainly did think, that if any documents connected with these conferences were in existence, they ought to be produced. He should therefore feel it his duty to move for the production of all227the notes which might have been presented at these different conferences to which the Spanish ambassador refers in various parts of his dispatches, and on which he appears to lay peculiar stress, as if in these the terms of the Spanish neutrality had been in a great measure adjusted. He next wished to call the attention of the house to the two notes of the Spanish minister on the 4th and the 11th of Nov. in which he gives an official explanation of the state of the Spanish armaments. It was important for the house then to know what was the information on which ministers proceeded when the orders for the detention of the Spanish frigates were issued. It was material to compare the intelligence received from our naval officers abroad, with the solemn assurances and explanations given by the Spanish ambassador resident at our court. Till this information was before the house, it was impossible to determine how far these orders were or were not called for by the actual state of things. If ministers had any such information, the house had a right to demand it. If ministers had no such information, it was not at all very doubtful what opinion ought to be entertained of them for issuing the orders. The hon. member also expressed a desire to have all letters or dispatches which took place from February to May 1804, produced. It was fair to presume that letters of an important kind were written during that interval. In the letter of the 1st of May, a letter of the 18th of Feb. is referred to, and he wished to have that letter produced, as affording some explanation of the manner in which any expectation of the continuance of Spanish neutrality could be preserved. He had thought it his duty to throw out these observations, not with the view of embarrassing govt. but solely with the object of coming, with full information, to the discussion of a subject which he could not help considering one of the most momentous which ever was submitted to the decision of the house of commons. As to deficiencies from the board of admiralty, he should at present say nothing, till he had an opportunity of seeing whether the papers he had moved for were satisfactorily produced.", "author_id": "/people/mr-charles-grey-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1805", "feb", "04"], "content": "strongly contended for the importance of having such explanations as look place at different conferences alluded to in the dispatches laid before the house. The explanations contained in the conferences of the 9th and the 30th of March, must, from the language of the letter of the 1st of May, have been highly interesting, and ought, by all means, to be produced. The chanc. of the excheq. had indeed stated, that mere notes, presented by an ambassador, perhaps merely offering a private opinion, and not authorized by his court, could not afford any information to the house. He, for his part, begged leave to argue that this was not a fair view of the subject. It was not possibe to conceive from the language of the Spanish ambassador, when alluding to explanations which had taken place at conferences, that he delivered in unauthorized notes. It was, on the contrary, quite evident that he alluded to authorized explanations, in which he laid down the principles and views of his court. It was impossible to believe that the notes which passed on such occasion were uninteresting. The presumption was certainly directly the reverse, and the house ought to have an opportunity of exercising their judgment on the subject. He was therefore anxious for the production, of all such explanations as would tend to229throw light on this most interesting subject. There was in the perusal of the papers a circumstance which puzzled him considerably, and which required a good deal of explanation. Our minister, Mr. Frere, in a letter of the 12th of Nov. stated, that in consequence of some discussions with the prince of peace, he should demand a conference. Now it was a matter of some consequence to ascertain whether ever this conference took place, and if it did take place, what was the result of it, or what explanation it produced. It was hardly to be supposed that it should not have been demanded after Mr. Frere, in a letter to the sec. for the foreign department, had expressed an opinion of its expediency.

In the course of the last session, the house thought fit to order a great variety of papers to be laid before them, to explain the causes of the war which began in 1803, against two of the principal Mahratta chiefs, Scindia and Boosla. By the papers before the house it appears, that those chiefs were subdued and reduced to submission, and that treaties of peace had been signed with them about the close of the same year; and it was natural to conclude that there was an end of the war in India. Nothing could be more improbable than that any of the remaining Mahratta powers should take up the contest, where49the others had left it; and especially against an enemy flushed with success, and which the greatest powers of the Mahratta empire had not been able to resist. Neverthless it is known, that another war with another chief, called Holcar, immediately, or soon after, succeeded to the pacification with Scindia and Boosla. I consider it as the final act of the same transaction, and that the information before the house would not be complete without the papers relative to these last hostilities, which I propose to move for. I hold it to be of importance to the good govt. and safety of our possessions in India, that a regular communication of all material transactions should, at proper intervals, be made to parliament, and that the record of them should be preserved in this house. I have no doubt that Holcar has been subdued; his force, compared with ours, is so inconsiderable, that one can only wonder at his venturing, at such a time especially, to provoke a quarrel with a power so much superior to him. Nevertheless he has certainly been able to make some resistance, and we know that many lives have been lost already in the course of this petty war. In one of the provinces ceded to us, called Bundalcund, a party of his cavalry surrounded a detachment of ours, consisting of two complete companies of sepoys, some cannon, and fifty European artillerymen, every man of whom were cut to pieces. The loss of the sepoys is to be lamented; that of the artillery-men is invaluable. The main body, from which this little force was detached, immediately retired, and the officer who commanded it was put under arrest. I need not say more to prove that these transactions deserve the attention of the house. I am not aware of any reasonable objection to the motion, but if any should be made, I hope the house will permit me to reply to it. I move you, sir, \"That there be laid before this house, copies or extracts of all letters or correspondence received from India, since the last session of parliament, relative to hostilities between the British govt. and a Mahratta chief, called Jesswunt Rao Holcar, and the causes thereof, as far as may be consistent with the public service, and with the good faith due to persons from whom secret intelligence may have been received.\"&#x2014;Before I sit down, I wish to mention a subject connected with the Mahratta war, on50which the house has received no information. I expected to find it explained in the printed papers, but in them there is no mention of it. In the country of Guzzerat, to the north west of Bombay, there is a prince called the Gwicowar: a part of his territory has been ceded to the company, partly to make good the pay of our subsidiary force stationed at Poona, and for no other objects of indemnification. Out of that fund we ought to have received a considerable revenue; but to that prince the govt. of Bombay have lent a sum not much less than 360,000l. The documents relative to this extraordinary transaction, I think, ought to have been laid before the house under the orders already given, which would save time and trouble; if not, it must be the subject of a particular motion.", "author_id": "/people/sir-philip-francis", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

But on no occasion did he say, that this suspension should continue always; for when he supported it on the spur of the moment, his support was founded both upon necessity and notoriety. He had now no ground or information before him, to shew that this measure was bottomed either in one or the other. He now wanted the notoriety, and had reason to think and believe, that since the passing of the act now in force, a great change had taken place in the minds and dispositions of the people of Ireland. Here there was no information brought forward, no danger was made apparent, no necessity shewn, no notoriety established, and yet the house was called upon to pass this act of suspension of the liberties of the people of Ireland, as it were by acclamation, and with no more than twenty-four hours notice. He admitted, as was done by the noble lord who moved the amendment, that the measure might be necessary, but there was no proof of it. There was some reason for it in the former instance; he thought there was reason for it; but the ministers did not think proper to give them they now.

A bill of this description was not to be treated as lightly as a vote of credit. With regard to the secrecy so much contended for, and the danger and inconvenience said to attend enquiry, was there not considerable danger and inconvenience in exposing the affairs of the Bank of England, and yet a committee had been some time ago appointed to investigate and make a report on that subject. Why should the people of Ireland be treated with less ceremony? As to the character of the lord lieutenant and his secretary, it made no legislative ground for so severe a measure as the present. He never knew a lord lieutenant in that country who was not represented as a very amiable man. He never heard of a secretary who was not said to be possessed of the highest talents, and overflowing with humanity and benevolence.

Lord Folkstone here called the hon. and learned gent. to order, on the ground of his allusions being irregular. After some conversation, the hon. member proceeded to observe, that the arguments against the suspension of the Habeas Corpus, drawn from the deficiency of glaring instances, as stated by some hon. members, might be met by an illustration of an opposition of the same nature, which illustration was made by a right hon. gent. a few years back (Mr. Windham) who mentioned the case of the captain of a ship who went on a voyage round the world, and had provided himself with certain ventilators, and other machines of a useful description. \"I laid out my money,\" said the captain, \"for nothing, for I have not had a sick man during the whole of my voyage.\" The hon. gent. then alluded to the miseries which Ireland had suffered, and which had left her in a state of trouble; miseries which could not have been overcome, but by that system of vigour which had been adopted by administration. With respect to the measure now opposed by the hon. gentlemen on the other side, he should not wish to go farther back than the period of the revolution, to shew the manner in which such suspensions had been proposed and received in that house. In the first year of King William III. the deliverer of this country from tyranny, the Habeas Corpus was suspended, without any particular case, or any previous examination before parliament. A message was sent down from the throne, and it was stated, that his majesty's government found it necessary to arrest some suspected persons, but that they were met in their way by the528Habeas Corpus Act. The king's word was taken for granted, and the motion passed. In 1707, and 1715, it was also suspended without any examination. In 1722, no case was made out; it was stated in the speech from the throne, that a dangerous conspiracy existed in the country; this was answered by parliament by an address, and the bill of suspension passed the next day. The result of all the precedents was, that it was not usual to establish the facts by evidence before the house of commons. It was only necessary, that the house should have a general belief as to their existence. Could any man open his eyes, and not perceive that the measure was necessary? As to the duration of time proposed by the noble lord, he should oppose it, because, if the suspension was only to continue six weeks, it might as well not take place at all.

He would not pretend to say there was no possible case that could exist in which the house could be warranted to adopt such a bill without enquiry, as certainly a case might occur in which the notoriety of public danger was so palpable to every man as to supercede all necessity for enquiry: but did such a case exist at this moment? If it did exist, it must exist in the dark; and if there was sedition in the country, it must be secret; and before the house was called upon to pass a bill for suspending so important a branch of the constitutional law towards the people of Ireland, it was incumbent upon those who brought it forward, to prove that necessity, and upon the house to go into enquiry, before it was induced to adopt the measure. If danger or sedition did lurk in any part of Ireland, it did not follow, that a measure of so much severity ought, therefore, to attach upon the whole country. But his maj.'s ministers had adduced no proof that the mischief had existence in any part of that country. Without due proof of such evil existing, the house was called upon to refuse the measure; and if any ill consequence should occur from such refusal, the blame ought not to attach upon parliament, but upon his maj.'s ministers, who shall not have brought forward the proofs necessary to justify parliament in passing such a law.

Depend upon it the danger exists. Depend upon it the powers conveyed by this bill will not he abused in the lenient hands of the present Chief Governor of Ireland.\" But was this, he would ask, the language for ministers to hold to parliament, or upon which that house would feel itself warranted to act, for the suspension of, the constitutional liberties of the people of475Ireland? He trusted such a species of unproved representation would never be admitted by that house as a justification for placing the liberties of his maj.'s subjects at the arbitrary disposal of any individual, however respectable; and no man entertained higher personal respect for, or a more exalted opinion of the lenient character of the noble lord at the head of the Irish govt. than he did. But it was not in the power of one or two individuals at the head of affairs to attend to every particular case throughout the whole extent of Ireland, especially when all the passions of individuals were alive, and personal animosity was seeking to wreak its private revenge by means of aggravated and frequently unfounded crimination. Could these one or two upright individuals in the situation in which they were placed, apply to every case the same impartial justice, and the same fair examination which would be given by a jury of 12 men deciding on all the circumstances? It was impossible they could, and yet this was the sort of substitution which the house was called upon to sanction without any inquiry whatsoever. It was matter of notoriety, that, even under the mild and moderate administration of the Marquis Cornwallis, characterised as it so eminently was by caution, by deliberation, and by lenity, yet many persons suffered punishment under existing prejudices, misrepresentation, or false proofs, whose innocence was afterwards fully demonstrated; as was instanced in the case of the Rev. Mr. O'Neil, of Youghall, the mention of whose very severe sufferings did so much honour, on a former occasion, to the feelings of a right hon. member who noticed the subject. Numbers of cases were also extant, even in the history of this country, to shew that arbitrary power had rarely been placed in the hands of individuals without being abused; and even going no farther than the administration of theAlien Bill, how many hundreds of innocent individuals have suffered, even with the best intentions of his maj.'s ministers, through the false or malicious misrepresentation of enemies. And if such abuses could occur in dispensing a law to a few aliens, how much greater was the liability of such abuses under a law attaching upon the millions that compose the population of Ireland.

It was for the want of such power in the hands of the magistrates that year, that sedition had gone such lengths, and that sedition would again gather new strength, if not timely prevented, by renewing those powers' which were not likely to be abused in such hands as those of the nobleman now at the head of the Irish govt. the moderation and lenity of whose measures had shone so eminently conspicuous.

He appealed for the truth of this statement to an hon. bart. opposite (sir John Newport), who had delivered his sentiments on the subject on a former evening. Such, he was convinced, was the existing necessity which called for this bill, in many parts of Ireland, that numbers of those who had been formerly most clamorous against it, were now most477earnestly anxious for its adoption; and so far from being deemed a grievance by the loyal inhabitants of the country, nothing more acceptable to them could be done than to pass this bill.", "author_id": "/people/mr-richard-ker-2", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

He did not deny that there were appearances of disaffection in some parts of Ireland, but he never could admit the principle, that because one part of a kingdom was deficient in the duty they owed to their king and country, the whole kingdom was to be placed beyond the pale of the common law of the land. He was aware of the proceedings to which the hon. member alluded, but he thought that they afforded no reason whatever for the measure now before the house. The fact was, that the principal offenders in the county of Waterford were now actually in gaol and liable to be tried by the judges of assize. It was not therefore to be argued, that the proceedings referred to offered even an excuse for a bill which had a tendency to place the whole people of Ireland beyond the protection of the common law. On a former day he had not argued that the measure in question was unnecessary, but what he called for was an inquiry to demonstrate its necessity. Nothing short of a notoriety extreme and uncontradicted, could, in his opinion, justify this measure, and conceiving that this necessity had not been made out, he had moved an amendment, the object of which was to institute that inquiry, by which only a fair decision of the house could be formed.

He began by apologising for preventing any gent. from being heard, but upon so momentous a question he was anxious to deliver his sentiments at as early an hour as possible, being conscious that when the patience of the house was at all exhausted, he could not hope to engage that attention, which others of greater experience and known talents could command at any period of the-debate, however advanced. Although the right lion. gent. who opened the debate, and those who followed him in support of the address, had thought fit conveniently for the purpose of their argument, to consider this question as embracing only one topic of discussion, to those who attentively considered it, as it appeared to him, it must obviously present itself in two points of view; the one, whether supposing an apparent ground of complaint to have been laid, under all the circumstances of the case, it was consistent with sound policy to involve this country in a war with Spain; the other, whether the manner of commencing hostilities can be justified. The latter, with the leave of the house, he should take the liberty of examining first, as being by far the most important, in as much as it involved in its consideration up less a question than that of national honour. And he must confess, that so far from thinking the mode in which hostilities were commenced justifiable, he alluded of course to the attack upon the Spanish frigates, to him it appeared little better than an act of piracy. This was no doubt a grave charge, and ought not to be imputed on light grounds, but if he had the good fortune to convey intelligibly to the house that which had impressed complete conviction upon his own mind, viz. that it was not warranted by any sound precedent to be found in all political history, that it was a violation of the national faith implicitly pledged, and that it was contrary to, the express letter and spirit of the law of nations, he should go pretty far towards proving, if not the whole length of proving, that the act was little better than piratical. With regard to the precedents, he believed he might safely challenge those who supported the other side of the question to traverse the whole range of universal history so far as regards the practice of civilized nations; certain he was, he could boldly defy them to ransack our own history for a single instance of acknowledged authority upon which the act in412question, either in the comparison of circumstances, or upon the ground of analogy, could fairly be said to be justified. He was not unmindful of the several oases, cited by the hon. and learned gent. (the king's advocate) from the history of the last century. But, in the first place, not one of those cases which could be said in its circumstances to resemble this was considered as incorporated into the code of nations for acknowledged law, but was reprobated at the time as a flagrant breach. of that law; in the next place, they were all cited by the hon. and learned gent. himself, for the purpose of establishing, in point of fact, a principle which he (Mr. R.) was not at all interested or inclined to dispute; viz. that a formal declaration of war is not always necessary previous to the commencement of hostilities. This principle was extracted from Bynkershook, a writer upon the law of nations of undoubted authority, who, in the chapter upon this head, enumerates a variety of cases in which a formal declaration of war was not deemed necessary. But that writer does not lay it down as a principle, that in no case shall it be deemed necessary, On the contrary, Vattel, whose authority is relied upon by the hon. and learned gent. himself, does expressly state, that a declaration of war is necessary, and that, too, in a case which he should hereafter shew was analogous to the case now before the house. But, he was confident the hon. and learned gent. with all his research, could not produce, either from Bynkershook or any other writer upon whose authority he was prepared to pledge his own high character, a principle like this; viz. that during a negociation you may commence hostilities without a declaration of war; and yet that principle must be established, before you can be said satisfactorily to have justified the manner in which hostilities were in this instance commenced. There was an instance in our history which, in many respects, bore a striking resemblance to the case now under consideration; he meant the attack of the Dutch Smyrna fleet by Holmes, in the time of Charles II. But, as that was one and not the least of many measures of infamy, for which the cabal of that day deserved and obtained the execrations of posterity, he presumed no well-constituted govt. would justify itself upon such a precedent. There, too, after the hostile blow was struck, certain grievances were discovered as affording a pretext for413that aggression&#x2014;for pretences are never wanting where the stronger power seeks to oppress the weaker. Among other things was alleged a supposed indignity offered to the British flag by the Dutch fleet, through which a British yacht was sailing&#x2014;a ground of complaint, by the way, which the wisdom of modern times has taken effectual care shall never exist again&#x2014;how honourably to those who sacrificed this proud distinction, or how advantageously to the country he would not here stop to enquire. But, bad as that case was, it was in one respect not so bad as the case now before the house. No points in difference were at the time under discussion between the two countries, so that the Dutch were not deluded by a shew of negotiation when the attack was made. The recal of Temple, who they knew had too much honor to lend himself as an instrument of treachery to any government, and other circumstances, had warned them of a growing indisposition towards them in the British councils; so that so far from being taken by surprize, they were prepared to encounter an enemy, and the treachery of the attack was in a great degree, and indeed almost altogether defeated. We had, indeed, in this case, the advantage of success, if that success can be counted an advantage which is obtained at the expence of national honour.&#x2014;Before he quitted the subject of precedent, he could not help adverting to a paragraph in the declaration on the table, which he owned had not a little surprized him. It is stated that the arrival of the treasure ships is \"an event which has more than once in former times, become the epoch of the termination of discussions and of the commencement of hostility on the part of Spain.\" If because upon other occasions war has sometimes broken out soon after the arrival of the treasure ships from Spanish America, it be meant to be insinuated, that you have a right arbitrarily to intercept their treasure when it may suit your convenience pending a negotiation between the two courts, he denied the inference as utterly unfair and unjust. Indeed, the proposition was upon the most cursory view obviously untenable. If it were only intended to state, that, in point of fact, war had heretofore followed hard upon the arrival of the Spanish treasure, the remark was surely rather too uninteresting to deserve a place in so grave and solemn a state paper. But he had stated this act to be a414violation of the national faith implicitly, pledged. In support of this proposition, he contended it to be a general principle, that when a negotiation is opened between two states for any purpose, but above, all for the adjustment of differences, the negotiating parties are mutually pledged each to the other, to a forbearance from all hostilities until the discussions are finally closed. This principle he should, with the leave of the house, at present take for granted; being prepared hereafter to prove it by the highest and most indisputable authority to be found in the circle of the law of nations. That a negotiation was begun and continued until our minister quitted Madrid, the volume of documents on the table abundantly proved. In the midst of these discussions, which were calculated to lull them into a state of perfect security, whilst the relations of amity were supposed to be still subsisting, your ships received with hospitality in their ports, and the ships of Spain navigating the seas in the full persuasion of that security which nations not at war are intitled to enjoy, you take a treacherous advantage of their confidence, and commit that which is nothing short of an act of open war. You amuse them with a mockery of negotiation, for it is no other than a mockery, if whilst they are lead to indulge a hope, which to the last they reasonably may, that the discussions may ultimately terminate in the complete re-establishment of a good under-standing between the two countries, without any previous intimation to them you send out a hostile squadron for the purpose of attacking an armed force of Spain. The honest satyr in the fable would not endure a guest who had taught his breath to blow both hot and cold; but you commence hostile operations at the very moment when you pretend to be negotiating in the character of a friend; you abruptly cut the kno: which you affect a willingness to untie; you invite them to a parley and you fire upon them under a flag of truce. But here he was encountered by various positions in the Declaration which it might not be improper to notice. There probably would be no difference of opinion upon the effect of the treaty of St. Ildefonso abstractly considered. He could not, however, subscribe to the assertion, that Spain entered into it \"for the avowed purpose of endeavouring to subvert the government and destroy the national existence of G. Britain.\" During the last war indeed, it might be415said to have this country for its particular object, but in the contemplation of future wars, the intention must have been to secure to each other a pledge of mutual assistance against any power with whom either of the contracting parties might happen to be at war. But if you think fit to wave that right which the treaty gave you, unless disclaimed, you cannot afterwards in fairness insist upon it, having once elected the line of forbearance. It is stated, that \"the groundless imputations in the Spanish manifesto are built upon the foundation of this forbearance alone.\" He saw no contradiction in this; and here he could not help noticing the manner in which the noble lord (Castlereagh) had misrepresented this part of his hon. friend's (Mr. Grey's) argument. The noble lord had represented his hon. friend to be at variance with himself, because he who, on the one hand, so strenuously contended for the preservation of the neutrality of Spain, on the other hand violently pushed things to the last extremity, by insisting that the treaty should have been considered as a just cause of war. Nothing, however, was more unfounded. His hon. friend's argument amounted to this. The treaty of St. Ildefonso, if acted upon in any manner hostile to G. Britain, if you wish to be inter apices juris, strictly speaking, affords you a just ground of war, subject, however, always to the question of expediency. But you are not justified in suspending this right with an intention of insisting upon it at some future period, you. cannot keep it in petto producible at pleasure when it may suit your own convenience. How is the British envoy instructed to act? Not to make the manly and ingenuous communication in what light the treaty is viewed by his court, but in the cant of special pleading he is directed to protest against the convention. Now is this special pleading reserve, this \"pro-testing always\" and that too, upon the matter immediately in issue, fit to be introduced into a great political question where the point in issue between two independent nations is no less than that of peace or war? To a question put by M. Cevallos, whether a continuance of the pecuniary succours would be considered as a ground of war, he says \"he is authorized so to declare it, and that war would be the infallible consequence.\" This is categorical and definitive enough. In the very next paragraph, speaking of discussions416which took place at a subsequent period, he says, that until the stipulations of the convention between France and Spain are communicated to him, \"he could give no positive answer whether the pecuniary succours would be made a cause of war or hot.\" Now, what is Europe to think of the wisdom of your councils, when there is upon the face of your proceedings so much fluctuation, indecision, and uncertainty, when they see that you have not even the wit to state your own case with consistency? On the 18th of Feb. the British minister declares, that all further forbearance on the part of England must depend upon the cessation of all naval armaments and a prohibition of the sale of prizes in their ports. On the latter of these points a satisfactory answer was given, and as to the former, there was no appearance of naval preparations at that period whatsoever, and it was also very worthy of remark that there was long afterwards as little appearance of naval armaments, as would appear by referring to a dispatch from Mr. Frere to lord Harrowby, dated so long ago as the 5th of July. In the month of Aug. the British charg&#x00E9; d'affaires is stated to receive advice from admiral Cochrane, of reinforcements of soldiers and sailors arriving through Spain for the French fleets at Toulon and Ferrol. Possibly there might be some arrivals at Ferrol, but in the papers on the table there is no trace of any reinforcements reaching Toulon, nor indeed did it appear how they well could through Spain, so that Toulon, it should seem, was ^introduced merely as an elegant expletive. Again, it was stated in the declaration, thattowards the end of September,information was received in London from admiral Cochrane, of orders having been given by the court of Madrid for arming without loss of time in the ports of Ferrol, Carthagena, and Cadiz, and the packets as in time of war.In consequence of this intelligencethe British minister is directed to remonstrate and demand explanations. Now, the order of the admiralty under which the Spanish frigates were attacked, bore date Sept. the 18th, so that you issue a hostile order to your fleets at the very time when you direct your minister at Madrid to remonstrate and demand explanations. But, what was he directed to demand? \"Above all that their armaments should be placed on the same footing as before the commencement of hostilities,\" not the period of the con-417vention, or agreement or understanding, by whatever name it was to be called, as had been conceded to M. Cevallos by the British charg&#x00E9; d'affaires. Now, as this had been conceded, and the British court could not now disavow the acts of their own minister, it was much to be lamented that a condition disclaimed by their own minister should still be insisted upon in the declaration, as it afforded a ground to the court of Madrid to charge the British govt. with a breach of good faith. Again, he was directed distinctly to state the orders of his court to its commander to prevent Spanish ships of war from sailing to or from Petrol&#x2014;Not a word about the treasure ships&#x2014;Lord Harrowby's excuse to the Spanish ambassador seemed perfectly unsatisfactory. If intelligence could not have been conveyed by the court of Spain to the commanders of their treasure ships, the communication from our court would have been useless, and, if it could, the order would have been rendered nugatory. For this mode of reasoning applied with precisely the same force to the other Spanish ships of war of greater force; nor could any sound distinction be drawn between them and the treasure ships. Another ground of complaint alleged in the Declaration was, the removal of Spanish ships out of dock to make room for French men of war. Of this it would be sufficient to say, that the papers on the table furnished no proof of the fact. But it was stated that the govt. of Spain \"contemplated from the beginning of the war the necessity of making itself a party to it.\" The Declaration in the Spanish manifesto is, that from its relations with France it must have with difficulty refrained from taking part against injuries offered to its ally. Whilst they were stating the difficulties they had to struggle with in avoiding offensive operations against G. Britain, was it fair to interpret this into an admission on their part, that they were from the first unavoidably identified with France in the war against us? But \"the detention of the treasure ships formed no part of the motive of the previous hostile character manifested by the court of Spain.\" If any previous hostile disposition existed, that undoubtedly could not be influenced by an affair which took place afterwards. Then it was asserted, that the state of war must have arisen had the detention never taken place. But how did this appear? Other points in difference418might possibly have been adjusted, but a breach of faith, and an insult offered to the flag of a generous and high minded nation, do not so easily admit of atonement.&#x2014;The hon. and learned gent. said, he had dwelt the longer upon the Declaration, because that was the instrument which, ministers had offered to the world, and by that they must stand or fall as the justification of their conduct in involving their country in a war with Spain&#x2014;and how vague and unsatisfactory the apology was, he trusted he had sufficiently shewn. But he had undertaken to shew that the attack upon the Spanish frigates, pending a negotiation, was against the express letter and spirit of the law of nations. For this he should rest upon no less reverend an authority, than that of Grotius himself; who, though the first to reduce that valuable science to a system, sprung as it were at a bound to the very top of his art. He says, \"sic et qui colloquium aut postulat aut admittit tacit&#x00E9; pollicetur collocutoribus id innoxium fore.\" He then, as is his custom, adduces his instances, and in the very first says, \"per colloquii speciem jus gentium perfidy&#x00E9; violari.\" Here, then, it was expressly laid down, that during a negotiation you are pledged to do no act of violence to the party with whom you negotiate. Vattel, also, in the case of a contested right says, \"after an ineffectual endeavour to obtain justice by conciliatory measures a declaration of war ought to follow, and not pretended reprisals, which, in such a case, would only be real acts of hostility without a declaration of war, and would be contrary to public faith as well as to the mutual duties of nations.\"&#x2014;Now, if reprisals in such a case be pot admissible, still less can you resort to an act which has in its nature more of violence and outrage than are to be found in any case of reprisals whatsoever. But the character of this measure is not that of hostility, but merely an act of detention. He believed it was the first time that detention had been used to describe such an act since it was first imported into the English language. Here was a regular-action between two opposite squadrons of equal force, in point of numbers, in which 3 ships are taken, a fourth is blown up, and upwards of 300 lives are sacrificed! Yet in the Declaration, and in that house, it was resolutely maintained to be merely an act of detention. Lord Harrow by, indeed, with a manly candour honorable419to his character, described the affair in its true colours, speaking of it in his dis-dispatch to Mr. B. Frere as a hostile action in which one frigate was blown, up and 3 werecaptured.The noble lord in another part of the same dispatch also admitted, that it was foreseen by ministers that the expedition might possibly be hostile and provoke resistance. This furnished matter of grave charge against them for not sending out a larger force so as to preclude the possibility of resistance altogether. As it was, however unequal the conflict might be to any nation encountering us with equal numbers at sea, the Spanish commander, not merely from a sense of honour, but as he valued his own personal safety, was absolutely compelled to fight; for he must indisputably have been shot if he had submitted to such a force without resistance. But what would have been said, if, in the interval between the date of the admiralty order and the time of our minister's quitting Madrid, complete satisfaction had been obtained from the court of Spain? Restitution would have been made! As to restitution of the treasure that was lost, with an overflowing treasury and a bank full of specie (as it must be, for it pays none) perhaps there would not have been much difficulty in settling that account. As to the ships, those that were, taken might be restored, and for that which was lost, we would build them a better, and so that account also would be settled. But there was another account not quite so easy to adjust. Can the sea yield up its dead? How can you make restitution to the king of Spain for the loss of so many valuable subjects, or to the numerous families bereft of so many valuable relations by this rash act of violence and outrage? So much for restitution and detention&#x2014;a detention which is destruction, and a restitution, an offer of that which cannot be restored. But the outrage was not sufficient: after all, Spain was: to be wounded with that cruel and insulting assurance in the Declaration repeated in that house, that the conduct of G. Britain towards her was that of moderation and tenderness.&#x2014;As to the other view of the question, viz. the ground of policy, he could not help thinking that, the war might have been avoided, consistent with the honour and the best interests of the nation. If the friendly disposition of Spain towards this country wagged confirmation, that confir-420mation was abundantly afforded by those papers, for a knowledge of which, the house and the public were indebted to the exertions of his hon. friend (Mr. Grey) who moved for their production. (Here Mr. R. read the concluding part of the extract of a dispatch from Mr. Frere to Ld. Hawkesbury, dated 9th Oct. 1803, being No. 8. of the papers delivered to the house 2d Feb. beginning \"Your 1dp. may rest assured,\" &c.; and so on to the end of the extract, see p. 179.) Nor did it appear that this friendly disposition had ever been weakened. The pecuniary succours paid by them to France could not be considered as voluntary; they consented to pay them as the price of their neutrality. Still less could they fairly be urged against them by us as a just ground of war, who connived at the same payments made by the Hanse towns, and even by Portugal, our close ally. If we knew them to be oppressed by the domineering influence of France, the comity of nations, and even common humanity should have induced us to consider their embarrassing condition with an eye of indulgence, and should have dictated to us the obvious policy of forbearance and moderation. And if ever there were a period when more than at another, it was our duty and interest to conciliate the powers of Europe by a religious observance of good faith, and of the law of tuitions, this was unquestionably that period. For, able as we were, and he trusted ever should be, to defend ourselves alone, if we hoped to set any bounds to the gigantic and overgrown power of France, that could only be effected by the co-operation of the continental powers, which must arise from the conviction alone that our cause was just. And even if the justice of our cause were mote indisputable than he feared it could be made to appear, we had made an impression upon the nations of Europe highly unfavourable to our honour by the mode in which we had commenced; hostilities, shewing that we were actuated by a sordid thirst of lucre rather than a generous resentment of supposed wrongs.&#x2014;On every ground, therefore, both of the impolicy of the war and the injustice with which it was commenced, the amendment of his hon. friend had his cordial support.", "author_id": "/people/mr-jonathan-raine", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1805", "feb", "12"], "content": "expressed his determination, to vote for the address, and wished shortly to detail his reasons to the house. He could not discern those breaches of good421faith upon bur part with which the proceedings of this negotiation had been reproached. The relative situation of the two' governments required vigilance, discrimination, and jealousy on our part, and on the part of Spain candour and openness of communication; we discharged our duties, but Spain failed in hers. Charges had been made of long lapses on the part of our govt. during which nothing was done, nor any instructions sent to our minister at Madrid; but it appeared to him, that on the contrary, a regular system was laid down at first, which was followed up from beginning to end, notwithstanding the different hands into which it came, with as little variation as possible. With respect to the treaty between France and Spain, it was evidently pointed against England; it was evident that Spain by that treaty was placed, if not in an actual state of hostility with this country, in a state very near it, and that she could scarcely maintain a qualified neutrality. The refusal to communicate the provisions of that treaty to us rendered it evident that there was something hostile to this country; why should they refuse to make that communication, if they did not know that, from the conditions of that treaty, they must be immediately involved in war? Besides, the subsidy furnished was larger than the force to be supplied, and was evidently meant for the annoyance of this country. Our govt. acquiesced for a time: but it was expressly stated that such a system could not be allowed to be permanent. He did not blame the mode of terminating that discussion, as we certainly had a just ground for war, however some might say that the grounds had been altered. He could not, however, discover any abandonment of our positions, after the war with France, or any agreement that Spain should enjoy the neutrality which she proposed. There was only this, that when our minister confined himself to two specified conditions of neutrality on the 10th of February, Spain might say that every other point was given up, and in this view of the subject he wished that this sort of interpretation had been protested against on our part. He wished that when Mr. Frere found the sense in which his propositions were taken he did not immediately afterwards explain precisely in what sense he meant, them by which all future cavil would have been avoided. The learned gent, had quoted, several authorities, but422he wished to know where that learned gent. had discovered that the suspension or no usage of a right extinguished that right; he contended that the direct reverse, was the truth. The subsidy, as he before said, exceeded the contingent; the1 amount of the subsidy might be known by our ministers; but the secret articles of the treaty could not; these were carefully concealed, and for what purpose? was it possible that if it was merely to substitute a subsidy for a contingent, there was any occasion for all this mystery. It would have been an easy task to calculate the sums which ought to be paid for any ships, or regiments, in reals or dollars, but by this denial of communication, Spain confessed that she paid more than her contingent. France, indeed, had given Spain no option, and consulted her own convenience by having the money brought to Paris, where a loan was negotiated for the purpose. The armaments in the ports of Spain had been denied in that house, but were they denied by the Spanish minister? on the contrary, the armaments in Sept. though denied in that house, were not denied by the minister at Madrid, or the; Spanish minister here. They said they were not directed against this country; but we had aright to doubt and to require a different statement of the grounds of these armaments. If they were intended to transport troops from one province to another, why not inform us? Was there any doubt that armaments in Spanish ports might be converted in the hands of France into engines of hostility against this country, and particularly those at Ferrol, and if our minister had not remonstrated against them, would he not have grossly failed in his duty? The ships besides that were used were of a sort never used to transport troops, and in the provinces to which they were said to be destined, there was no convenience for landing troops. These naval preparations on the part of Spain were not deified by the Spanish ministers. But if these measures rendered measures of precaution necessary on our part, this country was not answerable for the consequences; and as to the objection, that a larger force ought to have been sent out, it should be remembered that the treasure was expected to come home in single ships, and that the force sent was amply sufficient to prevent all resistance from a single ship. If it were necessary to stop ships, it was right to use every necessary means to stop423them. It had been said that when lord Harrowby came into office, he thought of nothing but the treasure ships; but, if our enemy annoyed us by treasure, it was necessary we should deprive her of those means. Our whole conduct towards Spain had been dictated by fairness and moderation, and we had been gainers by not taking advantage of extreme rights. We were at war, not for any fault of ours, but of Spain. There had been, on her part, a continual denial and refusal of fair and candid explanation. He repeated, that the refusal on the part of Spain to communicate the conditions of the treaty to us, was evidence of its being inimical to this country, which was confirmed by the French general Bournonville refusing permission to communicate it. It were to be wished that a greater force had been employed, but it had been supposed that the Spanish treasure would have been sent in single ships. The question, however, was not altered by that consideration. If it was right to stop the ships, it was necessary to use the force by which they were to be stopped. He considered the detention of the treasure as the act of a wise statesman; that the writers upon the law of nations justified it; and that the refusal of Spain to give the satisfaction required was the cause of the war. By our conduct in not proceeding to those extremities which we should have been justified in recurring to, we had given the world a proof of our moderation. Upon the whole, lie was of opinion that nothing had been done by which the character of this country had been compromised.

He would maintain this opinion, although he was ready enough to believe, that the greater part of the country was fond of a war with Spain. The idea of being at war with a power vulgarly imagined to be possessed of immense treasures, was congenial enough to popular sentiment; but he trusted that that house would not allow itself to be hurried away by any such delusion, but examine with the strictest scrutiny the papers before them, ere they ventured to concur in the address proposed by the right hon. the424chancellor of the exchequer. He was not unwilling to allow that the treaty of St. Ildefonso might constitute a ground of war for G. Britain against Spain; yet such as it was, it was little more than a transcript of the ancient treaty call the Family Compact, which had subsisted between the different branches of the house of Bourbon silting on the French and Spanish thrones. The articles were of a similar tendency, and yet when this country went to war with France in 1778, this treaty was not considered a sufficient ground to induce hostilities with; Spain, nor to provoke us to take measures such as we lately had recourse to. It was decidedly his opinion, that in the relative situation of the two nations it was clearly the policy of G. Brit, to cultivate a good understanding with Spain, and lord Hawkesbury should certainly have employed some gent. of high birth and conciliatory manners for that purpose. When first the French demand for pecuniary succours was communicated to the British court no expression of their disapprobation followed, and in his mind it would have been much more expedient to allow Spain to pay this subsidy than to force her into a war. He denied the position of the right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer, who seemed to think that the deduction of one million from the three agreed on for the purpose of paying debts from France to Spain, was immaterial. That right hon. gent. had likewise not fairly estimated the equivalent which this sum bore to the contingent stipulated for. One million was at most not too much for the expences of 15 sail of the line, and the other million which was left for the equipment and support of 24,000 troops was not adequate to the purpose. G. Brit. could not maintain them for twice as much. How was this arrangement at that time viewed by England? Will any roan assert, that it was then the intention of govt. to do any thing more than protest? Govt. had principally argued the point on the instructions and dispatches that passed between our minister at Madrid and his court at home; and not as they ought to have done on the notes and letters that passed between Mr. Frere and the court of Spain. From the tenor of such of Mr. Frere's letters to M. Cevallos, as had been presented to the house, he conceived that that gent. had received his instructions from the right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer, rather than from the noble sec. of state.&#x2014;The hon. gent. here criticised several of Mr. Frere's425notes, both on account of the manner in which they were composed, and of the matter which they contained, particularly one of the 2d Jan. M. Cevallos might well require explanation, as it was written in the most barbarous French he had ever met with. In his note of the 18th Feb. Mr. Frere drops the subsidy, and confines himself to the two points of the armaments, and the sale of prizes in the Spanish ports. After M. Cevallos had twice demanded explanation on this point, its not being pressed is an absolute and unequivocal abandonment of it, and on the 22d of March, M. Cevallos states, that he considers the neutrality of Spain admitted. He was at a loss to conceive on what ground Mr. Frere had couched his note of 18th Feb. in such strong terms. He certainly acted in direct contradiction to his authority; for lord Hawkesbury, in his instructions of the 21st Jan. recommends him carefully to avoid bringing the negotiation to an abrupt termination. It was evidently the system of the then govt. of G. Brit, not to enter into a war with Spain, on account of her subsidy to France. Spain is said never to have given official communications with regard to that treaty; true, but the progress of it was well known, and had been stated in every stage of it by Spain. With respect to verbal communications; if we admit accounts of the conferences between the prince of peace and Mr. Frere, we must also admit accounts of those between our court and M. d'Anduaga. When the right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer asserted, that the dispatch of the 29th Sept. afforded full evidence of a determination to revive a subject that had so long lain dormant, it appeared to him to be merely an assertion of the difference between a weak and puerile administration, and that of the rt. hon. gent. Compare these dispatches with those of May, in which our govt. clearly abandoned the subsidy as a cause of war, provided no armaments provoked them to hostility. But, say they, armaments did take place. If they were directed against England, it would require no argument to prove the unqualified right of England to make them a ground of war. What reply, however, did the governor of Ferrol make to the representations that were addressed to him on this subject? That the armament is destined for a secret purpose, but that it needs not excite the jealousy of any European power, the ships being but hall manned. If426Spain were disposed to contravene her engagement with this country, French finesse would have suggested a happier mode of concealment. Accompanied as this answer was by the want of preparation in every other port of Spain, its truth could not be doubted. On M. d'Anduagua's being questioned by lord Harrow by, he professes utter ignorance of the subject, and two days after brings an officer belonging to one of the regiments composing the armament at Ferrol, with letters stating that the object of it was to quell the insurgents in Biscay. This, Mr. Frere, in a subsequent dispatch, confirmed, and expressed his conviction that such was the fact. Some of the minister's arguments operated in two contrary directions and destroyed each other. If the agreement to suspend hostilities were advantageous to France, she would not have instigated Spain to break it; if war with Spain were more advantageous to France, we shall be losers by precipitating ourselves into it. It was inexplicable how, on such instructions as were contained in lord Harrow by's dispatch of 29th Oct., Mr. B. Frere could judge himself warranted in making the communication of the treaty with France, and the reduction of all armaments in Spain an ultimatum. The hon. gent. severely reprobated a passage in one of Mr. Frere's notes to M. Cevallos, as being justly offensive to the court of Spain, and disgraceful to the court of G. Brit. It mentioned the influence of France on the Spanish councils, asserted the dependence of Spain on that power, and insinuated the consequent distrust of England. These circumstances were true, but this rendered it more improper to hint at them, and he was well assured that this conduct of the British charge d'affaires was strongly reprobated by the whole corps diplomatic of Europe. But this was nothing to a subsequent part of Mr. Frere's proceedings. He censured the letter of Mr. Frere of the 18th Feb. to the Spanish minister M. Cevallos. He considered it a disgrace to the person who wrote it, and such as never before had been, or ever again he hoped would be, sent by the minister of one great nation to that, of another. Having read it, he said he considered it was a wanton insult of the strong against the weak. Such conduct he knew met the reprobation of those who were best acquainted with the language of diplomacy in Europe. He wished the right hon.427the chancellor of the exchequer to consider how he would feel, if such language were held forth to him by the minister of a foreign power; No man was more proud than the right hon. gent. none had more right to be so, because none possessed in a more eminent degree those qualities which raised erne man above another, than that right lion. gent.; but he would venture to ask what would have been his feelings, if any minister had addressed him, as Mr. Frere had addressed the minister of Spain in the letter alluded to? He then proceeded to observe on the inconveniences we had brought upon ourselves by the principal measures we had taken or this occasion. Had we conciliated Spain, its neutrality might have continued, and with a favourable opportunity it might have risen into consequence in the states of Europe; it might have become a powerful, a proud, and independent state, and might have assisted us in humbling the pride of France, but now we had furnished France with, an excuse for overturning Spain with her armies, and, perhaps, destroyed the Spanish monarchy, besides, the consideration of what was due to our ancient ally, Portugal, which by this measure might also be over-run and destroyed, a thing now to be expected. He concluded by saying, that no part of our conduct with regard lo Spain redounded to our honour, on the contrary to our disgrace, such as was regarded by the most intelligent persons on the continent with utter reprobation, for which reasons he must protest against it, and vole for the amendment.", "author_id": "/people/mr-george-johnstone", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1805", "feb", "12"], "content": "could not refrain from expressing the greatest salivation at being able entirely to concur in opinion with the hon. gent. who had spoken second in order in the debate of this evening; he wished, however, to add one or two observations to those which that hon. gent. had made on the statements of the learned gent. who had preceded him, and who commenced the discussion of this night. He should avoid adverting to the speech of the hon. gent who had just sat down, not out of the slightest disrespect to that gent. but because to all his arguments, complete answers would be found in the statement made yesterday evening by his right hon. friend near him, and he was, very unwilling to certain the house long, anxious as they necessarily must be, to hear the opinions of so many great and distinguished characters among them, who had not been428afforded an opportunity of expressing their sentiments on this momentous subject. With regard to the analogy which the learned gentleman (Mr. Raine) asserted to exist between diplomatic proceedings and the occurrences of special pleading, and with regard to the construction which he had attempted to put on the different passages that he had quoted from various writers on the law of nations, he would not enter into any dispute with the learned gent. conscious as he felt of his own in competency to the task; otherwise he would not hesitate to acknowledge that the passages so quoted conveyed to his mind a very different meaning, and led to very opposite reasonings. The learned gent. although he allowed that the unexplained treaty of St. Hdefonso afforded a complete justification of war with Spain, yet seemed to wish that something more decisive had appeared in the conduct of the British; govt. to Spain, on the breaking out of the war with France; and that, instead of the forbearance and moderation which had distinguished the conduct of our court to that of Spain, and by which we had vainly hoped to secure the neutrality of that power, we had directed a message to the Spanish govt. requiring a categorical answer, containing a complete explanation how far Spain conceived herself to be bound by the treaty of St. Ildefonso, In this wish he must totally dissent from the learned gent. What would have been the result of such a proceding? What answer should we have received from that court? And what impression could have been made by a demand, calculated to irritate and provoke those whom the learned gent. admitted (and in this point he perfectly agreed with him), it was our true policy to soothe and conciliate. Should we have attained our object? Should we have received a decisive negative or affirmative? The probability is not. The government of Spain would have replied \"we have no desire to act up to the conditions of the treaty, we rather wish to avoid doing so, and we ask for time to enable us to concert the best measures for eluding them.\" Then, had his maj's ministers received such an answer, would the learned gent. have been prepared to advise them to deny the Spanish application for a prolongation of the demand? He rather thought not. He rather thought the learned gent. would have seen nothing in such an answer, but a request from a weak429and oppressed govt., which it would have been the highest cruelty to refuse. The result, would thus have been similar to what it had been in the procedings adopted by the British cabinet, with the inconvenience superadded of having causelessly agitated a question, which motives of humanity and prudence imperiously demanded should be suffered to lie dormant. He confessed that he was one who had waited with excessive anxiety for the production of the documents from which alone it was possible to form an accurate judgment of the conduct pursued by the two administrations who shared in the discussions which had taken place with Spain. He felt inexpressible satisfaction in stating, that through the whole course of them, he found the same uniform tone of lenity and forbearance towards Spain. He traced it though all the dispatches from his noble friend Lord Hawkesbury. He traced it in the instructions which proceeded from the late noble secretary of state. He traced it in those emphatic words to our minister at Madrid to \"make one more effort if possible to preserve a state of peace with Spain.\" Deeply sensible as he was of the truth of the facts which he had stated, be humbly presumed to implore the house to pause before they gave their votes for the amendment offered to them. He could not say what were the real motives of the hon. gent. who had proposed it. He had no doubt that they were pure, but be loudly called on the house not to agree to a motion replete in its consequences with injury to G. Britain, to a motion which, if it were adopted, would lower this country in the estimation of all Europe, would lower the spirit of the inhabitants of this country, would unbrace the nerves of every British soldier and sailor now engaged in the protection of Old England, and induce them to believe, that instead of fighting for their country, they are contending in the defence of the most lawless and dishonourable outrage.", "author_id": "/people/mr-henry-addington", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1805", "feb", "12"], "content": "said, that it was his intention last night to have noticed, in a few sentences, what had fallen from his hon. and learned friend (sir John Nicholl). Had be done so, at that period of the night, and exhausted as he and the house in general were, he should have confined himself merely to two or three points which had been touched on by his learned friend. Having, however, this night witnessed430the cofident tone in which an hon. gent. who sat beside him (Mr. Bankes) had addressed the house, in a speech almost every word of which was built on bold and glaring misconception; when he heard it stated that govt. had acted throughout with humanity and moderation, yet with vigilance, alacrity, and firmness, and, therefore, that gentlemen were not to satisfy themselves of the truth of such allegations, lest they should damp the public spirit, he felt himself called on to enter more at large into the subject, and in the first place to inquire if this was really the situation of that house, that if Ministers chose to plunge into a war on unjustifiable grounds, they were not entitled to inquire into the causes of it, lest in so doing they should damp the spirit of the country! He would never sit tamely in that house and bear it asserted, that we should not disapprove the proceedings of an administration, lest such disapprobation should humiliate the country in the eyes of Europe, and unnerve the arms of our brave countrymen who were engaged in espousing our quarrel. He would tell the right hon. gent. (H. Addington) that the avowal of error, instead of being humiliating, was highly honourable, and that little dependence could be placed on the valour of men who fought blindly, without having entered into the merits of the dispute, and to whom the contest for right or for wrong was equally desirable. He owned he felt the greatest indignation when he heard such doctrine introduced into that house, and he could not refrain from openly avowing that indignation. He would not be deterred from expressing his undisguised sentiments-on this subject, by being told that a Spanish war was popular in this country. He had no doubt that it was popular. He had no doubt that an enemy, rich in pillage, and weak in power, was a popular enemy; but surely, these were not facts to be stated in that house, as arguments to convince them that they ought to connive at fraud and outrage, and abstain from censuring the perpetrators, because their measures were popular. If this was really so, he should wish to be informed for what reason they sat there, and what was the meaning of the bundles of papers in the hands of the members, and lying on the table of the house? The discussions by which this war had been preceded, were said by those who dis-431approved of the way in which he thought, to hive been marked by uncommon forbearance, and at the same time, by vigour and energy. There was, however, within the last century, but one war in which this country was engaged in which the integrity of G. Brit, had been questioned, and that was a war against Spain. From this very reason ought we to have been particularly cautious of commencing hostilities against her, unless on the clearest and most undeniable grounds, lest our motives should be questioned. Spain was at the time to which he alluded a more powerful nation than she was at present, and the more were we called on to guard against our integrity being suspected. When a country, like Spain, rich in pillage and weak in power, was seen about to engage in war with a powerful state, it was natural to feel suspicious that her riches and weakness might have contributed to involve her in that situation: and if so, was it not for the honour of the country that the causes of the present contest should be investigated, and our integrity established? When the last treaty of peace was concluded, he had unequivocally stated as an objection to the recognition of it, the subsistence of the defensive treaties between France, Holland, and Spain, and had submitted how far, while such treaties existed, we could, in case of a new war with France, regard those other two powers as in a state of neutrality. Ministers then made light of that objection, but they themselves started it in the beginning of the present discussion.&#x2014;The hon. and learned gent. then went through different points which had formed the subjects of discussion in the course of the correspondence, and contended that on none of them had our govt. put things in so clear and regular a state, as to make them the legitimate subjects of war. By the wavering policy of the late administration, or by their weakness and imbecility or by what other name the present ministers chose to term it, the country had unquestionably been placed in a disagreeable situation, But had the present Ministers extricated themselves or the country out of it, or had they not rather added to the ambiguities and doubts which formerly existed, others of a more extraordinary and more fatal kind? The hon. and learned gent. then made some observations with regard to the dispatches which passed between. Mr. Frere and his May's432Ministers, the object of which he could not see, unless it was for the purpose of at once entering into acts of open hostility. He could not help observing a phrase which had been inserted in the declaration: it was agreed, that war was to be declared, in case a French army entered Spain. The word \"army\" was struck out of the declaration, and \"troops\" inserted, for the purpose, he supposed, of ministers having some shadow of pretence for the conduct they had been guilty of.&#x2014;He then alluded to Mr. Frere's want of instructions, which he said, were, in fact, nothing, until the very period of seizing on the Spanish frigates. One of the demands made by our ambassador to the court of Spain was, that English ships of war in Spanish ports should be treated in the same manner as French ships of war. This, he said, was agreed to; and, though he did not wish to stand on words, yet, when he saw a demand made and agreed to, he thought it should be binding. It was stated, that, in a preceding war, ships had been taken before the formal declaration; he acknowledged that to be a fact; but it did by no means determine the question, as that very circumstance alluded to, had since been condemned by every man of common understanding. He was sorry to hear so many instances recounted of hostilities being commenced before the declaration of war, as he was perfectly well convinced in himself, that in almost every one, the proceeding was blame able. The hon. and learned gent. then took a review of the law of nations, on declaring war, and quoted several passages from Grotius and other writers. He said, it had been urged, that ministers were justified in going to war on account, of the breach of the condition on the part of Spain. As to that point, he thought the breach must be perfectly clear, which was not, even by the ministers, said to be so in this case; they only said the condition appeared to be broken; but suppose it had actually been the fact, suppose the condition had been broken, every circumstance should have been strictly examined before any steps were taken, or at least, any other than those which were absolutely necessary. He said, the greatest possible argument that could be offered against the war with Spain was, that France would derive the greatest possible advantage from it; she would have under her command, not only the navy and army, but half the revenue of Spain,, all of which433would contribute to make her still more formidable than she was at present. The armament at Ferrol, of which we complained, consisted of three ships; the order for fitting them out was received on the 7th, and on the 15th they were countermanded. This was the great and alarming measure, which was to excite so much fear for our safety, and called for immediate reparation and redress. There were, indeed, other armaments that might have proved a just subject of com plaint, and justified strong measures on the part of the British govt. He meant the armaments at Carthagena and Cadiz, and yet there was not a word of alarm respecting these two ports. No orders were dispatched to prevent the armaments from sailing out of the ports of Cadiz and Carthagena. To Cadiz, indeed, 2 frigates were sent to make prizes of vessels that might wish to go into it; but not a word was said of any armament coming out; and, as to Carthagena, no measure whatever was deemed necessary. It was curious to see, out of three cases, two of them thus entirely omitted, and all the fear and Apprehension confined to one. If Spain had a naval war in contemplation, was it probable that she should be totally unprovided with the means of carrying it on? that she should have no timber at Cadiz, until the very last moment? yet such appears to have been her real situation in that particular. So far from having her arsenals filled with naval stores to an extent which the consumption of war might require, she had no timber at Cadiz, but such as was barely sufficient for immediate purposes totally unconnected with the warfare. She had no contracts for naval stores, no provision was made that could indicate an hostile intention. Even Mr. Frere himself had borne testimony to these pacific appearances on the part of Spain, as in one of his dispatches he stated, that from all the information he had received from the coast, it did not appear that there were any armaments going forward. He admitted, at the same time, that another dispatch shortly after announced preparations in the port of Ferrol. He would ask, how were these discordant reports to be reconconciled? The pacific disposition of Spain, if left to herself, was universally acknowledged, and her hostile conduct imputed entirely to the domineering influence of France. But, was it possible that the overbearing influence of France should be so unsteady in its operation, as not to be able434to exist ten days together without interruption? It was strange, if warlike preparations were making at any time under the influence of France, always so uniform and steady in her enmity to England, that they should proceed only by starts, and be liable to such interruptions. The al-ledged destination of those ships at Ferrol has also been adduced as a proof of insincerity on the part of the Spanish govt.; and the answer of the Spanish commander, stating that they were destined to convey troops to quell the insurgents in Biscay, has been argued upon as pregnant with internal evidence of falsehood, and totally inconsistent with truth. The subsequent march of the troops for that purpose, by land, was relied upon, as a proof of the fallaciousness of that explanation; but he did not think it deserved so much weight as was attached to it. Although troops were afterwards sent to Biscay, by land, it did not follow but that it might have been thought advisable to have sent troops also by sea, and it was very possible that it might have been in the contemplation of the Spanish govt. originally to send those very troops by sea, which they afterwards marched by land into Biscay. He did not profess an accurate knowledge of the coast of Spain in that quarter disturbed by insurrection; but he could conceive it very possible that it might have been deemed advisable to attack the insurgents at the same time by land and sea; and although there might not be a very deep and commodious harbour on that part of the coast, yet troops might have been very well landed by boats from the shipping at a convenient distance. As a farther proof of the innocent intention of the armament in Ferrol, admiral Cochrane asserted, that the three ships composing it were only half manned. This is at once evidence of the fair intention of the Spanish govt. and of the weakness of the fears which the armament excited. That three ships, half manned, should be a force competent to produce such serious apprehension as would not allow his maj.'s ministers 24 hours time for deliberation, he could not conceive. If they were fitted out for an hostile purpose, and if they did threaten mischief, where was our vigorous and efficient administration of whom we had heard so much? Were they so limited in their means, that they could not afford to send out three ships to prevent any urgent danger to be feared from these three half-manned Spanish vessels? Admitting,435however, every possible appearance of hostility to attach to the armament at Ferrol, still it was possible that the object was innocent, and might possibly receive a full and: satisfactory explanation; but, under these circumstances, what course did ministers pursue? They adopted a course that precluded the possibility of all explanation. They sent out orders to the West Indies to Capture Spanish vessels; orders that could not be recalled in time, even in case of a subsequent satisfactory explanation, and were consequently so far final and decisive. In fact, no demand of explanation was made of M. d'Anduaga until the orders were sent off, and explanation must have come too late to prevent their being carried into execution. Leaving the question of explanation, however, aside, he Contended that the Measures adopted by our govt. Ought to have been commensurate with the danger, if any such really existed, and ought not to have exceeded the necessity of the case. Consequently, the act of hostility to which we had recourse, having gone far beyond that necessity, was utterly indefensible. But then we are told that French soldiers and sailors were marched across the Spanish territory to mail the French vessels at Ferr'ol, and that this was an unquestionable breach of neutrality, if put as an abstract, general case. But what were the particular circumstances under which it occurred in the present instance? The Spanish minister declared in his letter, that gen. Bournonville had obtained leave to march 1600 men across the Spanish territory. And Mr. Frere had written to lord Hawkesbury, communicating the circumstance, without receiving in answer any instructions to consider it as an act of hostility. In that light, however, it was afterwards thought fit to view it, for the measures adopted by our govt. in consequence, could be considered as nothing else than acts of hostility. It is idle to call our conduct a system of precaution; it was actual hostility, and is entitled to no other name, Mr. Frere's departure from Madrid was in the same spirit. He was not justified in coming away when he did, as his own dispatch admitted, that the Spanish minister had expressed his hope to be able to shew that the object of the armament was perfectly innocent in relation to this country, and the sincerity of this declaration was the less to be suspected, as Mr. B. Frere had expressed, in one of his letters, his belief that the armament was destined against the Biscayans.436With these reasons against an Hostile construction upon the proceeding, and to induce a favourable interpretation, Mr. Frere had no right to take a strong ground, and say to Spain, you shall not move even a single ship out of one of your own ports, even to chastise your rebellious subjects, as if it were impossible that such could be the real object. His own dispatch evidently implied a possibility that an innocent cause might be made out; and if so, he had no right to take a definite and decided step, in opposition to any such possible case. But what followed? Lord Harrow by, in his conversation with M, d'Anduaga, declared that the capture of the Spanish treasure was only a measure of precaution. Was it then right, he would ask, that we should proceed in every part of the world, taking Spanish treasure, although it appeared that the armament was innocent? An expectation, it is said, was entertained that the treasure would Come home from America in single ships, and this had been relied upon as an answer to the objection to the force of the squadron that engaged the Spanish frigates off Cape St. Mary, but the reverse he would venture to state was the fact. Several months prior to that event, information was received, that the Spanish treasure ships would sail in company. An accurate list, containing their names, &c.; was published, from whence it appeared, that 5 were to sail together from Lima; and yet, with the advantage of all this knowledge, a squadron of only four frigates was employed to intercept them. So much for the expectation, that the treasure would be brought home in single ships. Let no man suppose that this disparity of force upon the present occasion was a matter of little importance. The honour of the flag is dear to every maritime nation, and, perhaps, there is nothing so likely to involve two countries in hostilities as any insult offered to it. The hon. and learned gent. condemned the conduct of the administration in the most pointed manner, and availed himself of every Opportunity that the papers afforded him to censure their proceedings. When we called upon the nations of Europe to support whatever of civilization there was remaining in Europe, it was necessary that we should endeavour to keep our own conscience free from any acts that could weaken our appeal. We should not seek to relax the ties by which men were hitherto bound to the principles437of rectitude. We should not seek for precedents of wrong, nor make cases to justify our own violations. In common matters he would not go against the sense of the house, but in cases like this, it was for the house to consider, whether it would become it to decide without hearing all the arguments that could be offered; for himself, nothing should deter him from saying what his duty and his judgement dictated on an occasion which so deeply involved the honour and character of the country.", "author_id": "/people/mr-french-laurence", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

He began by observing, that it was the less necessary for him to occupy much of their attention, since the arguments urged by his hon. friend who moved the amendment remained completely unanswered; and the hon. and learned gent, who had just sat down had not at all succeeded in overthrowing the doctrine laid down in the speech of his hon. and learned friend near him (Dr. Laurence); a speech not only replete with good sense, but what was not less valuable, with the most enlightened and liberal maxims of policy. But what still further superseded the necessity of his going into any length of discussion was, that the hon. and learned gent, had not, in the course of his reasoning, attempted to uphold the distinction betwixt a suspension of hostilities and a system of neutrality, by which we were to be placed in a more favourable situation, and enabled to take whatever advantage we thought proper, whenever a convenient opportunity offered itself. He confessed that the language he had heard on this subject from the right hon. gent. who opened the discussion, and other gent. on the same side, struck him with astonishment. It was neither more nor less than the language of gross fraud. When he heard the right of putting an end to neutrality asserted, just at that period when we could take the greatest advantage of the state with which the neutrality previously existed, he could not help considering it as altogether monstrous. He was happy to find that the hon. and learned gent, had not attempted to support such a doctrine as this, that we should be justified in entering into an implied agreement with another power, by which that power conceived itself safe from attack, merely with the purpose of renewing hostilities, at the moment when they were least expected. He was glad to find, at the same time, that the learned gent. was not disposed to deny the existence of that agreement which some other gent, seemed so anxious either to deny altogether, or to misrepresent its nature and449extent. He hoped the house would hear no more of the idea of appearing to acquiesce in an arrangement, and afterwards disclaiming its existence, when some sinister or criminal purpose was to be promoted. He had read in an ancient tragedy of one of the characters expressing a wish to Jupiter, that, for the purpose of preventing the effects of deceit, man had been provided with two voices, the one for the utterance of truth, and the other for the utterance of falshood. It had not, indeed, pleased the governor of the world to form such an arrangement, but if there was not an actual difference of voice, there was an eternal difference of language, and if there was any dictionary for this language it would be important to have it understood, that 'to pass over' was not 'to acquiesce in;' that to wave the exercise of a right was merely to wait for the convenient moment to employ it with greater effect. If he had understood the hon. and learned gent. he confined his grounds of the war chiefly to two circumstances. The first of these he had styled the remote cause, and the armaments in the Spanish ports he had described as the proximate cause of the renewal of hostilities. With respect to the remote cause of the war, he had no difficulty in saying, that if the treaty of Ildefonso was an offensive treaty, and he had also as little hesitation in adding, that he did consider it in that light, its existence was unquestionably a clear ground of war against Spain. The hon. and learned gent. had stated, that this treaty was still more hostile to this country than the Family Compact, as the succours stipulated were to be given without any right to ask for explanation, as to the grounds of the war in which they might happen to be employed. He was not quite sure that in the Family Compact there was an absolute clause to this effect, but certainly this peremptory power of demanding the succours had always been urged as one of the most powerful arguments against that treaty. However this might be, it was not very material to the present argument. But, though he coincided entirely with the hon. and learned gent. as to the right of this country to compel Spain to renounce the treaty1 of Ildefonso, or to declare hostilities against her, he took up his grand objection to the conduct of ministers, in not coming to an immediate explanation on the subject as soon as ever hostilities were renewed between this country and France.450Admitting our right to declare war, it became a question of policy whether some arrangement could not be formed by which the good understanding betwixt the two countries might be preserved. Such an arrangement, he confessed, appeared to him consistent with a liberal policy, and ministers appeared to have entertained a similar opinion. When war with France became inevitable, it was easy enough to foresee that Spain must, from her engagement with France, soon he brought into a disagreeable dilemma, and what he complained of was, that no steps were taken by ministers to make provision for the consequences. In the first letter of lord Hawkesbury, he found our minister at Madrid ordered to make the strictest inquiries respecting the views of the court of Spain, and afterwards it did not appear that he ever came to any explanation on the subject. An hon. member on the same bench (Mr. Bankes) had, in his speech, attempted to point out what were the relative duties of the two countries in rather a novel style. He had stated, that frankness, openness, and candour were required of Spain; that vigilance, circumspection, and jealousy were the duty of this country. He confessed he had ever conceived that frankness was a quality which could only be mutual. If we wished others to be frank, we must first be frank ourselves. If we expected full and candid explanation, it was first incumbent on us to exhibit, in our own conduct, proofs of openness and integrity. These observations were founded, not in the laws of nations, or the customs of England, but in the constitution of things, and the laws of our being. Till he had perused the papers on the table, he had not conceived it possible that any lines but two could have been pursued. The first was a determination for instant war. If, on the contrary, a different course was to be attempted, that no time would be lost while the disposition of the Spaniards remained amicable, to conclude any arrangement by which their neutrality might be preserved. What, then, was it that ministers had done to accomplish this most important object? In the month of June, lord Hawkesbury had given our minister at Madrid no powers to form any arrangement; and five months elapsed during which nothing was done, and that when ministers could not be ignorant that French intrigue would be sufficiently active in instigating Spain to act up to the terms of the subsidiary treaty. During all this451period there is no communication made, no explanation authorized, no intelligence given to the Spanish court of the objects, views and dispositions of our court. What was here to be concluded, but that ministers believed that Spanish neutrality was intimately connected with the dictates of policy, but had left the whole matter wholly to chance, which every man of common sense saw to be full of difficulty and embarrassment? Not only do five months elapse without any remonstrance or explanation, but this silence is observed at a time when the hope of successful negotiation was by far the most natural. Spain did not attempt to conceal her real situation. She disclosed the demands which France was making, and if we were unable to yield her assistance, she had at least a right to look for our advice for the establishment of her future relations with this country. But what rendered the conduct of ministers the more inexcusable was, that though they knew as far back as the 12th of Sept. and were again assured on the 24th of the same month, that a subsidiary treaty was actually negotiating, they did not make even one effort to prevent such an arrangement from taking place. Under all these circumstances, Spain was now attempted to be calumniated for commuting the treaty, by which a contingent was to be given for a subsidiary agreement. Much stress was also laid on calculations that the amount of the subsidy was greater than the amount which by the treaty of Ildefonso they had agreed to furnish to France. This, however was nothing to the purpose. It was very material, so far as respected France and Spain, though not this country and Spain. The question was, had or had not Spain reason to suppose that the commutation as the contingent for a sum of money would be more agreeable to this country? and had she not acted on the idea that the change would be desirable. Spain took the method of relieving herself from her embarrassments which appeared the most unexceptionable; and if ministers here who were apprised of the step she was about to take, disapproved of it, why did they not remonstrate on the subject? But it was clear, from the language of lord Hawkesbury, that he did not consider the commutation as in, the least objectionable. In one of his dispatches he instructs Mr. Frere, that if on inquiry he finds that the court of Spain had determined on giving the contingent, immediately to demand his pass-452ports and quit Madrid; but that if he should find a proposition for a commutation treaty, he should take no steps on the occasion, but report to his court. Was not this a decisive proof in what light ministers viewed the commutation treaty? But now Spain was traduced for subsidising France. The hon. and learned gent, had allowed, that ever, since the family compact there was always a slender prospect of the continuance of peace with Spain, while hostilities existed betwixt this country and France. He had even mentioned that the administration of 1778 had been censured for not foreseeing and providing against such an, event. He thanked God that sooner or later the sentiments of opposition had full justice done them, and he was happy that the opposition of 1805 had left future oppositions an example by which to form an estimate on this subject. He certainly thought that the administration of 1778 was very short-sighted not to provide against the probability of a rupture with Spain. But how much more short-sighted and culpable were ministers now, when the great difference in the state of Spain was considered? Formerly the control experienced was the control of the govt. of France over the govt. of Spain, but was not a control arising from the wishes of the people or the apprehension of a French army taking Madrid. Now, it was the apprehention of being overrun by the French troops, that rendered every act of the Spanish court absolutely dependent. Formerly, there might have been a presumption of a hostile mind. Now, there was not the least room for such a suspicion. It was ridiculous to think of Spain wishing now to share in the conquests of France, or the glories of her chief. The events which had lately happened in Europe, must, he hoped, have cured the inferior states of this triad ambition. But as ministers must have foreseen the probability of a rupture, as they were apprised of the arrangement of Spain to ward off this calamity by a subsidy to France, the question arose out of the extent of this pecuniary sacrifice. Now, it was saying nothing, to say that its amount was larger than the amount of the contingent, because Spain being forcea to have recourse to this expedient, could not prevent this result from taking place. It was well known that the person commuting a contingent for a sum of money, was, to a453certain degree, at the mercy of him by whom the commutation is to be received. This was precisely the situation of Spain, but Spain could not in justice he blamed for a circumstance necessarily arising out of her dependant situation.&#x2014;The hon. gent. after again expressing his indignation at the idea of keeping back grounds of offence, went on to comment on the agreement of the 28th of Jan. and confirmed by another letter of the 18th of Feb. by which the payment of the subsidy to France was acquiesced in as a temporary expedient. It was true that Mr. Frere thought proper to deny that there was any agreement, and though it is positively referred to in M. Cevallo's letters, he says his only reason for not protesting against its existence was, that no part of his conversation countenanced the idea. But, surely, this was a curious reason, that Mr. Frere, because he found M. Cevallos labouring under an error, would take no trouble in correcting the mistake. M. Cevallos continues to believe in the existence of the agreement. M. d'Anduaga expressly mentions its existence to lord Hawkesbury, and his lordship never drops a hint of there being no such arrangement. Was it fair, he asked, betwixt man that such an agreement should have been understood to be in existence for a number of months, that the Spanish court should have uniformly acted on it, and that when it suited our Ministers it should be denied? M. Cevallos, in his letters, asserts the existence of the agreement, and explains the two conditions on which it is to continue in force. As to the sale of prizes in the Spanish ports, there were no difference of opinion. The order respecting arnaments was also acceded to, though certainly M. Cevallos contends, and not without great reason, that the armaments should refer to such as were meant to succour France, or to act hostilely against this country.&#x2014;Here the hon. member argued on the state of the enemy's preparation, which never could have excited serious apprehensions. The armaments at Ferrol were quite inconsiderable. They never exceeded three sail of the line, only half manned. They were sufficiently fitted to convey troops to Biscay, and however absurd it might be represented, even Mr. Frere himself, who was not the most disposed to put a favourable construction on the views of the court of Spain, allowed that454this was their destination. The orders for sailing from the outer to the inner harbour, were given on the 7th of Sept. and on the l6th they were again ordered to be laid up in ordinary. Here, then, only 9 days elapsed before every source of apprehension from these preparations was removed. No man could seriously believe that Spain had hostile intentions. If any thing had been wanting to convince us of her pacific intentions, her conduct on this occasion ought to have removed all ground of suspicion. He condemned ministers most warmly for issuing those orders which had produced such unpleasant and unfortunate consequences; which had plunged in war two countries having no cause of hostility to each other, without inquiry into the information which admiral Cochrane had transmitted from Ferrol. He meant no reflection on the character of that gallant officer, but he had transmitted erroneous information, both as to Carthagena and Cadiz, in none of which ports were there the least symptoms of preparation. The pacific views of Spain were, indeed, manifest to all Europe, and it was the height of absurdity to talk of her armaments. It had been said by the hon. and learned gent. that the armament at Ferrol was at least mysterious, and remained so. On the contrary, there appeared every reason to believe, that Spain considered that armament no violation of the existing agreement; and indeed its being so speedily countermanded most clearly evinced that it could never have been undertaken on any system of hostility to this country. With respect to that armament, however, lord Harrowby, in his second letter, admits that it might not only be capable of satisfactory explanation, but might even be such as this country would approve its continuance. Much had been said about the refusal to communicate the treaty of subsidy, but, in fact, from what appeared in the papers, no formal official demand of its communication had been made till Oct. just before Mr. Frere's departure from Madrd. Nor was this, in all probability, an accidental omission; for the circumstance had frequently been the subject of conversation, particularly on an interview with the prince of peace, when the latter referred Mr. Frere to the Secretary of state for Foreign affairs, M. Cevallos; and though Mr. Frere had resolved to demand a conference, in order to state the question to455the secretary, it seemed that no such conference ever took place. Nor was it perhaps a matter of blame that the official demand of this communication was deferred, because ministers might have seen that, there was no immediate occasion for it. The certainly had it in contemplation, on the recal of Mr. Frere, to send a person every way qualified for the station, Mr. Wellesley, to negociate on the whole state of our relations with Spain; and if that recal was proper, for the sake of avoiding prejudices that might Lave been hurtful to the success of any negotiation in the hands of Mr. Frere, after the difference with the prince of peace, it surely would have been proper also to have recalled his brother, whose connection was calculated to keep alive those very prejudices which the recal of the former was intended to prevent. The demand of the treaty, however, was at last made officially just before Mr. Frere left Madrid, and at a time when it must have been manifest that war was resolved on; although indeed there was nothing in lord Harrowby's instructions that authorized Mr. Frere to leave Madrid, if in the first instance the claims he had been directed to insist on were not granted in all their extent. Besides, though not formally communicated, it was pretty evident that ministers were acquainted with the terms of the treaty, and perhaps too from confidential communications by the Spanish govt. Yet even the refusal of the communication of the treaty could not be considered a justification of the war, so far as the capture of the frigates was concerned, because that refusal was subsequent to the order which produced the capture. It was said, however, that at the period when that order was given, we would have been justified in going to war, and of course were justified in every measure that was short of war. In what light then was the capture of the frigates to be viewed? Was it of war or precaution? If, it was as a precaution, it was to be remembered that there was a most important distinction between detention of property in our hands and an attack on the royal flag of another nation: In the One case property might be restored, but in the other an apology, perhaps of a humiliating kind, might be necessary to v give satisfaction, not to mention the lamentable and unnecessary sacrifice of human lives. The measure, however, seemed to have been considered rather456as an act of war than of precaution. What dreadful consequences then must follow, it on the alleged violation of a constructive agreement, loosely worded, actual war were to be commenced? If it was a measure of war, to what purpose instruct Mr. Frere to negociate on the footing of tranquillity, still existing? To what purpose labour lo prolong peace, when war was actually begun? It was like saying when a man had already been hanged, let him still have a fair trial to see whether there was reason to hang him or not. Indeed, there was something in this transaction that equalled in bad faith any of the most perfidious acts of the worst of governments in any age. What instance, unreprobated and uncondemned by history, could be found to justify it? Suppose that discussions existed between any govt; that a public minister was directed to negotiate for the removal of any obstacles that might disturb the existing tranquility: suppose that with much address he had prevailed upon the pride of the other govt. lo submit to concessions, that he had brought them to a temper of conciliation; a post arrives from his court, and those with whom he had negotiated, then imagining that they were to reap the fruit of their concessions, when, instead of the confirmation of peace, it is announced that acts of open hostility had been committed while negotiations were going on upon the footing of actual tranquillity. What must be the feelings of such a govt.? What would be thought of any public minister who could lend himself to such a scene of fraud and duplicity? Is it possible that any person in the rank of a gentleman could descend to play so unworthy a part? Yet, what was the fact here? Had not the Spanish frigates been captured, and was not Mr. Frere instructed to negotiate as on the footing of uninterrupted peace, and to bring matters to an arrangement, altogether keeping out of the view hostilities committed? He had no doubt, therefore, that Mr. Frere must have been imposed upon when employed to carry on a negotiation, concealing from Spain so important a fact as the capture of their frigates by an act of open hostility. What could have been the avail of any arrangement concluded while, that fact was unknown? Must it not have broken up what had been done? Was it not, therefore, in itself nugatory, and to the Spaniards most insulting, to negotiate with them, conceal-457ing so important a circumstance? Were similar treatment to be experienced by this country from an ambassador negotiating in such a situation, it would be doubtful whether the ambassador, to use a phrase of Mr. Frere's, would escape with impunity, from the more liberal spirit of the mob. Was there any good precedent for such a proceeding, and if there was any but those accursed precedents already alluded to, let it be pointed out? If it was a measure of war then that the Spanish frigates were captured, it was in pursuance of a system of policy altogether irreconcileable to good faith. If it was a precaution, it was not a measure that partook of the nature of precaution, because measures of precaution were directed only against particular dangers, but the danger from the Spanish treasures or Spanish power, were dangers not existing at particular moments merely; but dangers of that sort that were to be removed not by precaution, but by war It appeared, too, as if ministers had felt some remorse for what they had done; for they gave orders not to attack merchant ships carrying treasure or stores, though if it was necessary for our self preservation to prevent stores and treasure reaching Spain in king's ships, it was equally necessary to prevent their being conveyed in merchant's ships. What was called indulgence, therefore, was only a modification of what was felt to be unjust, in order to mitigate its odium. With respect to the necessity of declaration of war, though wars had been commenced without declaration; yet, the best authorities stated it to be most eligible to declare war first; and there was an instance at the commencement of that glorious war which began in 1702, that the govt. then, by a public proclamation in the gazette, ordered all ships seized and detained previous to the declaration of war, to be released, as was stated in the proclamation, \"in pursuance of the law of nations.\"&#x2014;There was only one more observation he had to make, and it was on the menace or caution to the opposition, not to damp the courage and zeal of the public, by censuring the conduct of govt. or arraigning the justice of our cause! But if those on his side of the house were not convinced (and it was not in a man's own power to be convinced) of the wisdom of administration, or of the justice of the war, what was he to do? Were they to speak and vote against their opinion, to be silent, or to leave the house? Had not his majesty by submitting the papers to their458consideration, called for their fair unbiased opinion; and such an opinion they were bound to give. The reputation of parliament was of the first importance to the public interest, and that reputation could only be maintained while parliament continued the faithful council of the king and the upright guardian of the state. What could tend more to damp the national spirit, and to make them question the resolves of parliament, than a supposition that they did not speak or vole as they really thought, but were influenced by patriotic fears of making unfavourable impressions on the public mind? As, however, both in public and private life sincerity was the source of confidence, and in order to convince men of one's sincerity it was necessary to be sincere, he conceived it his first duty to declare his real sentiments, and to lay before his majesty his real opinions. Thinking the administration culpable in the conduct of the negotiation, and in the war with Spain, he saw no reason why be should not by his speech and by his vote express those sentiments; he should therefore give his most hearty assent to the amendment.", "author_id": "/people/mr-charles-fox-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

During the long negotiation which had preceded our rupture with Spain, much must have passed of which the house were yet ignorant. In the official correspondence that had been laid before them, there were numerous chasma which he wished to see supplied, and it was for this purpose that he had prepared the motions which he had prepared the motions which he now held in his hand. When our govt. received the first information of the pecuniary succours afforded by Spain to France, it must have been productive of minute instructions to our ambassador at Madrid, and of considerable discussions with the Spanish govt. His first motion,150therefore, was, for \"copies or extracts of all letters from his maj.'s minister at the court of Madrid, relating to the demands made for succours by France to Spain in July 1803, with the instructions sent to the said minister thereupon, and an account of all the discussions which took place on that subject with the Spanish govt.\" To Mr. Frere's note of the 9th Sept. 1803, addressed to the Spanish minister, and complaining of the passage of 1500 Trench artillery-men through Spain, no answer appeared; in all probability, some answer must have been received; indeed, lord Hawkesbury, in a subsequent letter, adverts to this subject in such a manner, as to prove that no answer had been received, he should therefore move for \"a copy or extract of any answer given by the court of Madrid to Mr. Frere's. note of the 9th Sept. 1803, respecting the passage of a body of artillery-men and marines through Spain to reinforce the French fleet at Ferrol; and also, an account of all explanations which may have taken place with the Spanish govt. and of all assurances received from the same, respecting the passage of French troops or seamen in general, since the commencement of the war with France.\" There now appeared a vacuum in the correspondence of upwards of 3 months. It was impossible but that, during this long period, a great deal of interesting and important correspondence must have passed between our court and that of Spain, more especially with regard to the pecuniary succours afforded to France by the govt. of Madrid, he should, therefore, move for \"copies or extracts of all letters from Mr. Frere to our court, between the 12th Sept. and the 27th Dec. 1803, relative to the money paid by the Spanish govt. for the use of France, together with copies or extracts of the instructions sent to the said minister I thereupon.\" In lord Hawkesbury's letter of the 21st Jan. 1804, reference was again I made to the pecuniary succours which France had received from Spain. On this subject he thought we ought to receive the; most ample and satisfactory explanation. He would, therefore, move, for \"copies or extracts of all correspondence explanatory of the pecuniary succours from Spain to France, alluded to in lord Hawkesbury's f letter to Mr. Frere, dated Jan. 21, 1801.\" In the course of the correspondence between our ambassador and M. Cevallos, allusions were frequently made to a con-151vention between England and Spain. Of every thing relative to this convention, it one did exist, we ought to be most fully and minutely informed; his next motion, therefore, should be for \"a copy of any convention, contract, or agreement, which may have been entered into between G. Brit, and Spain, respecting the neutrality to be observed by the latter power during the present war with France.\" Another long interval now appeared in the correspondence. From the 21st Jan. 1804, to the 22d May, 1804, not a single letter or a. single instruction from our govt. to Mr. Frere was to be found. To fill up this hiatus, he would move for \"copies or extracts of all correspondence that had passed between Mr. Frere and lord Hawkesbury from the 21st Jan. 1804, to the 22d May, 1804.\" At this latter period the new administration came into office. Lord Harrowby succeeded Lord Hawkesbury, but of tins noble lord's letters to Mr. Frere we had but 3 given to us, one on the 22d May, another on the 29th Sept. and the last on the 21st Oct. 1804. It cannot have escaped the observation of the house, that in some of Mr. B. Frere's latter notes to M. Cevallos, his demands for passports are more urgent, and the expression of his determination not to remain in Madrid, unless he obtains a satisfactory answer to his requisitions more strong than what his authority in the letters from our govt. laid before the house seems completely to warrant. There must still remain a portion of the correspondence of which the house were not in possession, and to endeavour to procure this, he would move for \"copies or extracts of all instructions to Mr. B. Frere, subsequent to the 22d May.\" It was highly probable, as the Spanish minister at our court and our govt. must have had frequent discussions on the important negotiations that were going on at Madrid, that some notes expressive of the sentiments of each party must have passed between them; he should therefore move for \"copies or extracts of all official notes or letters that may have passed between the Spanish minister at our court relative to the points in dispute.\" By some accident, as he imagined, the letter of Adm. Cochrane, on which lord Harrowby's dispatch to Mr. Frere, dated the 29th Sept. 1804, sind giving an account of the armaments, or supposed armaments, at the Spanish ports was founded, had been omitted in the papers laid before the house. Tim was a152material letter, and it was likewise very material to ascertain the period at which it was received. For these reasons, he should move for \"a copy of the letter of Adm. Cochrane, containing the information referred to in lord Harrowby's dispatch of the 29th of September, 1804, respecting the naval preparations in Ferrol.\" In Admiral Cochrane's letter of the 11th Sep. 1804, he describes the formidable state of the Spanish naval force in the port of Ferrol, and in his letter of 21st of Oct. which is the next in the papers laid before the house, he says,\" The Spanish ships, here are in the same state as when I wrote last.\" Now, the fact was, that between those periods of the 11th Sep. and 21st of Oct. those ships had gone back to the arsenal Some necessary, letters therefore, of Adm. Cochrane's, had been omitted; and he should move for \"copies or extracts of all letters that may have been received from. Adm. Cochrane, giving an account of the state and force of the Spanish ships in the harbours of Ferrol and Corunna, between Sep. 11, and'Oct. 21, 1804.\" In Adm. Cochrane's letter he speaks of the preparations in Cadiz and Carthagena. It would be highly desirable to obtain the original authority from which he derived his information, he would therefore move for \"an account of all intelligence sent by his maj.'s consuls at Cadiz and Carthargena, and by any officers of his maj.'snavy, respecting any naval preparations there, and of the state of the arsenals.\" The hon. gent, concluded by observing, that still to add other links to the chain of information which he wished the house to possess, he should move further for \"copies of all accounts transmitted by Sir E. Pellew, describing the state of the French and Spanish ships in Ferrol and Corunna. Copies or extracts of all letters from Sir T. Duckworth, respecting the conduct observed by the Spanish governor at Cuba, relative to the sale of British prizes since the commencement of the war with France; and accounts of all supplies of stores and provisions furnished by Spain to the squadrons under the command of Sir E.

Agreeably to the precedents already referred to, the house would perceive that it was usual to move that evidence should be heard at the bar upon such an accusation; but to that part of the course of proceeding the noble lord did not think it at all necessary to adhere upon the present occasion, because the report on the table contained a very full account of all the evidence which related to the conduct of the sheriffs; that account was taken in short hand by a person sworn to report it with fidelity, the several witnesses were interrogated by the members of the committee, who were also on their oaths, and they underwent an ample cross-examination by counsel of the highest ability employed by the accused. The circumstances of the case were therefore already before the house, and there was no necessity for the further examination of any evidence on the subject. An objection, indeed, offered against the further production of evidence, from this consideration, that witnesses not being examined on oath at the bar of the house as161they were before the committee, might be induced to prevaricate. On the score of precedent it did not appear to him to follow that a motion for the further hearing of evidence should be made; for in one of the precedents that had been read to the house, the reason alleged to shew the propriety of such a motion was, that the party accused had no counsel present at the committee to cross-examine the witnesses upon whose testimony the accusation was grounded. This consideration could not be urged in the instance then before the house, nor did he conceive any ground upon which such a motion as he alluded to could be fairly sustained. The full investigation of every thing connected with the charge against, and the defence for the accused, which had taken place before the committee, of which he had the honour to be chairman, seemed to him entirely to preclude the necessity of any fresh examination of evidence. The case of a court martial, the minutes of the evidence taken before which formed the ground for the sentence, to be subsequently ratified by higher authority, he thought analogous to that of an election committee. To the committee it did not belong to pronounce any sentence, or to inflict any punishment. They had only to inquire into the subject referred to them, and to report their opinion thereon. Such was the course pursued by the committee whose report was under the consideration of the house, and that inquiry was so minute that he really could not think any farther inquiry by the examination of evidence necessary.

Will respect to the bill itself, he was rather obliged to his noble friend for bringing it under consideration. In considering the bill, the peculiar and extraordinary circumstances that preceded it, and which, to a certain extent still continued to operate, should be fairly considered. He was aware that, to a certain extent, endeavours had been made to counteract the operations of the bill; and these views would be rather forwarded, than otherwise, by the holding forth the idea that the measure was not likely to be persisted in. He differed widely from his noble friend in his opinion of the measure, as he knew that it was not only an efficient, but, he believed, it was likely to prove a very beneficial measure; at the same time he admitted, that the numbers at first expected were not raised under the bill. &#x2014;But when all the circumstances under which it was to be carried into activity, were kept in view, this was less a matter of surprise, as time was necessary to give it a fair chance of success. He had thought the army of reserve act a good measure for giving a large and speedy augmentation to the regular army. But it was not denied, that the army of reserve act was accompanied by many inconveniencies, which it was very desirable to remove. It had been particularly the means of introducing high and unprecedented bounties. Government perceived the necessity of destroying this evil if it could possibly be effected, and the expedient which they had fallen on to accomplish this object was the very bill which the noble lord proposed to repeal. The numbers which had enlisted from the army of reserve into the regulars was a conclusive proof of the general principle on484which the bill was founded. But the bill held out, not only encouragements connected with theArmy of Reserve Act, but others peculiar to itself. It was founded on the aid of local influence and strong public zeal, and he was confident that, if both these were properly applied they could not fail of producing the most important effects. If these were at any time, or in any district, totally dormant, the penalties which the bill inflicted, where the quota was not furnished, would furnish powerful means of recruiting for general service. The manner in which the bill was drawn offered strong inducement for the exercise of patriotism, and when properly understood, he had no doubt of its answering every object for which it was originally framed. If the bill were now repealed, the consequence must be that recourse must be again had to those high bounties to which the army of reserve had given rise, and to that system of balloting which it was allowed on all hands should be abolished as equally impolitic and oppressive. He was sorry that the merits of the bill were so much confounded with the character and merits of the administration. The noble lord who opened the business had described the measure as. a decisive evidence of the inefficiency of that administration which had held out such mighty promises to the country. He had, at the same time, argued, that such an administration as that now presiding over the national councils, was not such as the people required, or the state of the empire demanded. It was painful to him to dwell on a subject so personal, but he felt it to be due to himself and his colleagues in office to state, that if all the circumstances attending their acceptance of office were developed, much of the obloquy heaped on them would be spared. They had obeyed the call of their sovereign, from a sense of duty; they had not sought office from an inordinate thirst for power; they had not been hostile to that extended administration which the noble lord had declared to be, what the country expected; but they could not, consistently with their public feelings, refuse their services at a moment when they were called for by the sovereign at a difficult and trying crisis. The noble lord might lament the absence of an extended administration, but he had no right to arraign his maj.'s ministers for the arrangement, such as is now existed. But returning to the immediate question485before the house, he conjured their lordships hot to listen to a proposition for repealing the bill, at the time that it was beginning to produce the effects to be expected from it. Noble lords when they talked of the state of our military force, did-not seem to be aware how much had been added to it in the course of the last year. This number was no less than 28,000, of which number there were no less than 18,000 for unlimited service. When noble lords objected to the small numbers raised by this bill, they ought to bear in mind, that at this moment there were nearly 800,000 men in arms. It was not, therefore, at all a matter of surprize that men were raised with difficulty, and he was sure that the amount of the men raised last year was no sort of proof of want of activity on the part of the executive government. An impulse had been given to the recruiting service which, if suffered to go on, would, no doubt, be productive of the best effects. To repeal the bill would be to interfere with this impulse, and under this conviction he felt it his duty to resist the noble lord's motion.", "author_id": "/people/mr-john-pratt-3", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},
{"date": ["1805", "feb", "15"], "content": "rose. He began by assuring their lordships, that he never since his first entrance into parliament rose with more real satisfaction to give his support to any motion, than that which had this night been made by his noble friend for the repeal of this act. He felt himself particularly easy in saying this, because he was certain it must be in the recollection of every noble lord who was present, when he delivered his sentiments on this bill in its passage through the house in the course Of the last session, that the arguments he had used against the bill then, had since been, every one of them, found to be verified. No bill had ever been introduced into either house of parliament with a more pompous and magnificent display of the benefits to be derived from it, and the energies it was to put in force. It was brought forward on the spur of what was said to be a most important occasion, when the country was allowed to be in the most immediate and imminent danger of an invasion, and, indeed, so much so, that a month, a day, or even an hour was not to be lost in adopting measures for the most speedy and effectual means of increasing the army of the country, and that part of it in particular, which is called the dispose able force. At that moment, his lordship said, he and other noble friends of his, with whom he acted, saw on the first fair and mature consideration of its provisions, that so far from answering the important purposes for492which it was intended, it would have the direct contrary effect, and would be infinitely more injurious to the military service of the country than those measures which were proposed for that end by his maj.'s then ministers, whom it was a principal and primary means of driving from their official situations. Seeing it clearly in that light, his ldp. said he felt it to be his duty to his country, as a lord of parliament, to give it his most decided opposition, and that too in even stage; and, he appealed to their ldps. to say, whether the reasons he had then adduced against it, but which he would not now trespass on their ldps. time by repeating, had not been since proved to be but too true? He remembered though, that one objection, which he had very pointedly urged against it was, that it went to overturn the system of the army of reserve, which had, to a certain degree, been successful, and which, therefore, their ldps. should not agree to risk losing the benefit of, unless by some mea-sure that gave at least a prospect of proving effectual, which he then insisted this bill did not. He was therefore the more surprised, when he heard what had fallen from the noble earl who spoke last, in support of this bill, which altogether over? threw the army of reserve, and all the other military measures, which had been the greatest favourites of that administration, of which the noble earl formed a part. The bill, however, had soon been found to verify all that had been said of it, and to have entirely failed in effecting an increase of the army. In the course of the first two months, without using any particular curiosity on the subject, there was not, he believed, one of their ldps. who did not know its unfortunate fate, at least in the county in which he resided; and no one person in the whole kingdom had an opportunity of knowing it more pointedly and forcibly than the right hon. gent, who was the father of it, from the astonishing deficit which took place in the very district over which he presided. He had hitherto, however, confined himself to the objection? he had to it, as a bill intended to increase the military force of the country, by raising men for its service, There were, however, much stronger arguments urged against it, and the principal of these was, that, under the pretence of raising men, it went rather to the purpose of raising money upon the country. This had been strenuously denied to be the case by493those who supported it; but it had actually turned out to be the fact, and now formed one of the strongest arguments that could be used in favour of the motion made by his noble friend neat him for its repeal. As a bill for raising men, no one could deny that it had totally failed of its purpose; and if it was a bill for raising money, nothing could be more clear, than that it was deserving the highest reprehension, for it was infinitely partial and unequal, and fell, with an unexampled degree of weight and severity on the landed proprietors of the country. He insisted that another noble friend near him (lord King) was perfectly right in styling it a measure of taxation, which fell not upon property equally and generally, but on the ratio of population; and the instances which that noble lord had produced, ill support and illustration of his arguments, were conclusive and unanswerable.&#x2014;His ldp. then adverted to the very defective and unjust mode resorted to by the bill of recruiting for the army in the several parishes, through the medium, and by means of parish officers. Those regular officers who were appointed to that service by the army, were generally gent, who well understood that particular duty, and, by attention and experience, were enabled to form a pretty good judgment&#x2014;which was a good man, and such as might be trusted, and which was likely to prove shy and take the first opportunity to desert, He was also personally interested in taking particular care in these respects; but the parish officer was very differently situated, and might be liable, through partiality or prejudice, to return those who were likely to desert, and thus the parishes would become doubly burdened. The noble earl who spoke second, had acknowledged that the bill had not been so successful as could be wished, and yet contended that it ought to be persisted in, because, though it had been in force nearly twelve months, it was now only just beginning to operate. As yet he had heard no arguments which could, in the smallest degree, tend to convince him that the bill ought to be persisted in. Perhaps, said his ldp. before we rise, we may hear from some noble lords, who saw this measure in a different light last year, why they have changed those opinions which they then maintained so strenuously. He confessed he could not help being curious to hear what would be their arguments in favour of the continuance of a measure494which at once overthrew all those which they had so industriously endeavoured to promote. He wished to see how the new coalition on the other side, would conform themselves on the present occasion. He had, he said, made use of that expression, which had been so often used and misused of late years, in consequence of the noble earl who spoke last having applied the word coalition to him and his noble friends who acted with him. He insisted, that any man might have differed in opinion with one or more on the first and most important of political questions, and yet might afterwards perfectly and cordially, and with the utmost degree of consistency, coincide and act with them on a question, or questions, in which they all formed the same unanimous and decided opinion, as on any point of dispute, which might arise in a subsequent period of time. It was absurd to suppose that men thus circumstanced as he had described, should, because they bad acted on contrary opinions for any length of time, never agree or net together when they might think exactly alike. Every parliamentary character was bound in questions of a public nature, to act and co-operate with those who, in his mind, were most forward in support of the interests of his country, and he should ever think himself justified in acting on that principle; but when he should be found to abandon measures which he had once supported, and to join with those who differed from him on those very measures, then he should be contented to be charged with inconsistency, and to be said to have formed a coalition, or any other term which might be chosen to designate a real dereliction of principle&#x2014;His ldp. hoped the house would pardon him for having so far indulged in this digression from the subject immediately before their ldps, to which he again reverted, and said, that he was, from every argument he had heard that night, more firmly fixed in his opinion, that the motion made by his noble friend ought to pass, and the act to which it alluded be immediately repealed. One argument urged against it was, if you repeal, this measure, you will re-enact theArmy of Reserve Act, the ballot, and all those measures which have been formerly considered as detrimental to the public service. Allowing that to be the case, he would still support the motion of his noble friend; but it was not to be supposed, he495Said, that the matter was to rest there. Other measures would be brought forward, without doubt, and his noble friend had delayed, for a considerable time, to give notice of his present motion, or to take any steps whatever in the business, from a confidence he had in his own mind, that, as the bill was found to be so totally inefficient as that it had not answered one single purpose for which it was enacted, but had altogether failed, that therefore his maj's. ministers would be eager to seize the earliest opportunity of bringing forward either a bill to repeal it, or a bill to alter and amend it, in such a manner that the military defence of the country might receive every immediate support and improvement that time and circumstances would allow. Seeing that no such measures had been brought forward, nor intimation whatever given of an intention so to do, his noble friend felt it to be his duty to act as he had done, and he thought him entitled to the warmest thanks of the house and of the country. He knew, however, that his noble friend was willing, and he heartily concurred with him in the sentiment, to let his maj's. ministers off on as easy terms as they please. If they will promise to bring forward any measure to explain and amend the bill, or in any way to alter it so that it may become efficacious and serviceable to the country, they would be satisfied; but bethought the argument in favour of its being persisted in, because it was now only beginning to operate, was futile in the extreme, and be should, therefore, if no other more forcible one should be offered, be anxious for its being-dropped, as it could not be denied that it was a measure attended with a grievous expence, and with the most oppressive consequences to many parts of the country. He should, therefore, after thanking their ldps. for their obliging attention, conclude, by giving his vote for the motion made by his noble friend.", "author_id": "/people/mr-george-spencer-2", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},
{"date": ["1805", "feb", "15"], "content": "expressed his satisfaction that the noble viscount had addressed their ldps. before him. In many of the sentiments which had been delivered by the noble viscount, he was happy to express his concurrence, as they corresponded perfectly with his own. Whatever he should say in that house, he wished to be considered as coming from a peer of parliament, for in no other respect would lie enter that house. He was extremely anxious to hear what the noble viscount had to say on this bill, a bill which had been so unequivocally condemned by many noble lords who had acted with him, and from one of whom (the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster) he had heard a most eloquent speech in exposure of it. Indeed, all the late govt. were unanimous in exposing it. He heartily coincided with the noble viscount in the encomiums he had pronounced upon that patriotic spirit which produced the volunteer force. He was himself a volunteer officer, and he would admit that a very great force had been raised. There was an obvious inconsistency in the administration; a great500part of the present had charged the last with being imbecile and incapable of carrying on the govt. Well, the govt. was changed, and what did their successors do? Why, as the consummation of all their mighty promises, they produced the present bill, which hid answered no one of the objects which it proposed to effect. With respect to the volunteer system, he was a friend to it, if it were managed as it might and should be. But, in order to derive the full advantages which that system was capable of, it must undergo much alteration. The first charge by which an impression was made against the late administration, was, that they had neglected the volunteer system. A great volunteer colonel, the present chancellor of the exchequer, had undertaken to remedy it, but his R. H. could not find that it had been much improved under his superintending care. The volunteer force, compared with what it had been, was absolutely gone by; and if the attention of govt. were not immediately directed to it, it would shortly disappear. It was, therefore, the more requisite to attend to the military part of our defence; the regular army. In order to do this properly, it would be necessary to divide it into its several integral parts, such as militia, cavalry, British and foreign, and infantry of the like descriptions. He thought he could prove to their ldps. satisfaction, that the army, thus constituted and divided, was, in all its parts, very greatly and alarmingly deficient in the numbers at which it was stated. He then adverted to the artillery, which he contended, was also defective; but not to so great a degree as the other branches of our regular army. His R. H. stated from the estimates, that the Cavalry ought to amount to 26,196 men; but, he said, they were deficient considerably upwards of 8000.; that the infantry were 865 less than during the last year, though there had not been a single shot tired in anger between them and any of the enemies of this country, from the 1st Jan. 1804 to the 1st Jan. 1805; that the deaths in the infantry since August were upwards of 2000, and the recruits only so much above that number, as to make the increase no more than 110; so that the total deficit in the infantry was not less than 86,363 men; a number which would constitute an immense army. What, he asked, could ministers say to this, and what must the country think of so alarming a deficiency, at the very mo-501ment when those ministers have brought us into a new war? A war which they, had commenced by disgracing the annals of our naval glory, and making the first efforts of our fleet \"to consist of an act of piracy. They talked of a disposable force when they were conscious they bad no such thing; though they were engaged with an enemy, who possessed immense forces, and resources, from the mouth of the Elbe to Malta. If this were true, which he insisted it was, how, he asked, would it be possible, that, with such a deficiency, ministers would dare to send a single man out of the country? If they contented themselves with barely resting on their arms, without being able to attack the enemy, he contended it must prove the inevitable ruin of the country; and, as he looked on this bill to be the principal cause of this glaring and dangerous deficiency, he would certainly vote for its immediate repeal.", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-hanover", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},
{"date": ["1805", "feb", "15"], "content": "said, he should abstain from entering at large, or into any detail, in the observations which he meant to submit to their lordships. He had in no degree changed his sentiments since last year; he was still of the same opinion as then. He knew of but three modes of attaining a military force; 1st, by the exercise of absolute compulsion or conscription, for enforcing personal service; 2nd, by the ballot allowing a substitution for personal service; 3d, by ordinary recruiting. The first mode was unconstitutional and inconsistent with the habits, the manners, and the feelings of a free people, and therefore could not be attempted in this country. The second had been resorted to with considerable effect in theArmy of Reserve Act. This was no doubt a measure of rigour, but not of idle or tyrannical rigour, for it left the party affected by the ballot, at liberty to provide a substitute by a pecuniary sacrifice. When this measure had produced all that could be expected from it, an act for suspending it in its progress passed the house, when the change took place in the administration. Another bill was then brought in for raising men and money, but on a more equitable principle. By the provisions of theArmy of Reserve Act, if the individual would not serve personally, the tax fell upon him, and it was impossible to argue against the penalty, unless a compulsory power was resorted, to, to procure personal service. The present502measure was intended to obtain the men by the personal influence of the principal inhabitants, and if that influence should fail, the penalty was, and ought to fall, not on the individual, but on the persons having that influence, He knew of no measure more likely to succeed than this. His noble friend had said, that if ineffectual to its military purpose, it was objectionable on the score of its pecuniary operation. But he was one of those who thought the penalties should not be remitted under the existing circumstances, unless some other mode should be pointed out more likely to produce the men. His lordship said, after much professional experience, and after reflection on the various modes of recruiting the army, he thought that the present plan deserved a longer trial than that which had marked its origin and progress. If, however, after that fair trial which he now so earnestly solicited, it should still appear inefficient, no man would be unwise enough to persist in its continuance. As to noble lords affirming that it was a tax on the country, and that instead of men, it raised money, he could not deny but that every bill of this kind operated in some degree as a tax, although originally never intended to do so. If, as in some instances, money was paid as a legal equivalent for men, in places where' men were not easily obtained, it was, by this forced distinction called a sort of money bill, raising money by a mode which the legislature never meant, because it was well known that in this particular instance men were far more acceptable to govt. than money, as the very design of the bill was for the raising of men, and not for money. Those who attempted to poison the minds of the people by calling it a money bill, and thus to produce an odium against it throughout the country, certainly acted very unfairly, because by this false construction they endeavoured to obstruct the efforts of govt. in the public service. But he never heard of any measure, particularly that for the recruiting of the army, which could not be objected to. Every plan which had been proposed, for that purpose had been distinguished by its advocates and opponents; and he knew of no system which had ever been adopted that reconciled all difference of opinion. If some parishes or districts chose to compromise for men by the payment of money, that was no fault of those who introduced the bill, because it was503necessary that govt. should be supported, either in men or money; and if the latter instead of the former, then such contributions were applicable to the services of the state, by being expended for the raising of men. If the plan were bad, as some noble lords maintained, but which he denied, even then it was expedient to adopt it, till we found some better system to act upon. He therefore hoped t hat their lordships would agree with him in opinion that it ought to be continued at least till it had had a fair trial.&#x2014;The noble lord then, in allusion to some extraneous remarks on the part of noble peer, who had wandered out of his way to revive jealousies and suspicions, and to inflame party differences and temporary animosities, challenged the noble peer to produce one instance in which he could prove that either he or his colleagues in office had altered their principles. He denied any dereliction of principle whatever. There were some changes of an extraordinary nature indeed. Some of those with whom he and his colleagues had formerly the satisfaction and happiness of acting, had abandoned their principles, at least they had united with men who had uniformly avowed principles of a different nature from those that had been entertained and acted upon by them. He thought that the noble earl should have been more careful in the style which he had adopted. It was a dangerous expedient to censure others, and to sacrifice principle, for an ill-timed spleen or caprice. The noble lord said, that he had also always maintained, that the late administration was weak and inefficient, and he had no hesitation in still maintaining the same declaration. He had discharged his duty by the part which he had acted; and he was fully persuaded, that his illustrious friend, the present Chancellor of the Exchequer, had also acted upon the best and most honourable principles. These observations, he said, were extorted from him by the improper charges against himself, against his right honourable friend, and against those with whom he had the honour of co-operating for the good of the country. No men were free from faults. He and his colleagues in office had, at this time, been unfairly dealt with; they had been wantonly attacked and bitterly aspersed by those who were under the influence of wrong or mistaken motives. As there was not any argument urged against the present act which might not have been504with equal propriety advanced against any-other measure for the military defence of the country; and, as there had not been sufficient experience of the extent of the operation of the bill to authorise him conscientiously to say that it had not had the effect intended by the framers of that bill, he felt it a duty incumbent on him to support the law as it now stood, and vote against the motion of the noble lord who had opened the debate.", "author_id": "/people/mr-henry-phipps", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},
{"date": ["1805", "feb", "15"], "content": "observed, that the contradictory language and conduct of a noble viscount (Sidmouth) and his noble friend who had just sat down, had already been most perspicuously pointed out by a noble friend of his in the course of the debate, if that were material to shew the inconsistent grounds upon which those noble lords thought proper to resist the motion before the house. But for himself, he declined to dwell upon such inconsistencies. He never was fond to argue public measures upon references to the character or motives of any individuals who might oppose or second such measures. With respect to the motives of his noble friend (Mulgrave), he had no doubt that he was satisfied of the rectitude of the motives which actuated his conduct, and so no doubt was the noble viscount (Sidmouth) also, although the ground he stated for the vote he announced his intention of giving upon this question was rather singular, and one of which he never could persuade himself to approve. He could not say with the noble viscount, that although he, always disapproved of the bill, he should still agree to let it go on, and for what purpose? Why, that if ft failed of its military object, the penalties should be enforced, which penalties, notwithstanding, the noble viscount professed to dislike. There was another reason also which the noble viscount mentioned to justify his resistance to the motion, which struck his mind to be still more singular than the former; namely, that although he considered the bill originally inefficient, and still retained the same opinion, yet that as parliament had acceded to it, it would not be respectful to parliament to repeal it so soon after its enactment, without affording it a farther trial. Now, instead of its being very respectful to parliament, to continue such a measure, so unproductive in men, and so unjust, if productive, in money, he should feel it to be quite the contrary, and a glaring mark of indifference to public security at this dan-505gerous crisis, to decline putting an end at once to that mischievous tampering with our military system, of which the bill under consideration formed a part. When this bill was originally introduced, it met the strongest opposition from some noble lords, who recommended a different plan, which, upon comparison, they contended to be infinitely superior. But what had become of that opinion now? How came those noble lords to shut their mouths? Why not come forward and submit their plan at present? Did the change of situation produce a change of sentiment among those noble lords? Certainly, if they thought a few months ago that the plan they supported was likely to be more productive of men than the measure to which the motion before the house referred, nothing had since occurred that could fairly account for their departure from that opinion. Their experience should rather serve to strengthen the preference they before appeared to give to their own plan. For although the bill to which they on the present occasion professed to feel so much indulgence, had had 8 months to operate, the important consequences that its authors and advocates promised, it was still confessedly unproductive. This confession the house had heard from the highest authority, and the fact to which that confession referred, the house must recollect to have been foretold by him, and several of the friends of the noble viscount, at the time the bill was proposed. They said that it would not be productive, and its advocates asserted the contrary, and very confidently too; but yet they came forward this evening with a statement that gave a direct negative to these confident assertions. They admitted that the project which was to produce several battalions, as a nursery for the regular army, had in point of fact afforded comparatively nothing; and yet when the repeal of such an act was proposed, the noble viscount said, \"no, retain it.\" This surely was rather strange. He did not, however, mean to charge the noble viscount with a desertion of principle. He hoped the noble viscount acted upon principle, as he trusted it would not be denied that be himself did in calling for the repeal of a bill, the original passing of which he had used his utmost endeavours to prevent, upon grounds that now turned out to be completely justified. Upon the same grounds he would, on the present506occasion, press upon the good sense of the house the justice and necessity of relieving the country from this burdensome, troublesome, and odious measure. \"But no,\" said the noble viscount, \"the bill has not a fair experiment until the penalties are enforced;\" and yet, added the noble viscount, I do much disapprove of such penalties. In what a dilemma, then, did the noble viscount place himself. According to his opinion, the penalties ought not to be enforced. This opinion then held out an encouragement or premium to such parishes as should not raise their quotas, and of course tended to prevent the execution of the bill. On the other hand, he observed, that if the penalties should be collected, the bill would succeed as a pecuniary, if it failed, as a military project. &#x2014;Into a comparison of the-merits of the plan said to be in the contemplation of the noble viscount and his colleagues last year, with that now under discussion, he did not think, it necessary to enter; nor if it were necessary, was he competent to it, as he was not acquainted with the entire nature of the noble viscount's plan, as stated in the other house of parliament. One part of it, which he understood to be an augmentation of our black corps, he most cordially approved of, and should thank the noble viscount for carrying it into effect&#x2014;But there was another part from which he begged leave to express his decided dissent, namely, the raising men for rank; this was a system which he would ever deprecate, and one of which ho could not speak but with the most painful sensations, because experience had convinced him of that which he felt it his duty to acknowledge, that in the share which he bore when in his majesty's councils, in advising the adoption of that measure, he acted extremely wrong. He therefore conjured his noble friend (Mulgrave), to reflect upon the nature of that experience, and not allow himself to be led away from any consideration of local interest, or the prospect of local or temporary benefit, again to have recourse to that mischievous system. Feeling as he did with respect to such a system, he could not see without serious, regret from the papers on the table, that some men had been lately raised under it. He had heard some months since, that such a thing was intended, but he had hoped that the change of ministers would have put a stop to it, particularly as his noble friend always appeared to concur507with him as to the consequences likely to arise, or rather inseparable from that mode of recruiting. In defending the measure under debate, he observed, that his noble friend seemed to think that he had drawn a most satisfactory conclusion in favour of this plan, because he had succeeded in exposing the efficacy of the quota bill and the army of reserve bill towards the farther supply of the regular army; but in this he conceived his noble friend to be begging the question, for he denied the bill under consideration to have any tendency to raise men. On the contrary it appeared to him to be merely a bill to raise money. He therefore objected to it, and regretted to observe the resolution of ministers to press its continuance, still more as they seemed to shew no disposition to bring forward any proposition for the efficient increase of our regular army. There was a plan to which he took occasion to allude in the course of the last session, he meant the recruiting of men for general service for a limited term. To this plan ministers did not then declare any objection, but merely required time to consider of it; of this time they had since had enough, and yet no intention was manifested on their part to bring the plan before parliament; but rather from what had been said to-night, it was clear that impediments would be thrown in its way, if it was submitted to the house; and noble lords had said, that this plan had been tried already, and found to be unsuccessfull; but he contended that it never had a fair experiment in the case alluded to. It must become the general, settled understanding among the public, that this is to be the condition of enlistment before it can have such fair opportunity of operation as to form a judgment upon it. There had been so much confusion and perplexity in consequence of the frequent and rapid succession of changes that had of late years taken place in our military system, that a great degree of jealousy, distrust, and uncertainty had prevailed among that class of men who generally entered into the army. Until that class should feel that the mode of enlistment he referred to would be established as a general principle, he did not think the efficiency of the plan could be fully and fairly judged of. Whether, or not it should become necessary in the course of the session to call for higher measures for our military defence, he hoped that a plan, recommended by so508many men of great military experience, and by the obvious principles of human nature, would be brought under consideration. Such a plan, operating in conjunction with the old and simple mode of recruiting, would, it was his firm conviction, he much more effective than all the complicated machinery introduced by the bill under discussion; a bill, the repeal of which would not, as was pretended, involve the necessity of resorting again to theArmy of Reserve Act. This was a bugbear which some noble lords bad conjured up in their fancy. If this bill were repealed, surely the house would not abrogate its legislative functions; and if an additional force were found to be necessary, the house would be free to enter into the subject, and it would be hard indeed if, without much exertion of mind, it should not devise a more efficient project for raising such a force than this bill presented. The question, upon the whole, for the consideration of the house at present, he thought to be shortly this: was an additional force necessary, or was it not? If it was, this bill was useless towards obtaining it; and, if it was not necessary, to allow this bill to continue was pregnant with mischief and danger. Upon this he would rest the whole argument. With these impressions before me, said the noble lord, I have thought it unnecessary as well as improper to argue this measure on personal grounds. I have ever cautiously avoided that mode of treating any public question. It has always appeared to me the more regular, becoming mode, to argue the principle and merits of the measure without any reference to the motives, feelings, or character of the persons by whom such measure is supported or opposed. Such is the line of conduct I have pursued on this occasion. I should be sorry to say that any individuals are influenced in their public conduct by unworthy considerations, and least of all, should I say that which my thoughts would not warrant respecting the individual to whom my noble friend (Mulgrave) has particularly alluded in the course of his observations. My noble friend, feeling hurt by some personal remarks, which he conceived addressed to himself, has thought proper to make my personal conduct the subject of discussion I am accused, if I understand the accusation, of having passed a great part of my life in terms of intimate friendship, with a person of great weight,509and high rank (Mr. Pitt,) and having acted for many years in concurrence with him against an opposition, comprehending persons of great ability and consideration in the country. To this accusation I plead guilty. I have lived from early years in habits of the warmest friendship with the right hon. gent, alluded to, and I do not think there is any thing in the present situation of affairs that is likely, either on his part or on mine, to dissolve that friendship. This opinion is founded upon a conviction of the integrity of my right hon. friend's character and views, and that he holds a similar sentiment with respect to the character and views of any man whom he deems worthy to be his friend. I cannot suffer myself to suppose that he can entertain such an injurious and insulting opinion of his friends, that they should sacrifice their conscience, and abandon their principles, to follow any line of public conduct that lie may think proper to pursue. As to that part of my noble friend's accusation which refers to my present concurrence with persons from whom I formerly differed upon some points, which are now no more; is there any one so little acquainted with human affairs, and with the parliamentary history of this country in particular, as to suppose it a fair subject of censure, in a man to avail himself of the co-operation of any person from whom he can derive honourable support in the attainment of great and desirable public objects? If this principle required illustration, to whom should look with more confidence than to the example of the man to whom my noble friend alluded. It was the fate of that person to act in opposition for many years to several noble persons with whom, on the arrival of that crisis, the commencement of the last French war, he did not hesitate to form a coalition, and one of those noble persons retains to this hour a seat in his majesty's cabinet. Nay more, has not my right hon. friend sought to establish a co-operation in the govt. of the country with that very party, or rather that individual (Mr. Fox) upon my present Connexion with whom my noble friend has taken occasion to congratulate me this evening? When the country had been brought to the brink of ruin, by that weak, incapable, and inefficient administration, which my noble friend and my right hon. friend also so strongly and so justly reprobated, it was the wish of all good men, that an administration should510be formed, comprehending all the talent, ability, and influence which the country furnished, in order to save the stale in the great crisis that menaced it, and which, in my judgment, is still far from being removed. Upon this subject there seemed to be a perfect concurrence among all honest and independent men in parliament, and it was notoriously the expectation and desire of nine-tenths of the people. No. one more cordially embraced the, opinion than my right hon. friend, and if I am accused of an intimate connexion with the hon. person alluded to, what is to be thought of my right hon. friend, who did all in his power, we are told, to introduce the same person into his majesty's cabinet? Is it dishonourable in me to act with this hon. person on points in which we completely agree, while it is deemed honourable in my right hon. friend to have gone into his majesty's closet to advise his sovereign to appoint the same person to one of the highest offices in the state? Can it then be seriously considered inconsistent, or any thing like dishonourable in> me now to act with that illustrious person? No, impossible. Let not my noble friend indulge the idle hope that such a delusion can ever be practised upon parliament or the country. If it were practicable it is extremely impolitic, and something more, at present to attempt it. The crisis which so imperiously called for a vigorous and cordial union is not yet gone by. No man should, under such circumstances particularly, endeavour to promote discord. Rather to conciliate unanimity, than to inflame differences; rather to bury than to revive the recollection of former animosities, is at present peculiarly the duty of every honest man. What, then, should be thought of any man who would attempt to introduce the bane of discord into the councils of his majesty, in order to thwart the wishes of the country&#x2014;in order to form a cabinet upon the principle of personal exclusion? This is a principle, my lords, of which I never can approve, be cause independently of its operation to prevent parliament and the people from enjoying the administration they desired, and which it was their particular interest. to have, it tends to establish a dangerous precedent, that would afford too much opportunity for the operation of private pique against the public interest. I for one, therefore, refused to connect myself with any arrangement that should sanction that511principle, and in my opinion, every man who accepted any office in that administration, is, according to the letter and spirit of the constitution, responsible for its character and construction, and the principle upon which it is founded. Having said so much as to the manner in which the present administration has been formed, I again repeat, that it is my wish to treat the question before the house rather on public than personal grounds. I do not mean to condemn any man, or arraign the motives which actuate his conduct. The few observations which I have thought it necessary to submit in justification of my own conduct, I hope the house will feel, were called for by the pointed manner in which I have been alluded to in the course of the discussion.", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-grenville", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},
{"date": ["1805", "feb", "15"], "content": "said, that even those who saw objections to the act which it was now proposed to repeal, in the first in-515stance, and compared it with some other system, might now with the most perfect consistency vote in favour of that which was established. He thought, therefore, that the charges on that head against his noble friend (lord Sidmouth) and others were totally groundless. The measure had been adopted by parliament, it had laid the basis of a system for the recruiting of the army, and being adopted, it ought to be persevered in, unless something manifestly much more advantageous could be substituted in its place. Nay, though it could rank only as second or third in comparison of another plan, it was better it should be retained than that uncertainty and fluctuation, on a matter so important, should prevail. Besides, the act had not had a fair trial. It had been passed amidst much heat of party. It was not till Nov. that it began to be acted upon, and even under all these disadvantages it had produced a considerable number of men, and if it went on as it had for the last two weeks, the number raised during which was 300 each, it would in a twelvemonth produce 13,000, and that without at all interfering with the other mode of recruiting. He was of opinion that our whole force was equal to the necessity of our situation, and that nothing, was wanting in it, but that the proportion of disposable force should be increased. He approved of the reduction of the militia to the old number of 40,000, on this account, that it would facilitate the enlargement of our disposable force. The army of reserve act had been of the utmost utility, by supplying, in a short time, a greater number of men than any other measure could have done. Experience, too, had shewn that the best means of speedily augmenting the general regular force was to enlist the men, first for limited service, and to this system the government ought to adhere. As to the enlisting men for a limited time, he said, that differences of opinion prevailed among the most intelligent officers. The question had been attentively and impartially weighed by ministers; and no such satisfactory reasons to rely upon its utility had appeared as to justify them in resorting to it. For his own part, he was convinced that it would not be attended with the advantages expected from it. Upon the whole, he thought that the act now in being should be continued; and he trusted, too, that the penalties it imposed for not raising the516men would be exacted; for if it were imagined that they would not, or that the bill would be altogether repealed, no exertions would be made to carry its provisions into effect. And from this cause, perhaps, it had not hitherto been so successful as it would have been, though the experience they had of it should induce the parliament to persevere in it.&#x2014;His lordship then adverted to the remarks of a more personal nature, which the allusions of the noble mover had introduced. He admitted, that in a government like this, differences of opinion must exist, and that such differences though naturally accompanied with occasional warmth or hostility, ought, not to be any bar to men concurring and acting together for the public good. The merits of such unions, however, must be decided by the circumstances under which they arose, and the motives by which they, were prompted. It was not easy to lay down any general grounds on which they could be judged. He would say, however, that if men who had long been in the habits of friendship, confidence, and concurrence in sentiment, on public affairs, and on fundamental points of the constitution, did happen to disagree, their re-union was at least as natural as their separation, and could not afford any ground of suspicion of their integrity and consistency. On the other hand, if those who had been in constant hostility and opposition to each other on all public questions, who had differed on the most essential principles of the constitution, who had opposed each other with no common acrimony in questions supposed to be connected with the very salvation of the state, did happen to form a political coalition, he confessed lie thought such a coalition would be more liable to suspicions than a re-union of those who hardly ever had thought differently, and' hardly at all on fundamental points. When he saw a union formed of those who thus had never agreed in constitutional doctrines, who had entertained such opposite sentiments on questions of peace or war, that the one had declared that peace on any reasonable or honourable terms was the policy to he adopted, and the other maintained that war was the system till a peace was obtained, which no man could have seriously believed to be, in the state of Europe which then existed, attainable; when those who had formed the coalition, too, equally disagreed in their views of517domestic as well as of foreign policy, the one considering as deadly attacks on the liberties of the country those precautions which the other had supported as essential to the preservation of the country&#x2014;such a coalition, he thought, marked it the object of universal astonishment, if not of indignation.&#x2014;Much had been said of widening the basis of the administration; but he confessed, that in looking at the circumstances he had just mentioned, he could not form any expectation that such an arrangement could be permanent or useful. Neither could he consider coalitions with a view to form such administrations as at all compatible with the principles of the constitution. The beauty of our government consisted in the just distribution of the power and influence of king, lords, and commons; but a confederacy of powerful men to dictate the administration, would, in effect, annihilate king, lords and commons, and constitute an aristocratic usurpation, destructive to the balance of the constitution. Such, at least, had been the sentiments once entertained of a celebrated coalition by the noble baron on the other side, and those sentiments, having learned them from him and others, he still retained.

He did not think this measure could ever be said to have had a fair trial, until the penalties incurred by the parishes had been actually levied. It was not that he wanted to commute for penalties the service required, nor to raise an additional tax upon that pretence, but he thought that parliament was bound to uphold the measure, by the strict enforcement of the penalties, before the effect of it could be calculated, It was not improbable that there had been a great deal of indifference and neglect, from the supposition that these penalties would not be levied.

With respect to what had been said that night on the ground of delay, proceedings of the kind involved a kind of trial in the house of commons as well as in that house; of this the case of Mr. Hastings, who was heard in his defence at the bar of that house, was an instance, as was also that of sir Elijah Impey, though the events were different. However, with all possible respect towards the house of commons, he thought, that, in the particular case before them, truth and justice were more likely to be obtained579by pursuing the investigation, as resolved open by their lordships, than by referring it to the commons.

There was no court of justice in his majesty's dominions, that would for a moment entertain the abominable proposition. The act, he believed in his conscience, was passed to prevent persons who were incapable of performing the duties of their office, or who might be immoral characters, from longer holding the situation of a judge. It was a sort of milder punishment than that of impeachment, which was derected to something criminal. When he heard a noble lord make the assertion, that it was most proper that the persons who commenced the investigation should go through with it and come to a decision on the case, he might suppose that the ordinary proceedings of our courts of justice were nearly at an end. He might expect to hear the noble lord come down to the house to-morrow, and move to ever turn the whole system of the justice of the country. The ordinary and established manner of proceeding, was for a grand jury to hear only one side of the question, and on that to find a bill; but then the same persons did not go on to the conviction of the party accused. It would be remembered that in the case of Warren Hastings, the other house, when the charges were alledged against him, gave him an opportunity of being heard at the bar in his defence, before a single article of impeachment was made out against him. They then brought him before this house, which, by virtue of its superior privilege, examined witnesses upon oath. In the case of sir Elijah Impey also, a defence was made at the bar of the other house, and in con-sequence of that defence the charges were set aside. The house of commons therefore were properly the grand jury, who undertook the first investigation of the charge, and either founded a proceeding on it, or rejected the accusation. This was, as it is by its580constitution, the court of justice, the province of which it was to examine the business more minutely, and to come to such a decision as the case might warrant. Notwithstanding, by the word of the act of parliament upon which this proceeding was grounded, the accusation had a right to be begun in either house, yet the idea of the same persons making the first enquiry, so as to sift out the nature of the crime, and afterwards pronouncing judgment upon the case, was so repugnant to every principle of British legislation, that he thought it best to leave the other house an opportunity of taking up the measure, if they should think fit. He was the more inclined to do so, as, if he was not misinformed, the delay which had already taken place in that house was occasioned by the petitions not having been renewed. The short delay which had been proposed would only give them an opportunity to renew the petitions, and then the business would come in its regular course before this house.

{"date": ["1805", "feb", "18"], "content": "said, he had to call the attention of their lordships to a subject of very serious and weighty importance, namely, the matters alleged in charge against one of his majesty's judges in Ireland, Mr. Justice Fox, now under their lordships' consideration. He certainly should have come forward, as he now intended to do, when the subject was last under discussion, were he not prevented from attending by severe indisposition. The case was certainly of a novel description in that house, and, in every point. of view, whether as effecting the individual, the public, the character of that house, and the consideration of its being to form a precedent with respect to the exercise of the highest of all their functions, one of the greatest importance, and it behoved them lo proceed to its consideration in the most serious and deliberate manner. On this head, lie felt it his duty to submit to their lordships his ideas of what was proper and fitting to be done upon the occasion. He did not know that he should have to close what he had to say with, any regular motion. What he should offer, he had ra-536ther their lordships would turn in theft minds, did they deem it of any weight, or receive assistance in the way of discussion from those who were more conversant in the subject than himself, either then, or any future opportunity, than come to any decision upon his propositions, that day. As the case stood, it appeared that several petitions were presented last session, complaining of misconduct on the part of one of the Irish judges in the execution of his high official duty; in considering this proceeding, it was natural to refer to the provisions of those acts of parliament, by which the judges were placed in their present situation. By these the tenor of their offices was good behaviour, they were re-moveable only on the address of both houses of parliament; the case might some before them in the way of judicial proceedings. With the House of Commons there were two options vested: the first to vote an address of removal, in which their lordships would afterwards have to consider of their concurrence; or to impeach the party before the tribunal of that house. In deciding upon the case, as it then stood before their lordships, they should be guided by two leading considerations: first, that of proceeding in the most convenient manner under the circumstances of the case; and, secondly, that such proceeding should be in a way the most analogous to the principles of the constitution. With respect to the first, it would be proper to pause, for a time sufficient to ascertain whether the other house of parliament may not originate a proceeding upon the case, as it may in point of fact? In a case like the present, where the charge was one of positive misconduct, it would be more regular, as well as. more consonant to the former practice, and more conducive to the ends of public justice, to make the application, in the first instance, to the other house, who, as he said before, were invested with the twofold option of proceeding, either by the way of address or impeachment. With respect lo this, it was seriously incumbent upon their lordships to consider of the contingent possibility of the case ultimately coming before them in their judicial capacity, in the shape of an impeachment; in such a case they would have to sit as a court of justice upon that which, in the way now proposed, they should have tried by previous examination; the consequences of this were too obvious to expatiate537upon. In that view of the question, particularly, it would be preferable to let the application, in the first instance, be made to that branch of the legislature which, constitutionally, forms the grand inquest of the nation. By proceeding in the line at present chalked out, the ordinary situation of the two houses would, most probably, be inverted; as, possibly, they may be so placed as to appear, to a certain degree, as prosecutors before the house of commons. In this view of the question, he thought there could be little difference of opinion. He was decidedly of opinion it was preferable to let the matter originate with the other house. It would be for the house to consider, whether or not, in the mode proposed, a degree of wrong might not be offered, either to the interests of the parties, those of justice, or to the rules prescribed by the constitution. In pursuing the course he recommended, they did not in the least renounce those powers which the acts of parliament vested in them. He again pressed the general importance of the subject to their lordships' minds; and these considerations attending upon the case being entirely new, on this ground, he rather wished the house would come to no decision that night, but take time to consider the case in all its views and bearings. In this view, and with reference to what he had said of the probability of the other house taking it up, he thought it would be proper to adjourn the. sitting of the committee, which stood for to-morrow, for six weeks or two months, or rather, that no particular time should be fixed for its sitting; this to be done so as that the parties might understand that the. delay was for no other purpose than to afford them an opportunity of addressing, themselves to the other house of parliament; this delay, in fact, would not operate as an impediment to, nor a denial of justice; for, at the expiration of the period, the parties would have just the same opportunity of redress with that house as at present; however, in order to give effect to what he had laid down, and to give their lordships time to consider what he had suggested, he should take the liberty of moving, that the order for the committee sitting to-morrow be discharged, and a similar order made for Thursday.", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-grenville", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},

It was a rule which ought always to fee most rigidly adhered to, never to suspend theHabeas Corpus Actexcept in cases of the last extremity. Now, he would ask, was there586an insurrection in Dublin? Was the danger so very imminent that no inquiry could be entered upon in consistency with a proper regard to the salvation of the country? Was a rebellion actually raging in Ireland? If there was nothing of this sort, then it was pregnant with the most pernicious consequences to the constitution, to agree to this measure without an enquiry. Inquiry would compromise the lives of no witnesses; it might be conducted with the greatest caution. No danger could be apprehended from it to the country. It would destroy no sources of intelligence, and upon no possible supposition could it reasonably be considered as calculated to produce any harm, la the course of last war no less than seven or eight enquiries had been instituted, and not one of them was attended with any pernicious consequences. It was true that this was not a new measure, it had been passed on the spur of the occasion, when a formidable insurrection was said to prevail in Dublin. No inquiry had been appointed at that time, nor, indeed, was there time for any in the light in which the danger then appeared. But as there was no inquiry at the original passing of this measure, so much the more occasion was there for an enquiry at this time. The ministers rested their arguments for this bill upon the notoriety of the case. Was such an insurrection in Ireland, why was not this fairly stated? If the disaffection was such as to render this measure necessary, why was an inquiry refused? So far was the disaffection in Ireland from being notorious, that no allusion was made to it in the King's message. On, the contrary, the constant assertion had been, that it was in a state of tranquillity. It was now said to be notorious for disaffection. For this, however, there was, nothing but the assertion of ministers. These were not grounds for the house to act upon. Parliamentary evidence of the necessity of the measure was requisite, before any consent could be constitutionally given, unless in a case of ultimate necessity. No such case existed in the present instance, or indeed was even attempted to be stated. He begged however, that their lordships would not misunderstand him. Whether or not insurrection or even Strong disaffection existed in Ireland he knew not. God knows, said his lordship, that as a private individual, I am much in587the dark en this subject, and certainly, as a member of parliament, I am completely ignorant respecting it. Many respectable lords who are members of this house, and who have, come from Ireland, have told us that there is a necessity for this measure. With me certainly their testimony is not without its proper weight. In deference to what they say, I am willing to admit that there may be a strong probability that the measure may be necessary. But as a member of parliament, I know nothing of the matter, and therefore it, is, that an inquiry appeals to me of so much importance. In what situation then am I placed? I cannot say that the bill is not necessary. Ought I therefore, to allow it to pass without any inquiry? No certainly. As. I, as a member of parliament, know nothing of the matter, the burden of the proof lies upon these who propose it. The plain line of conduct for me to pursue then would appear to be not to shew that it is not necessary, but to give it my opposition, because it has not been proved to me that it in necessary. His lordship concluded with saying, that there was, at all events, no parliamentary ground for agreeing with the recommendation of the noble lords on the other side, and, in the absence of all such proof he could not agree to dispense with the established orders of the house. If it should happen that the act should expire before evidence of the renewal reached Ireland, he presumed the government there would know so much what was required of them, as to continue it in force for a few days, and he knew that in doing so they would be indemnified by parliament.

It had been stated that Ireland was at this time in a situation of great tranquillity, that there were no disturbances, no insurrection in that country. That such appearances might exist there he would not pretend to deny. But experience had taught us, that appearances were not to be trusted to. Every noble lord who heard him must recollect, that at a time when Ireland was understood to be in a state of the most profound tranquillity, when the people were said to be perfectly loyal, and when theHabeas Corpus Actwas not suspended, that an event the most alarming and disgraceful that ever occurred in any country took place, that a dreadful insurrection broke out with circumstances of the foulest and most aggravated atrocity, and which were followed by the murder of one of the most upright and respectable magistrates who ever presided in a court of justice; such was the secrecy with which conspiracies had been carried on in Ireland, that a state of apparent tranquillity could never be considered as a proof of the loyalty of the people. And whatever might be said of Ireland at this time, it was well known that numbers of disaffected persons were still to be found there, and that they carried on a traitorous correspondence with others of their countrymen residing in France is lord-ships next took occasion to allude to the objection that had been made against reading the present bill in all its stages on the same day. He could not see how any well founded objection could be urged against a proceeding of this kind which, had often been adopted on former occasions. He well remembered that the noble lord opposite to him (Grenville) had in the month of April, 1798, brought in a bill to suspend theHabeas Corpus Actin England, without any previous parliamentary inquiry; and that the bill was carried through all its stages on the same day. There were apparently no more grounds for such a proceeding at that time than at present. Yet it was a proceeding in which parliament concurred almost unanimously. Several times since that period it was not thought necessary to institute any inquiry upon which a measure of this kind could be grounded. But noble lords should recollect, that notice had been given of the intention of ministers to propose the reading of this bill in all its stages; and that589notice having been received by their lordships constituted an order of the house, which amounted to an acknowledgment that such a proceeding was perfectly consistent with the visages and orders of parliament. There was nothing therefore, objectionable in what had been done: there was nothing out of the common order of parliamentary usage, and all objections must come with still less force when the shortness of the time was considered, and the necessity for passing this act. He should, therefore, conclude by assuring the noble lord, that it was the unalterable determination of ministers to have the bill read that very night in all its stages.&#x2014;Their lordships then divided on the motion of Lord Hawkesbury; contents 41; non-contents 13; majority 28.", "author_id": "/people/mr-henry-phipps", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},

He was convinced, the ends of justice would be more satisfactorily answered, by suffering the business to539proceed in its present course; not only in this, but in point of expedition, it was infinitely preferable. In any mode of proceeding, the concurrence, or the co-operation of that house would be eventually necessary. As the case stood, the mode recommended by the noble lord would be only productive of further and even injurious delay. The commons could adopt no middle course between a vote of their house, either for redress or impeachment; in the pending interval the character of the individual would remain at stake, and in some degree the administration of justice in Ireland suspended, for, by their single vote, the judicial functions of the individual would not be entirely taken away. Upon the whole, though he differed entirely from the noble baron in his proposition, yet he was not adverse to deferring the farther consideration of the case for a very short time, in order to afford their lordships an opportunity of turning over in their minds what had been respectively thrown out.

This was a provision which he was aware was already strictly attended to in some regiments. But it was highly desirable to render it general, and with that view he would move that none but officers of a certain age should be put on courts martial, and that the president of a court martial should in no case be under 21 years of age. This regulation he thought necessary, although persons under that age might, in some cases, be competent from military experience, to act as members of courts martial.

The hon. mover had said, that no new reason bad occurred since last session against the adoption of this measure. He should, however, rely upon the wisdom and upon the feelings of the house, upon a. measure so interesting and so important to the interests of this country, to our revenues, and even to our existence as a nation. He trusted the house would not consider any former pledge of this642kind as binding upon them now. There were two points of view in which he considered this question; first, as to the policy of the abolition altogether; and secondly, as to the time in which it is now proposed to abolish it, a time so arduous and so critical as the present. First then, he supposed the hon. mover to have great confidence in the measure, but that he now found himself absolutely deficient in the sources of those appeals to the feelings of the house, which he was wont to use on former occasions. He seemed to have nothing new to urge on the score of humanity and benevolence; nothing to say about the cruelty and oppression of the trade, and the inefficacy of all regulations concerning it. No; if he had, he would not have suffered the house to be without them to-night. Since the last regulations were passed, not a solitary instance of their violation could the hon. gent, produce. The surgeons' bounties too had been claimed, he believed, in seven cases out of teu. The house were not called upon now to act from any particular circumstance He believed there was not a member who did not know, that if we abandoned this trade, it would go into other hands. He could prove, that at present there were five American vessels taking in a proper cargo, in order to enable them to carry on the trade to a greater extent. He could wish that evidence and counsel might be heard at the bar of the house; but he hoped the wisdom and justice of the house would render that unnecessary. Did any man consider this as a mere abstract question? No: it Was impossible; every one must see this that its ultimate object was emancipation, and nothing could be more dangerous to our colonial system, than a discussion which involved such a question. Much had been said upon a former occasion about the claims which the Africans had upon out humanity; but he would ask, what claims the native Africans had either upon out justice or humanity? If they had forfeited all claim to the protection of their own laws, what claim had they to the protection of ours? He was entitled to ask this, because there was now no charge made Of kidnapping innocent persons. The principal houses in the trade had established storehouses upon the coast of Africa, where the negroes were collected in considerable in numbers. That; an importation of negroes was necessary to our colonies,643there existed no doubt in his mind, nor could any suppose that the population of the West Indies was sufficient for the purposes for which it was wanted; and, supposing the abolition to take place, the only immediate consequence would be an increase of labour to the slaves upon the islands. Upon the ground of the policy of the abolition, he had heard no argument whatever in its favour, and certainly since, the regulations had been acted upon, it was neither politic, nor expedient. Was it upon the speculations of a few individuals that we were to give up our colonial system, or was this the time, at the moment when we were engaged in an expensive war, which was likely to be of no ordinary duration, to try the effect of speculative opinions; was this the time to move such a question when we had seen the effect which had been produced by similar opinions in a neighbouring isle to our colonies, and when it must be evident to every one what extreme danger would be produced by the spreading of such a spirit in the West Indies? Was not the West Indies a favourite object with Bonaparte, and would he not eagerly seize the advantage which our agreeing to the abolition of the slave trade would throw into his hands? This was evident from his recent conduct. It was, however, of the highest importance that they should consider the extreme danger of holding out speculative opinions to the Blacks, whose co-operation would be pregnant to this country with every possible mischief. He could not avoid considering it as a remarkable circumstance, that, notwithstanding this question of abolition was brought forward, government had contracted for 5000 slaves, who were destined for military services; a contract too which would not expire till February next. Such a measure seemed to hold out that one might buy a slave for a military use, but not for a civil use. He agreed in the propriety of having corps of black troops in our service in our Colonial possessions, but when it was proposed to abolish the slave trade altogether, such a measure was certainly inconsistent with the object of the abolition, He would now ask if the result of the abolition (supposing it to be carried, which he hoped it would not) should be such as had been predicted by those best informed upon the subject, namely, nothing less than the abolition of our colonial system, should we in that case be so644well able to cope with our enemies, bereft of the vast resources which we derived from our colonies, and would not every man in the country, and every member of that house, be called upon to pay his share of this large deficiency, which such a defalcation would cause? Let the house consider the number of men who were employed in consequence of this trade, and the benefits which resulted from it to our manufactures. Besides, how could those who formed an opinion here upon the subject be better judges than the planters themselves? But it was said that some of the planters agreed to the propriety of the abolition. This might be the case, but it should be recollected, that the abolition would throw the property and concerns of our colonies into the hands of those who had large capitals, for such only could support it; and therefore the concurrence of some of those was rather an argument against the abolition. But, whatever might be the opinion of a few of the planters, the house of Assembly of Jamaica, the Representatives of the Island had declared themselves decidedly adverse to the measure of the abolition. Much had been said of the danger of increasing the number of slaves; when that number was compared with the number of Europeans, it certainly appeared very great, and there was no question that if they were united, no military force could put them down, as they might reckon upon the proportion of about thirty negroes to one European. How impolitic, then, was it to raise doubts and questions in their minds upon the subject of emancipation, for to that this question ultimately led, and how pregnant with danger was such conduct to our colonial interests and possessions, particularly at the present moment, when, from the circumstances of a neighbouring island, the Negroes had not only greater inclination to unite, but possessed greater facilities of co-operation. Under these circumstances, it became the house to say at once to the world, that they were resolved not to adopt a system which could only lead to the most injurious consequences, and thus to put an end to discussions which had already, and which evidently must have the very worst effect upon the minds of the negroes. He had some objections to the provisions of the bill, which he should reserve until it went into the committee; at present he should confine himself to objecting to the645principles of the bill, and he was confident that there were many members who formerly voted for the abolition, who would now, under the circumstances in which we were placed, vote against the present bill; he should therefore take the sense of the house upon the subject, lie concluded by moving \"that the bill be read a second time this day six months.\"", "author_id": "/people/mr-isaac-gascoyne", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

But the policy of France and Spain led these powers to continue this trade. During the phrenzy of the revolution in France, the slave trade was abolished, and that measure led to all those horrors which had since occurred in St. Domingo. After the peace, however, or rather the truce of Amiens, one of the first acts of the consular authority was to re-establish the slave trade; and not only this, but every encouragement was given to the subjects of France; bounties were granted upon the importation of slaves, and every facility was established which could promote the increase of the trade. Such was the policy of France at that time, and such continued to be the policy of France at the present moment. This being the case, what would be the effect of our abolishing the trade, but only to throw it into the hands of other nations. If we abolished the trade, it would not be the means of compelling those vessels which were at present engaged in it to give it up; they might, and many of them, no doubt, would continue it under the sanction of other powers. During the short period of the last peace every encouragement was given to British subjects engaged in this trade, to go to France with their vessels; they were allowed to navigate their own vessels with only the regulation of having a nominal French commander, and being engaged to take a number of French apprentices. This evinced the value which was set upon the trade by France, and the same encouragements would, doubtless, be held out in the event of another peace. Spain also gave every facility to the trade; but she was prevented from turning it much to advantage by the want of a commercial navy. She was only prevented, however,646by her inability from participating in the advantages of the trade. If parliament should agree to abolish this trade, what advantage would result from the measure? would there be one slave less?

{"date": ["1805", "feb", "28"], "content": "&#x2014;Sir; in treating of this important question, the hon. mover' has contented himself with saying, that there is nothing new in it. Though we are now engaged in agitating a point which, materially concerns the British empire, though the ruin or salvation of one of its most valuable component parts may depend on the success or the failure of this project of his, he has had the boldness to say, that there is no occasion to hear the arguments of counsel on this subject! There is nothing new, he observes, and therefore he thinks that neither he nor any body else need say any thing about the matter; and, acting upon this opinion, he has given in his negative to calling in the counsel. Nothing new, sir! Has nothing new happened in the situation of St. Domingo? Have the hon. gent. and his friends entirely neglected to turn their attention to the interesting lesson which this island affords? Have they attended to the consequences that have resulted from the measures of emancipation pursued by a set of Jacobins in a moment of political phrenzy? If they have not attended to these things, what are we to think of their preparations for the discussion and management of an affair of this nature? If they have attended to them, can they produce any satisfactory evidence to shew that the same consequences which flowed from the Jacobin excesses, will not follow a similar decree of the British senate, supposing that we should have profited so little by the experience of France, and our own observation, as to pass such a decree? Is there nothing new in the situation of Jamaica? Has the hon. gent, seen the report of the assembly, or did he think it worth his while to read it? The assembly of that Island are so impressed with the pernicious, and absolutely ruinous consequences of this measure, that they have sent a confidential agent to this country, in order to resist, by every means in their power, its progress. When the interests of such faithful subjects of the British em-647pire are concerned, when their whole is at stake, that whole from which they have been ever ready to contribute a part to the exigencies and service of the state, when you are proposing to plunge them into difficulties unknown to any other class of British subjects, and perhaps into utter ruin, is it possible that any man can be so callous to the feelings of justice, to a sense of that attention that is due to British subjects, as to say that these men ought not to be heard in their own defence? This, sir, is treating an important part of the empire with the most marked disrespect. What are they to conclude with regard to the attention paid to their interests, when a member of the British legislature, on an occasion like the present, does not chuse to say a word respecting their complaints? Their consequence to this country in every point of view, certainly entitles them to more respectful treatment. The hon. gent. has only thought it necessary to advert to the precedent of last session, in order to justify his silence. That precedent, sir makes very little in his favour. When we consider the circumstances under which the measure passed this house last session, we shall find that he has no claim to rest much upon that. The attendance, it is notorious, was very thin, and since gentlemen have begun to attend more minutely to all the circumstances of the case, we are not yet without hopes of stopping this bill in its progress through the house. Scarcely 150 Members were present at the discussions last session, and at no one stage of the business were the members above 200. This may be regarded, in some measure, as a presumptive proof, that gentlemen had not made up their minds en the subject. Am I then to be told now, that the precedent of last year is a sufficient reason for the passing of the bill at this time without further examination into its nature and merits? It is a very lame reason indeed, and one which I trust will have very little weight with the house. I hope that the other 458 who have not as yet come forward, will now take a share Mi the matter, and consider the question in a broad and comprehensive point of View and not suffer their judgments to be misled by idle declamation, and vain speculation. I hope that they will attend to all the interests of all the parties concerned in the present instance, and study the means of most effectually promoting them. Without this, sir, it may happen648that while they think they are pursuing a course pointed out by humanity and justice, they will at last find, when it is too late, that they were doing the highest injustice to the one party, without benefitting the other.&#x2014;Having said so much, sir, on this point, I shall proceed to consider the affair more closely. But I could not refrain from saying what I have already thrown out, after the singular line of conduct which has been adopted by the hon. gent. It may be said, sir, that little weight is to be attached to my opinion on this question, because I have a personal interest in the failure of the measure. I Confess, indeed, that I have such an interest, but I am not on this account in a singular situation, nor is it unusual on other questions for members to take apart in discussions where they themselves are particularly concerned, and to have their opinions canvassed with attention. In almost every public measure, some are more concerned than others. But so far are their opinions from being treated with neglect, that they are justly considered as entitled to a fairer scrutiny than those of others, who in the nature of things cannot be supposed to be so well acquainted with the subject. This, sir, ought to be the case in the present instance. Though I am personally concerned, yet my experience entitles me to speak with more confidence than those who cannot be supposed to be so well informed on this particular question. The government of a country has not a right to deal partially and unjustly by a single individual. This, is a principle that has been recognised, and an attention to private justice has often prevented public wrong. If this, sir, be correct, I trust there is no reason why I should not be heard with attention, and have my opinions considered with the same degreee of candour and impartiality, as has been shewn to other persons in similar situations. That a great part of the members of this house have not been present during the discussions of last year has been said already. But the Irish members who have not sat long in this house, have not had an opportunity of attending to the discussions on this question from the beginning. It may not, therefore, be altogether unnecessary. What are we doing in this case? Are we doing justice to those, who are more immediately concerned in the business? It is in vain for you to think of abolishing the649trade. This you cannot do. Transports will pass from island to island, and the trade must be carried on by foreigners, if not by us. It is in vain, therefore, to say, that in this respect, even the negroes themselves can be much benefitted. On the contrary, they may be much injured. But there is another argument which has been used by the hon. gent. He has often adverted to the desolate state of the coasts of Africa compared with the interior of that country. The population of the coast, he has said, is almost ruined, while that of the interior is in the most flourishing condition. On that subject, our means of knowledge are very confined. I, therefore, can know but very little about it. But all, however, that I do know, is from Mungo Park. What does he say? He says that the very reverse is the fact of the case. When he and his companions penetrated into Africa, they found that a general system of war was carried on in the interior. This was exemplified in the case of the war between Abdulkader, king of Foota Zorra, and Famel, king of the Jalofs. The former sent a messenger to the latter, requiring him to embrace the Mahomedan faith. He presented two knives as the emblem of his mission: \"with this knife, (said he) Abdulkader will condescend to shave the head of Famel if he will condescend to embrace the Mahomedan faith, and with this other knife he will cut the throat of Famel, if he does not embrace it;&#x2014;take your choice.\" Famel, however, chose neither to have his head shaved, nor his throat cut, and a war was the consequence. Did those who complained of the treatment of the slaves in the West Indies, attend to the account given of their situation in their own country, as related by Mungo Park? The Jalonkas, as he informs us, are much more cruel to their slaves than the Colonists are, and he gives a shocking instance in the case of Nealee, a female slave. We have, it on the testimony of Sir George Young, that all the freemen in the interior pf Africa are obliged to learn the use of arms. This, undoubtedly, is a proof of the constant warfare in which they are engaged, especially when it is considered that there every feud is hereditary, and that quarrels are handed down from father to son as a family possession. The wars of the Africans are personal, and are therefore carried on with much more rancour than any thing which is known among650us and other civilised nations. This appeared from the history of the wars of the kings of Bambouhe and Bambarra. Mr. Park said that the interior of the kingdoms were populous, while the borders were not, on account of the constant wars that prevailed among themselves. It is also to be recollected, that Mr. Parke's journey to Africa had nothing to do with the subject of the slave trade, but was undertaken for scientific purposes, under the direction of Sir Joseph Banks, to whom the British public owe so much, and whose merits are so well known, and so universally admitted. Mr. Park mentions that in one of the wars when nine hundred captives were taken, only seventy of these were freemen. The feelings of the Mahometans, with respect to the other Africans, might be collected from a cursory story told by the above traveller. When be proposed to go to Tombocto he was advised by a friendly native not to go there. The reason was, that he had been there once; the master of the first house into which he entered had said, if you are a Musselman enter into my house as my guest: if you are a Caffre, I instantly seize you as my slave. Few slaves come from the, coast, they are generally taken from the interior. Gardiner, who belonged to the establishment at Sierra Leone, confirms this. Our African traveller when he sailed up the Gambia, one of the natives offered to traffic with him, and exchange slaves for goods. When informed that the white people did not accept of such a change, he seemed surprised, and said that this was the only means by which they could get their salt from Barbary. We may abandon the trade, but we cannot abolish it, and we shall besides be doing great injury to the Africans themselves. As to the humanity of the case, are we sure that the slaves, are not treated with much greater inhumanity in Africa than in the West Indies? Are they, not driven in their own country like cattle with irons about their necks? the humanity of the African, master is cried up, while that of the British is depreciated. An African master, however, we are told, can coolly toss his slave, when half dead, into a ditch, and say \"there is so much money lost.\" Can any one bring, such an instance against the British, master of the present day? As to their being taken so far from their own country, this is a misfurtune to which the African slaves are always lia-651ble at home; for it is the general policy of Africa to remove the slaves as far as possible from the country in which they were born. Are you to consider this question on narrow grounds? While you think that you are doing more than justice to the negroes, do you reflect that you are certainly doing an act of the greatest injustice to the West India planters? We have been told that there is nothing new in this question; yet it has been confessed by people, of the best authority, that there never was an abler report than that which has lately been made on the subject. Perhaps the hon. gent. has not yet read the papers on the table. If he has read them, however, he cannot be ignorant, that the small settlers, supposing this measure to pass, must certainly remove from Jamaica. If he had taken a fair view of the subject, he would feel that the white men must be driven from the island by a regard for their own personal safety. The disproportion, therefore, between the negroes and the white inhabitants, would be constantly increasing, and would end in the total loss of the island. I do call upon the house to allow those to be heard at the bar who may have been on the spot, who are acquainted with the manners of the negroes, to carry some weight with their sentiments, in considering a point of this nature. A noble lord who had long an opportunity of observing the negroes, is ready to come to the bar of the house, if necessary, and give evidence of the alteration which has taken place in their manners. To what is this alteration owing? It is owing to this, that the idea of abolition is intimately connected in their minds with that of emancipation. The hon. gent. may perhaps say,fiat justitia, fuat c&#x0153;lum.But he is mistaken in the application of this principle, for certainly in the present instance it would only lend to bring the greatest calamity on the negroes themselves. I hope this house will deliberate on this subject as becomes their gravity and dignity as a legislative assembly, and that it will take care not to combine what is essential injustice to the planters in the West Indies, and to the merchants employed in this trade, with certain misery to the slaves themselves. It has been said that our feelings are sed on this subject, and that this misleads our judgment. Our feelings may indeed be roused, but it is a feeling for our all. You may take my life, if you take652the means by which it is preserved. I now come to the last point. I have given but a very slight view of the others, not wishing to tire the patience of the housed But though I have not taken time to do them justice, I did not think it would be proper, under all circumstances, entirely to omit them. The point to which I now wish to direct the attention of the house is, the importance of the trade to the revenue of this country, and on this I shall be short. I moved for documents on this subject, which have not yet been produced. However, I did not call for them altogether with a view to this particular question, but with a view to a motion, at a future period, for an inquiry into the state of the colonics. I shall now, however, be forced to resort to the returns of last session. From these it appears that the imports in 1803, amounted to about 17 million sterling. The article of sugar alone; amounted to 10 million, and the whole was between 16 and 17 millions. The whole of this property is, by these discussions, put in the greatest hazard from an insurrection among the negroes, on account of the inseparable connection in the minds of the negroes between abolition and emancipation? Under these circumstances then, is it not equally impolitic and unjust to allow a measure of this nature to pass? But you also hazard exports to an amount inconceivable. In 1803 fifty-one ships came into Ireland from the colonies, and no less than 129 were sent out of it with cargoes for the colonies, consisting chiefly of linen. By the ruin of the colonies this great market for Irish linens will be almost completely destroyed. I shall only then further observe, that in promoting this measure you are not doing an act of humanity to the negroes themselves, that you are doing the highest Injustice to the colonists, that you are neglecting your revenue, and putting a great part of it in the greatest hazard, and therefore forgetting the interests of your country. The great principle upon which you ought to proceed, is to do justice to every individual. The colonies are entitled to your particular attention, and their complaints ought to be heard with candour, and argued upon with coolness and impartiality. I hope you will not pay regard to any precedents, but consider the case precisely as it comes before you, without regard to what may have been done last year, when there was such a thin attendance. I653have the greatest hopes that the house will view, the question in its proper light, and concur with me in a decided opposition to the second reading of this bill.", "author_id": "/people/sir-william-young-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1805", "feb", "28"], "content": "&#x2014;Sir; I consider it as a duty incumbent on me to oppose this measure with all the ability which I possess. The question is such, that it certainly deserves the most serious deliberation, and the coolest investigation of the house, t trust, therefore, that the reasons urged against the measure will be heard and weighed with all that candour that becomes an assembly such as this. In the opening part of the speech of the gentleman who has just sat down, he said that now or never was the time to put in practice the measure of the abolition. Sir, I see nothing in the present time that, in this respect, peculiarly distinguishes it from former times. At all times, I have thought this a most ruinous measure, and the present time contains nothing to make me alter my opinion. In order to be convinced of the vast importance of this traffic in every respect, we have only to attend to the situation of Liverpool, and compare the state of that city with what it was not more than a century ago. Its population, about a hundred years ago, did not exceed 2,500. This population carried on its trade in about 100 barks. Its capital was then about 10,000l. What is its state now? It employs no less than about 5,000 ships,655manned by a proper compliment of seamen, the best and most expert in the British Navy. Its population is between 80 and 90,000, and its capital consists of the number of its former thousands turned into millions. Yet it is certain that this amazing prosperity is almost entirely owing to the slave trade. This is certainly a curious time to put an end to the source from which the wealth and grandeur of a considerable city in the Empire is derived. Bonaparte has said that we cannot contend with him single-handed: now, however, he is backed by Spain, and in all probability, Portugal will soon be ranged en his side. Are not, I would ask, our principle means of security derived from our seamen, and these are in a great measure, at least many of the best of them, procured by the trade of Liverpool. It is not a little astonishing, therefore, to hear any one say that this is the time for abolishing a trade which supplies us with so many seamen. Is the time when we are engaged in such a war as the present, a war in which so many seamen are required, upon whom we rest as our chief security, is this a time for such a measure as this, a measure that goes to complete the ruin of one of the chief nurseries from which our seamen, and consequently our measures of security, are in a great measure derived. This measure, sir, is certainly founded on the opinions respecting the rights of man, which have produced so much horror and devastation all over the world. It is a remnant of Jacobinism. I am sure that the hon. gent. who urges it, is not in his heart a Jacobin, but still the effect of his conduct is the same as if he were one. I shall beg leave to mention a story to him, in which I was myself concerned: I went to Paris in 1791 out of curiosity. Having arrived there, I was anxious, like most strangers, to see what was going forward. Among other things I wished to go to visit the jacobin club. But a friend, who knew the place bitter than I did, dissuaded me, saying, \"Oh! my dear sir, you must not think of going there, you have opposed the abolition of the stave trade, and consequently are regarded as an abomination by the Jacobins, and you might be in danger of your life. At the same time I was given to understand, that if the hon. mover of the measure had appeared in that club, he would have been bailed with peculiar pleasure; the president would have given656him the fraternal hug. I was really told that a diploma of jacobinism was absolutely sent to that honourable gent. I am convinced that the principles of Jacobinism are those upon which this measure is founded.", "author_id": "/people/mr-banastre-tarleton", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

How this can be reconciled with the conduct of the right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer on the present occasion, I am utterly at a loss to conceive. This is supporting a measure in one way, and opposing it in another. An hon. gent. had said that this was the proper time for abolishing the slave trade. This, sir, is in complete contradiction to the report of the assembly at Jamaica. This is not the proper time for this measure. There has not as yet been sufficient time for one of the parties to be heard. An hon. gent. has said that sufficient evidence has already been given. But this evidence has not been given on oath. Another reason against the abolition is that the plantations, especially the small ones, must absolutely be given up in case it is effected. It has been said, that foreign nations had given indications of abandoning this traffic. It is very easy for them, to be sure, to give it up, since they have lost almost all their colonies, and therefore have very little need of slaves; but is that the situation of this country? Another disadvantage which would result from the adoption of this measure is, that in such a case, we could scarcely find agents to manage our property in the West Indies. The great inducement to them for going out, is the chance of being able to procure slaves, and commence planters on a small scale at first for themselves. Unless a prospect of this kind is held out, it is certain that no people will remain in the colonies, avert for the management of our best estates. An hon. gent. has adverted to the want of compensation in this bill. Certainty it does happen, that in a bill that goes to deprive so many people of their property, there is not one clause to indemnify the sufferers, or their losses. Would this have been done even in a common turnpike bill? If the hon. gent. had proposed such a thing he would have been scouted from one end of the house to the other; and can the house be so indifferent respecting the colonies, that any person dares bring in a measure to treat them with such injustice, and by listened to with patience?657He would not dare to propose to meddle with English property in this manner. The only mode in which he could proceed would be this; he would say to the persons whom it might be thought necessary to deprive of their property&#x2014;we want your land for public purposes; we will pay down to you the value. Some men who would be obliged to attend to reason in common instances at home, still dare to bring forward oppressive measures respecting islands at 3000 miles distance. The situation of the negroes has been the subject of complaint. Is not the situation of the poor in this country in many instances worse than that of the negroes? Without meaning to boast, I have given permission to my own negroes to cultivate considerable spots of ground for themselves, and ample time for this purpose. I have lodged and clothed, and have engaged a physician to attend and prescribe to them. I have done every thing for their comfort. Can the hon. gent. say that he has done so much, with all his talk and noise about humanity, for the peasantry of Yorkshire? I do not wish to impute any unworthy motives to the supporters of the bill, but I am convinced, that as the man who pretends to more courage than another has generally less, so he who pretends to more religion than others, is often the greater cheat.", "author_id": "/people/mr-john-fuller", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

It was not from any want of consideration that his mind had not been changed; on the contrary, he had bestowed uncommon attention to the consideration of this question, from the circumstance of having the misfortune to differ in opinion from many hon. friends of his, and from some who possessed the most distinguished talents and highest endowments; he, at the first, thought the measure impracticable, and he thought so still, and he thought, moreover, that the cause of humanity had not been at all promoted by the agitation of the question, and was not likely to be benefited by its further discussion.

There was certainly a considerable difference of opinion, as to this bill. Some said it might be highly dangerous in its consequences; others, that it could not fail to be very advantageous. It was however ascertained, that the slave trade had been very advantageous to the West India islands. This bill was built on theory, and he was not fond of theories; they had been productive of too much mischief. The real fact was agreed upon by all parties to be this: the West Indies cannot be cultivated by Europeans, whose constitutions will not bear fatigue in that climate. It is therefore necessary, if they are to be cultivated at all, that it must be by some other class of the human species, who being natives of warm climates, are able to endure that degree of labour and fatigue which no Europeans could do in that climate. This being the acknowledged fact, the question, is, shall we abandon the cultivation of the West India islands altogether, or what class of the human species shall we employ to, cultivate them? Some say, that it is much better to employ free negroes than slaves, and that the labour of freemen would be more productive. This is, however, only a supposition, a mere theory, The fact is known to be, that the natives of warm countries are not naturally disposed to labour. In warm countries the climate produces the means of subsistence with so little labour, that they have no necessity, and consequently no inclination, for laborious work; and for that species of labour which was necessary for raising sugar and659other Colonial produce, it was obsolutely necessary to use something of compulsion. It might appear to some to be a great hardship to compel men to labour, but it was the common condition of the lower orders of society. It was by compulsion that we made our sailors go on board our ships, and this sort of compulsion was often very proper and necessary. As to the general management of the slaves in the West Indies, he could assert, from his own knowledge and means of information, that they were universally much better treated now than they were formerly, and that there has been as great a disposition as possible evinced to encrease them in the natural way. As to the Creoles, although they were superior for generation, they were inferior to the Africans in ability to labour, and it was found that they gradually grew weaker. It might, therefore, well be said, that experience has taught us that we cannot go on without the continued importation of those African slaves; and the only question would be, whether or not we were, in abandoning the trade, abandoning the cultivation of the West India islands altogether. He had often remembered to have heard many splendid theories advanced in that house, and supported with eloquence, which went off altogether, or were not found to answer. Eloquence was not always a proof of the justice of the cause, which it so powerfully supported. The great duke of Marlborough was certainly a very superior man, and a man of most excellent judgment, but he was never famous for his eloquence; he, however, had discrimination, and Weighed matters well; he knew what measures should be adopted, and what should be avoided. This was more than many eloquent men knew. To speak eloquently, and to judge rightly, were very different things. If it were merely to talk of humanity and justice, and those popular topics, the task would be easy; but in the present instance the considerations were more important, as involving the great interests of the country, and that humanity and justice which was due even to numbers of bur Own people to whom the West India trade gave employment. As to all the arguments that had been urged on account of the present situation of affairs in the West Indies, he thought them of no Importance. Although we are now at war, out enemies cannot take up the trade, yet we cannot suppose that we are to be always at war, and if the trade was now abolished, as soon as peace should660be restored, the French might again take up that trade which we would so imprudently have thrown away. Those arguments, that were only built on temporary circumstances, were not entitled to much weight. An hon. gent. had spoken of the danger that Would arise of convulsions and insurrections, from the continual importation of labourers from Africa. It appeared to him that the danger lay on the other side. If you were to stop all future importation, such a measure must give a very strong turn to the minds of the negroes now upon the islands: they might well say, if you think that the situation of slaves is so dreadful, that you will not allow any more of our countrymen to be made slaves, why are we to continue slaves still? If the abolition of the trade rests entirely on the reasons of humanity and justice, the same principles would lead as far as entire emancipation. If then, by abolishing the trade, you could convince the negroes in our islands, that their state was much more shocking than ever they had before considered it, the only consequence would be, that they would be more ripe for insurrection, which would bring an additional danger upon the colonies, From these considerations, he could not avoid opposing the second reading of the bill.", "author_id": "/people/sir-william-pulteney", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

The hon. baronet had talked a good deal about splendid theories Which had been, at different times brought forward in that house, and powerfully supported by eloquence, and which were afterwards dropped. For his part, he Was Utterly at a loss to conceive what splendid theory it was which the worthy baronet alluded to; but it appeared to be aft inference, which he chose to draw from his general positions, arid from his story of the Duke of Marlborough, that eloquence was So contrary to discrimination and judgment, that whenever the house heard an opinion eloquently and Well supported, they should, oh that account, rather presume it to be wrong. This would, indeed, be a very strange conclusion, and yet it followed, as clearly as possible, from what had fallen from the worthy bayonet. This great dread of eloquence was not peculiar to the worthy baronet. The Jacobins of France had also been much afraid of it was one of their maxims that there was661no sort of Aristocracy so dangerous as the Aristocracy of talents. The hon. baronet appeared to have imbibed that maxim, but he would hardly convince, the house, that the better they heard a measure supported, the more suspiciously they should receive it, and the more inclined they should be to consider it only a splendid theory. But what was the theory in the present instance? Was it a theory that the West India islands were in a very alarming State? This was a thing, however, which would be granted by every body, and which had in fact been universally granted. Was it a theory that the trade was bad in itself, and contrary to justice and humanity? Instead of theory, it was a positive fact, on which the supporters of the bill had rested their arguments. It was acknowledged on all sides, that there was an alarming disproportion between the numbers of the blacks and of the Europeans in the West Indies. It is allowed that there are at least 30 blacks to 1 white, and that from this great disproportion of numbers much mischief had already arrived, and much danger was apprehended. It can therefore hardly be called a theory to wish to diminish this danger, by diminishing that disproportion from which it arose. It was now 12 or 13 years since the house had come to a resolution for gradually abolishing the slave trade, and yet many of those who voted for this gradual abolition had hitherto opposed every measure which tended to carry into effect that re solution, and many of those who then saw the greatest danger from the disproportion between the black and white population, can now consent that this danger shall be constantly increasing with increasing disproportion. As to the war not being likely to last for ever, and the view of the question when peace should be established, he must say, he hoped as much as any gent, that the war would not last long, yet he must say, that if the solemn resolutions of the house of commons were to be carried into effect at all, the war certainly presented no difficulty, on the contrary he was sure that while the war continued, the argument could never apply on which the opponents of the bill placed their principal reliance, for certainly we could not be supplied with slaves by French or Spanish ships, as long as we were, at war with those nations. The hon. gent. concluded with observing, that it was most material that the house of commons should again declare its opinion upon this trade; there662must be a strong hope that an opinion so gravely delivered, and which had been so often repeated, would at length make a powerful impression on the public mind, and would be adopted.", "author_id": "/people/mr-charles-fox-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

Now, if these gentlemen were sincere in their declaration, that the slave trade was contrary to justice and humanity, and that a gradual abolition of it was practicable, he hoped some of them would do what none of them had yet offered, in the event of this bill being lost, which was to propose some plan of their own, for such an abolition as they thought practicable, and suitable to the present time; and he assured them they should have his assistance in any measure of that nature, if it should appear to him to be in any degree reasonable; this he hoped some of these gentlemen would do, if they were in earnest in their professions on the slave trade. He took notice of this observation* of an hon. hart, (sir Wm. Polteney) who had considered this subject as a theory, and he said, that the objection to the bill as a theory was an objection which might as well have been, and indeed Had been applied to all the regulations which took place in the trade, such as those in the middle passage, and other provisions of the like nature. He remembered the house was told when these regulations were before it, they would be the means of raining the trade; it might as well be proposed to abolish it at once, for all the horrors of the abolition would come upon them directly if these regulations were adopted; the regulations were adopted however, and in a few months afterwards the planters acknowledged the670plan of them highly beneficial to their, interests; and now they used the adoption of that plan as an argument against the abolition; and the very same arguments they used against the regulations which they now profess to admire, they now use against the abolition; all this, change in the sentiments of the planters, had taken place within 2 years; for these reasons he trusted the hon. baronet, who, by the way, had not always been so great an enemy to theory on every occasion, as he had professed himself to be to-night, would not persist in his opposition to this measure on that account, and he thought it extraordinary that men of such acute understanding as the hon. baronet possessed, should fall into such an error as this; the hon. baronet, in his dislike to theory, had overlooked the main argument on. which this measure was supported. He did not consider chat the population of the islands could be kept up by natural means, without any fresh importation, which had been proved to the house in detail by figures long ago, by accounts from the islands themselves. Whether tire, hon. baronet had paid any particular attention, or not, to the matter, most indisputably the fact was so; that after all the resolutions should have been adopted which had been proposed, the population of negroes in the islands would keep up so as to supersede the necessity of any fresh importation, was a matter not now disputed. It had been clearly established in America that the population of this description doubled in 20 years. The same effect under the same regulations, would take place in the West Indies. He would not say what the consequences would be of adopting the plan he now proposed to the house, bat if any one would read the report of the Jamaica assembly, which he had read with attention, he thought such a person would not readily say this plan would make the condition of that island worse than it was at present, with respect to its negroes; a situation into which they had brought themselves, for want of pursuing a plan similar to that which was intended to be tried under this bill, and which situation might be said to be that of being nearly in the jaws of destruction; a great deal of this evil arose from the practice of those who were called the book-keepers, to whom this trade of importation was a profitable concern, and he believed to them only, but the general sys-671tem of it was as injurious to the true policy of the islands as the trade itself of importation from Africa was. repugnant to justice and humanity. It had been so clearly established to be impolitic to continue the system in Jamaica, that a gentleman of great discernment had advised them in that island to drop it, or suspend it for a while, as the only means of getting rid of a great deal of embarrassment, as had been done with effect in North America; indeed, it was nothing more than proving the truth of the old proverb, \"that honesty is the best policy;\" and he was persuaded, that however some men might flourish for a while, they would, by neglecting that maxim, find themselves in the end overtaken by absolute poverty. He recommended this Jamaica report to the house, by which they would see the foundation on which he made these observations. In the course of 20.years the number of executions for debt ascended to 80,000, and amounted to 22&#x00BD; millions sterling. He left gentlemen to consider how far this might with propriety be called in a national sense a ruinous concern, and that therefore a general policy was against it, and to reflect on the propriety of making these public sacrifices to the private interests of these few book-keepers and individuals who benefit by the system. It was said, there was nothing new to be advanced upon this subject; that he denied. There was much that was new to be said, but it was not necessary for him to say it at present; but he hoped the house, in some future stage of this business, would be perfectly acquainted with all that was to be found in the papers now before it, and that would give them a proper idea of the slave trade, as it related to the condition of the bulk of the West India negroes. He had never considered it on that ground, because he did not think the case rested on that point, and he had abstained from the discussion of that topic, because he knew it was likely to produce irritation, and make parties in the house acrimonious against each other; but what he said was this, that the general state of the negroes in the West Indies would never be materially improved, if the African importation was permitted to continue; they would always be in a state of degradation, below that which ought to be the lot of the human species; they were like cattle, under the whip, in which improvement was impossible, nothing being applied to them but brutal672force, they could never possess any but brutal manners, so they must always, under such a system, remain, degraded in the estimation of others, and their own, receiving no moral instruction or improvement from the society in which they lived, or rather from which they were excluded; this prevented them from endeavouring to improve themselves, or their condition. He had endeavoured on various former occasions to impress upon the house the advantages likely to result from changing this system, by shewing that the abolition of the slave trade from the coast of Africa would have many very beneficial effects. It would make it the obvious interest of the master that the slave should be kept with as much care as possible, because his place could not be supplied; that after this, means would of course be adopted to take care of the health of every negro, and also of his moral improvement; encouragement would be given to marriage, and other legitimate objects would be pursued, by which they would become populous, industrious, intelligent, moral, and happy; by which we should have a powerful, though laborious and obedient peasantry; instead of a degraded race of beings, actuated only by a brutal impulse; but the house might believe him, they were capable of much improvement; it was dangerous to keep them in this state long; they were capable of reflecting on their physical, powers; they might be brought to feel how they might be able to destroy those who made or kept them captive. They might become possessed of that knowledge. There was reason to apprehend, that they would form plans, and devise means for carrying them into execution. They could see a distant object with clearness and pursue the means of arriving at it with vigour, and at the same time with patience. He would have gentlemen, who wished to continue this trade, reflect upon these matters, and take care they did not mistake the matter; for these negroes may reflect on their own situation long enough before they have in their own hands the remedy for their slavery; and if they took it by force, it would be done in a manner very different from that in which those who were their present masters could wish. And here he did not wish to avoid that part of the subject on, which the opponents of the abolition dwelt so much; he meant the eventual emancipation of the negroes in the West Indies. He had never concealed that his hope was673that such might be the ultimate effect of the abolition of the African importations but that was a period, the distance of which ha had never attempted to calculate, although his opponents had charged him with having it immediately in view. Had that been his object, or even his hope, he should deserve the word humane to be added to his views; but a shorter one, and that was the word mad, ought to be applied to his object; but although he felt that the immediate emancipation of the negroes in the West Indies could not be expected, for that before they could be fit to receive freedom it would be madness to attempt to give it to them, yet he owned he looked forwards, and so he hoped did many others, to the time when the negroes in the West Indies should have the full enjoyment of a free, moral, industrious, and happy peasantry. Nothing was to be expected from the colonial government: and in the open confession the assembly had made, it had dealt fairly with the house. As far as regarded that institution, no co-operation was to be expected, but this disgraceful traffic was to proceed as long as the patience of parliament, and he would add, the mysterious ways of Providence, would permit its continuance. Let, then, said the hon. gent. the house pause, and contemplate its present duties; the opportunity now offered may never return, and if the present moment be neglected, events may occur which will render the whole of the West India islands one general scene of devastation and horror. The storm is fast gathering; every instant it becomes blacker and blacker.

The hon. officer, with reference to the word \"apprehended,\" remarked, that it could only be applicable in the case of Mr. Bartholomew being a deserter. That that gentleman was not so considered, either before or since his being impressed, he thought it unnecessary to say more than this, that previous to his being impressed, Mr. Bartholomew corresponded with lord St. Vincent, and if he had been deemed a deserter, it was fair to presume, that his letter would not have been answered by the admiralty, and after Mr. Bartholomew's being impressed, he was taken on board the Zealand, from which he was transferred to the Inflexible. No proceedings had ever been taken with respect to this gentleman, and he was now a lieutenant on board the Inflexible. This ship, it was known, was under the command of a friend and relation of lord St. Vincent; and he would put it to the house, whether it was probable that Mr. Bartholomew could hold such a rank on board, had he been considered guilty of desertion? Whether the usage of the navy bore him out in the original discharge of Mr. Bartholomew and the other midshipmen, was not now the question; but he submitted to the candid consideration of the house, that as Mr. Bartholomew was not in fairness to be deemed, and he had not, in fact, been treated as a deserter, so the word \"apprehended,\" which implied that, was not applicable to him.", "author_id": "/people/sir-home-popham", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

The house, he was sorry to say, was not put in a state to judge so accurately on the subject as it ought to have been. Certain accounts had been ordered by act of parliament to be annually laid before the house. It was true, that they were not in strictness required to be laid on the table previous to the 25th of March; but since the budget had been brought forward so early this session, it might have been expected that the accounts deluded to should, have been presented in time sufficient to enable the house to examine the subject with the requisite degree of information. We wanted an account of the public income and an account of the disbursements. The distribution paper ought also to have been presented sooner, with an account of the consolidated fund, A confusion also arose from its being stated that the expenditure would be 44 millions, and provision was made only for 35 millions. Then, there was a million for the East India Company.563He assented to that sum. But he did it for reasons of his own, arid not for those alleged on the other side. The East India Company had engaged to pay 500,000l. annually to the public; and instead of that, this was the second time that they called upon the public to pay money to them. Notwithstanding this, it was contended on the other side, that the East India Company was in a flourishing condition, and we had recorded this by our vote, He hoped the subject would be at another period more fully investigated. There was also another resolution to which he was by no means inclined to give his assent. It was that which went to give 5 millions for subsidies to the continental powers. He trusted that no one would think that he contended that this island should keep aloof from continental connexion. The man did not deserve a seat in that house who could wish this island to be insulated in its interests and connexions, from the powers on the Continent, or who would not be desirous of contributing all in his power to diminish the preponderating influence of France upon the greater part of Europe, which he could not consider otherwise than as one family. He would therefore, chearfully grant any sum, which was likely to be applied with any effect to the diminution of the enormous power of the enemy; but, before he voted such a sum as this, he should expect to sec some prospect of accomplishing his object, by the co-operation of those powers bordering on France, such as Austria and Prussia; but, without this aid, he could anticipate very little effect from powers so remote from it as Russia and Sweden To expect a reduction of the power of France, by means of such allies, would be as wild and romantic As the. measures said to be taken by some of the agents of England, who attempted to accomplish their purpose by the force of two bottles of sympathetic ink, and the sum of 500 guineas&#x2014;.He also had great objections to the duty on salt. This house had voted, about four years ago, that it was highly impolitic to tax that commodity. It was strange now that it was proposed to tax it doubly. This he supposed was the difference between a weak and inefficient administration, and a strong and vigorous one. Another objectionable tax was that on horses used for husbandry. The right hon. gent, had lately given his assent to a bill which had for its object to courage564agriculture, and now he came forward with a resolution of this nature! Two years ago, when the war had commenced, the house had been pompously told, that the war would be carried on by 12 million of war taxes, without borrowing a larger sum than was annually reduced by the sinking fund. He, on the contrary, had stated, that the expenditure would amount to 42 millions, when our force was carried to its utmost extent, and that we should be compelled, to borrow 23 millions. The result now was, that our whole expenditure this year was upwards Of 49 millions, and amounted to 44 millions independently of the subsidy, and that the loan, in place of 7 millions, was 22&#x00BD; millions for England, and 2&#x00BD; millions for Ireland.", "author_id": "/people/mr-george-johnstone", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

He would not say, that nothing was now owing by government to the Company; but he could not help remarking, that the 500,0001. which they had covenanted annually to pay the public, was never stated to have been actually so paid but once. But, in fact, there was no parliamentary evidence of the existence of the debt. The house had, indeed, the word of a right hon. gent, that it was so; but that was not a parliamentary ground Upon which they had a right to dispose of the public money; and it was evident to him, that neither the former nor the present sum ought to be paid without a parliamentary inquiry, and a satisfactory proof being given to the house of the existence of the debt. If it was proved that the debt did originally, exist, the house would then have to inquire, whether or no it was liquidated, or nearly liquidated.

If the committee had fallen into an error, he was sure nothing could be further from the intention of the noble lord who had presided in that committee; nothing could be further from the intention of the committee themselves, than that the house should sacrifice their integrity for the purpose of maintaining them in an opinion proved to be erroneous. The right hon. gent. had expatiated largely on the conduct of the sheriffs, he only hoped, that if it ever fell to that right hon. gent's lot to have the honour of filling the office of sheriff, he might execute the duties of his situation with as much credit and propriety as the gentlemen who were now the subjects of discussion. After the very luminous speech which the house had heard from the learned counsel at the bar, he should abbreviate what he had to say as much as possible. The hon. gent. here entered into an examination of the report of the committee, and of the evidence on which that report was founded. He asserted, that although there might be 30 or 40 bad qualifications for votes on the part of Sir F. Burdett, there were ten times as many on the other side. The committee had struck out 600 votes indifferently on both sides, because the voters had not been assessed to the land-tax. The papers on the table proved that the sheriffs had refused votes for Sir F. Burdett as well as for Mr. Mainwaring: 128 votes admitted by them for the last-named candidate were struck off by the committee, because they were official, and not freehold votes. Could any circumstance rebut the charge of partiality more strongly than this? He reprobated the conduct of the right hon.849gent. in deluging with criminality one of the most immaculate characters that ever existed; he alluded to Mr. Birchall, on whose talents and virtues the shadow of suspicion had never before rested, he praised the conduct of the sheriffs in waiting an hour after the poll had closed, for the purpose of allowing the defeated party to demand a scrutiny. He confessed he was of opinion that no gentleman who had examined the whole of this complicated subject, could conscientiously vote for the motion. The question was not, whether or not the sheriffs should be committed to Newgate, or what should be the quantum of punishment; but whether or not the house would sacrifice their dignity to support a committee evidently in error, so evidently to him, that he firmly believed, if they went back to their room, and reexamined their report they would themselves feel the necessity of correcting it.", "author_id": "/people/mr-peter-moore", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

His lordship went through the whole of the evidence on the table of the house, reading extracts from it, and commenting upon them as he proceeded, The committee had with regret been under the necessity of striking off votes to both par. ties, in every respect good, but that they had not been assessed to the laud tax. The outrages complained of by the right hon. gent. who opened the debate were unjustifiable, although some exertions had certainly been made by the sheriffs to suppress them. The learned counsel had insisted strongly on the propriety of the sheriffs being tried by the evidence which they had it in their power at the moment to benefit themselves by, and not by that afterwards collected for the Committee. He acknowledged the justness of this observation, and accordingly the committee in their report had withdrawn all that part of the evidence relating to the mill voters, which the sheriffs could not be in possession of at the time of the election. The committee were certainly of opinion, that by acting sometimes judicially and sometimes ministerially, the850sheriffs had become culpable. The principal point was certainly that of the mill voters, and to that point, to the question of possession, Mr. Mainwaring's enquiries' were chiefly directed on the 1:5th day of the election. He was convinced, that an undue bias had existed in the minds of the sheriffs, and that at different periods they had pursued different modes of conduct, as it suited their wishes. With regard to the excuse that had been attempted to be set up, of the embarrassments in which the sheriffs found themselves involved in their decisions, he confessed it appeared to him, that a very moderate understanding indeed would have extricated them.

He had listened with the utmost attention to the arguments of the learned gent. at the bar, but he owned that he remained entirely unconvinced by them. In considering the merits of the question, the acts of irregularity mentioned by his right hon. friend near him, ought not to be wholly omitted, as they tended distinctly to shew the motives by which the sheriffs had been actuated. The question was, whether or not the sheriffs, with an intention of giving sir F. Burdett an unfair majority, did wilfully and corruptly admit the mill-voters, knowing them at the same time to be bad, and on the 15 day of the poll, towards the close, when the majority turned in favour of sir Francis, rejected votes exactly similar to those they had before accepted. Examine them by their own evidence. They had laid down two rules for their conduct; one, how to acquire information, the other, how to act on such information when acquired. The hon. and learned gent. proved, by an examination of the circumsances of the case, that they either departed from, these rules, or adhered to them as inconvenience dictated. After exposing the' impossibility that the sheriffs should be ignorant of the absurdity of the claims set up by the Isleworth mill-holders to aright of voting, from their possession of a freehold, be commented severely on their conduct with regard to Albion Copper.851Satisfied as they must have been, that this man had no right whatever to give his vote on the election, they allowed him to be sent to his oath, that is, to go to certain perjury. The sheriffs had decreed, among their regulations, that no inspector should put a question to a voter but through the medium of a poll clerk; but the right of pulling questions in this way was never questioned until the 14th day of the poll, when Mr. Silvester objected to the first set of mill voters that were brought up, on the ground of joint tenantry, and shortness of possession. On an absurd pretence that the question should not be asked on the hustings, but in the box, they prevented him from making the necessary inquiries, and on his requesting Mr. Mainwaring to do so, sheriff Rawlins in a very rude way, and which was still more reprehensible when Mr. Mainwaring's age wu6 considered, shoved him from the hustings. It should be the object of the returning officer, at every election, to ascertain the truth, if possible; but here the endeavours of the sheriffs were evidently directed to smother it, and they strictly forbade the voters to answer any question, lest they should betray themselves. Nor did these facts depend solely upon the evidence of Mr. Silvester, it was corroborated by that of Mr. Smith, who confirmed it indeed in every particular. The hon. learned gent. entered into a strict investigation of the circumstances attending the last day of the poll, and contended, in opposition to the learned gent. who had been heard at the bar, and who wished to prove, that the conduct of the sheriffs on that day was favourable to Mr. Mainwaring, that their conduct was directly the reverse. On that day all the old whigs, as they were called, voted for sir Burdett. About the middle of the day, when according to the evidence of Mr. Clifford himself, who was sir F. B 's counsel, the election was a hollow thing in his favor; objections were listened to by the sheriffs against a body of mill voters, and for this proceeding they qlaim the praise of candour and impartiality, when in fact, the election being secure, they began to think they had carried the matter top far by the unquestioned admission of these voters, and wished to retrieve their character by an affected severity.

He confessed, he did hope that the second reading of the bill would have been deferred until gentlemen should have had lime fully to consider the report of the salt committee of a former session, which the house had, on a late day, ordered to be printed. The labours of that committee were valuable; and he hoped that the members who composed it would that night follow up the wise, humane, and patriotic resolutions, by opposing the present tax. By the report, it was obvious that the committee under the last administration purposed, by their report, to lead to the abolition of the tax on salt altogether. Salt was an article important to all descriptions, and as it was used by all for the most beneficial purposes, he trusted all descriptions of persons, in that house, would oppose the tax now sought to be laid on it. It would be recollected, that bread was a principal article of sustenance used by persons of all descriptions throughout the kingdom: now, by this tax it was unavoidable, that the price of bread should be raised; in fact, bread had been already risen an assize by the mere report of such a proposition. There was a petition, at that moment, before the house, from the baker's company, praying for relief, in consequence of various alterations in the, sources of their profits, and in particular because of this tax. Throughout the country the effect must unavoidably be the same. It would affect the price of salt used in all kinds of salt meat, so as to place them above the reach of the poor. Salt-fish was an extensive article of sustenance in many of the labouring parts of the kingdom; this would experience a rise of price amounting to little short of prohibition. The tax would entirely alter the condition of the lower orders. It would render them totally dependant on the affluent for support. It would prevent them from maintaining that state of independence which697was their birth-right, and which it was peculiarly the business and duty of that house to preserve to them in all its integrity.

The right hon. gent. had asked why, if the suggestions of the committee on the salt duties were politic and expedient, they were not acted upon during the existence of peace? To this the answer was at once simple and conclusive. The house would recollect that the report was made in 1801, and it was only in that one session that the interval of peace gave any opportunity for bringing forward a proposition for the repeal of the salt duties. At that time those at the head of affairs, and those who brought forward the report, had hot time to make up their minds how far a bill for the repeal of the duties was expedient, or in what manner the deficiency arising to699the revenue should be supplied. But it was, indeed, a very different thing to talk of the absolute repeal of a tax allowed to be obnoxious, and to come forward with a proposition for augmenting it to a monstrous extent. Whenever this country was restored to peace, he hoped and trusted that the tax would be totally annihilated, But, said the right hon. gent, if the old tax cannot now be renewed, on what principle was it that gentlemen objected to the increase? This, truly, was a very singular and novel sort of reasoning. He would ask the right hon. gent, if the tax amounted only to two hundred thousand pounds he would object to the repeal? He believed the right hon. gent, could then have no doubt as to the policy of the repeal. The old tax amounted to a million, hence arose the difficulty of destroying so large an amount of revenue. But the new tax proposed to render this revenue greater by five hundred thousand pounds, and hence the difficulty of the repeal was greatly enhanced. On this ground, if he had no others, he should therefore object to the fresh imposition. It was not only oppressive now that war existed, but would infallibly throw fresh obstacles in the way of the repeal, whenever peace came to be restored. Now, as to the tax itself, he further objected to it, that it attached to one of the direct necessaries of life. With respect to many articles of consumption to which taxes applied, the lower orders had a remedy, either by discontinuing them altogether, or by using them in a more sparing manner. But here the evil could not by any means be avoided. The right hon. gent, had said, that the fisheries would not be affected in consequence of the drawback to be afforded. The very necessity of the drawback was, however, an argument against the tax. Difficulties srpse out of drawbacks in two ways. In the one case, the revenue was defrauded, pr in the other, the individual would not derive the advantages intended by the legislature. He could suppose the case of a poor man who cured a small quantity of fish chiefly for his own use; but perhaps, partly for a retail trader. Now, in this case, it was next to an impossibility to make the distinction betwixt the salt used for this trade, and that employed for his own use. As to the tax generally, he condemned it in its application to the poor, as countrary to every principle, on which taxation had hitherto been founded. It had always been hitherto acted on as a general700principle, that wheat, corn, and butcher's meat, should not be directly taxed. Here, however, butcher's meat was indirectly taxed, and that sort of food which the lower orders principally depended on for their subsistence. The right hon. gent, had argued that the tax would fall lightly on the poorer classes; but how did this appear, when it was to attach chiefly to salt provisions, which, with the exception of bread and potatoes, where salt too was indispensable, constituted the sole support of the laborious orders? He did not pretend himself to have much information on this subject, but he had felt it his duty to inquire into the business, and he found, that if twenty score were to be salted, it would require no less than a bushel and a half of salt. It was true that a hog of this size was not likely to be in the hands of a person in the lower orders of life. But this, so far from weakening, strongly corroborated his argument. It was well enough known, that if a bog of a smaller size was to be salted, a greater quantity, of salt in proportion would be required. Supposing then that a small hog was to be salted, and a quantity of salt, which now paid a duty of 14s. was required, the same quantity would cost 20s. for though the tax was only 5 shillings, yet the retail dealer would certainly raise it to six, if not to a still higher price. He wished gentlemen to bear in mind, whether this addition would not, to a poor cottager, prove a very serious addition. Now, as to the effect of the tax, so far as respected our agriculture, he had consulted many of the best judges in the kingdom, and they were all of one opinion, that the total repeal of the salt duties would be one of the most important measures which could be adopted. They all allowed, that if salt free of duty could be employed on a large scale, it would be productive of incalculable benefit. It behoved gentlemen then well to weigh this before they consented, to a fresh, imposition, by which the use of salt in agriculture would be in a great measure prohibited. Here the same arguments as applied to the fisheries could not be employed, because a drawback could by no possibility be employed.

He had no doubt that if the war had not broken out, the suggestions of the committee on the salt duties would have been carried into effect.

The argument of the right hon. gent, opposite, that the tax would not be oppressive, because it would only make an addition of 4 or 5 shillings to each family, was totally unfounded. The fact was, it would create an addition to this amount in every individual of a family, and would any one deny that this would be a most heavy and serious pressure? Hitherto it had been the object of the house to exempt from taxation all articles of indispensable necessity to the sustenance of life. Other articles of convenience or luxury might be given up, but here, it was proposed to lay a very severe impost on an article admitted on all hands to be an article of primary necessity, and one which was essential not to the comfort only, but the very existence of the lower orders. Salt was like leather, and candles, and a few other articles, which only deserved the name of necessaries in the strictest sense of the term. The house were aware that a tax on such articles was attended with inconveniences far greater than the bare amount of the impost in the first instance. The moment the tax was promulgated the, retail dealer took advantage of raising the article taxed to a vast tax for the consumer. This rise was in all cases exceedingly oppressive to the702labouring classes of the community. He referred the house to what had been found to be the effect of the salt tax in France. There it was found to be a most odious, oppressive impost, and more than almost any other cause excited disgust against the government. There too the rise of the price counteracted the views of those who projected and persevered in the tax. The people in most cases diminished the consumption, and in others totally disused it. It was a fact that, when the price was comparatively small, there were twenty-eight pounds consumed, while in the same family there was not a consumption of twelve pounds when the price became exorbitant. The hon. baronet desired the house to look to the state of the northern counties, and the sort of bread which constituted the principle food of the laborious classes. Salt was indispensable to the formation of this bread, and surely it was the height of impolicy to augment burdens among those who were the least able to afford them. He should ever set his face against taxes affecting, as this did, the middling, and he would contend, the most valuable part of society. If such taxes were accumulated, it was easy to foresee the consequences. We could not raise the public burdens. We must come to a stand.

The noble earl called to the recollection of the house the circumstance of the disturbances which took place in the county of Devon, in the spring of the year 1801; about which time, a species of mutiny existed in certain of his majesty's dock-yards. To these his attention had been called in his official capacity of lord lieutenant of that county; the then high prices of corn and other articles of provision were held out as the pretext, and, perhaps, might, in some degree, be the cause. In the course of the disturbances, several acts of violence took place, and it shortly appeared that the parties were actuated by motives distinct from those which had been held out as the pretexts. The contagion was spread to the dock-yards, where it operated in a manner the most dangerous. In its progress, plans of communication with the royal dock-yards in other quarters, and committees of correspondence were established, for the purpose of enforcing the claims of the refractory artificers, He had done whatever lay in his power to satisfy those persons, and to allay the dis-716turbances; it was, however, at the same time, obviously proper to proceed with the utmost caution, and under the circumstances of the case, he had deemed it expedient to communicate to his majesty's ministers what observations he had made, and the impression left upon his mind. The communication was officially made in the first instance to a noble duke, then at the head of the home department. It was the wish of the government to avail itself of his local Knowledge upon the occasion; he accordingly gave every information upon the subject in his power. It was not his intention then to take up their lordships' time, neither did he think it would be regular to enter into any details of the transactions alluded to, or notices of the correspondence; at length he received notice from a noble earl, now in his place, and then at the head of the board of admiralty, that a commission had been appointed to enquire into the proceedings in question; and thoroughly investigating the circumstances of the case; the result of these enquiries was, as he understood, the dismissal from his majesty's dock-yards of more than one hundred persons. He had left all his documents upon the subject in the country, not imagining the subject would ever again be revived. He therefore could not speak precisely, but the number he believed was from one hundred to an hundred and twenty; these men were discharged, and the measure was followed up by sending the names of the culprits to all the other king's, and even to the merchants' dock-yards, in order, as he should imagine, that they should not be received or employed in them. But he afterwards learned, and he had no reason to doubt the truth of his information, that several of the dismissed artificers had been received into his majesty's dock-yards. He must take it for granted, that the dismissal proceeded upon strong and cogent grounds, with out which, a step, which might otherwise appear tinctured with cruelty and inhumanity, would not, he believed, be taken. He did not mean to propose any specific proceeding as to the affair in question; but he held it as a part of his public duty, to call the attention of parliament to the fact he had adverted to. He was the farther induced to this, when he recollected the confidence reposed in him on the occasion; by the noble earl then at the head of the admiralty, even under his own responsibility. He repeated717his opinion, that neither the noble earl, nor any of those respectable persons, who constituted the board, over which he presided would deprive the individuals in question of their situations, without strong and adequate grounds. He was persuaded it had been the result of diligent investigation and a conviction, that the continuance of such persons in their situations was, so far, incompatible with the public safety. Under these impressions, he had called their lordships' attention to the circumstance, and should beg leave simply to move, 1st. That a list of the names of such artificers as were discharged by the commissioners of naval enquiry in April 1801, in consequence of a mutiny then existing, be laid before the house. And 2dly. A list of the names of such artificers as may have entered into his majesty's dock-yards, as they have respectively reentered.\"", "author_id": "/people/mr-hugh-fortescue", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},

He rather thought the committees should be instructed to withhold all reports until the whole of the charges against the accused should be gone through.

He thought the duty imposed upon the committee, in the present instance, was similar to that which grand juries of the country had to fulfil. In considering the question then before the house, the situation of the accused, one of a very serious nature ought to be considered; the possibility of his being brought to the bar upon any one or two of the charges, while the rest may be pending or undecided, the situation of the accused person's mind, on such an occasion, was worthy of consideration. Added to this, was that of the contingency of his being voted guiltless of the particular charges reported to the house, and no opinion being subsequently stated, or decision made as to the remaining charges; a contingency, which, he thought, in point of fairness to the individual, as well as in justice to the public at large, ought to be seriously considered, and, in his opinion, was worthy of being made the subject of a specific motion.", "author_id": "/people/mr-frederick-howard-1", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},

Those grounds were such as he had very little doubt would convince the majority of the house of the propriety of adopting the amendments he proposed. He had, indeed, never heard any serious objection urged against them. It therefore struck him as rather extraordinary, after the declared coincidence of the right hon. gent, to be told that some military officers entertained doubts upon the subject. No doubt was expressed by any person of that house; not a sentence of objection was heard from any member; and yet those salutary improvements, for the adoption of which policy, humanity, and justice equally called, were to be rejected or delayed, because some military officers doubted. How, he would ask, were the objections of such military persons to be brought before the house in a parliamentary form? and the mere statement of their objections, unaccompanied by any reason for such objections, was not, he contended, a parliamentary ground for the delay on the promotion of any measure.

This reduction took place in consequence of a consideration of the peculiar circumstances of the people of that country.

Considering, indeed, the situation of Scotland fully and fairly, it was his opinion that it. would be much wiser to remit the salt duty in that country altogether. That duty produced but 47,0001. per annum, and there was a bounty allowed from the excise amounting to 29,000l. which, with a considerable; bounty from the customs, exceeded the produce of the tax.

{"date": ["1805", "mar", "06"], "content": "rose, and spoke nearly to the following effect:&#x2014;I rise, sir, in pursuance of the notice I gave, on a former day, to submit to the house a motion for the repeal of a bill, passed last session of parliament, intituled, \"an act for the additional defence of the kingdom, &c.;\" I choose to give the whole of the title of this bill, rather than to be studious of brevity, though it might certainly give me an opportunity of complimenting the feelings of the right hon. gent. by describing it in its usual appellation, as Mr. Pitt's parish defence bill. When I gave my notice of this motion, I could not help observing, that it appeared to excite some surprise on the part of some gentlemen opposite; a surprise not unmixed with marks of disapprobation of a nature not the most orderly. I have been endeavouring to account for these symptoms of surprise and disapprobation. Did the hon. gentlemen724conceive that my notice arose merely from the thought of the moment; from being piqued at the right hon. gent's silence; from the loss of a debate on the occasion of the motion of my right hon. friend on this side of the house (Mr. Windham)? Did they imagine that we considered the speech of my right hon. friend, al speech in which so full, so able, and so luminous a view of the subject was taken, was so feebly sustained, and so ably and completely answered by a right hon. friend of mine on the opposite bench (Mr. Canning), that we wished for a little time to rally and get breath before we renewed the attack? Or did those hon. gentlemen conceive it to be extremely disrespectful to the right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer, who appeared to be so reluctant and so bashful when an attempt was made to bring him to take a part in a discussion, that I should strive to force him into another opportunity of a similar kind? I do pot doubt, sir, that it must have been most unpleasant to those gentlemen to have seen their right hon. friend wincing and writhing under the masterly and unanswerable speech of my right hon. friend. Yet, though they may think it uncourteous in us to force him to an explanation, we prefer adopting that course which we think right, without regarding the feelings of the right hon. gent. It may perhaps be considered superfluous to add any thing upon a subject which has been so ably handled by my right hon. friend. That nothing more can be said upon it than he has said I am perfectly aware. I do confess that the whole I have to say has been anticipated by him. The whole of the details were gone through by him in so masterly a manner, that but little more can be added. But if, in the course of that speech of my right hon. friend, which invited the house to a general review of the military state of the country, he clearly shewed that this statute, on which it was founded, was a scandalous statute, and a disgrace to your statute book, it was natural that some person should move to repeal it. If the causes to which I have referred were not the inducements to that surprise and disapprobation which were exhibited on a former, day, I can suggest but one more cause. Perhaps it excited some degree of surprise, that I should be the person to move for the repeal of an act that professed to have been passed for the defence of the country. It has been very much the fashion to say,725when you oppose any of the measures of government, that you are damping the spirit of the country, that you are holding out hopes and allurements to the enemy. Sir, if I thought that, in any one instance, the motion I have to submit could in the smallest degree distress the country; that it could in any view discourage the heart, and feelings, and energy of those who defend the country; that it could throw the slightest ignominy or slur on those whose duty it is to collect the materials for the defence of the country, I would be one of the last men in the world to bring forward such a motion. How my motion will be treated. I am wholly at a loss to conjecture. The right hon. gent. opposite me thought fit on a former night to preserve a regular, persevering, and dignified silence. The duty of answering the right hon. mover was performed by a right hon. friend, (Mr. Canning) for whom I really entertain a very great respect. I speak seriously. I am to conclude that he was very well contented with his own speech. If he was contented with it, all I can say is, that he is a gentleman who is very easily contented. Certainly, out of doors, it has been said that the speech of my right hon. friend was a complete answer to the motion; but, whatever may have been said or thought out of doors, I am sure it was not thought so by any one member within doors, and least of all by my right hon. friend himself. I profess the highest admiration of his talents, but I declare I never saw him so labour and flounder upon any subject before. He seemed to be struggling against wind and tide, clapping up a bit of sail to catch every little puff of applause from behind him; and sometimes compelled to take to his sweeps. He was obliged to make his speech noisy, because he knew he could not make it convincing, and he uniformly raised his voice in proportion as he dropped his argument; No man, I am sure, felt the disadvantage of the cause he was labouring more than he did himself: It was a speech of the Catamaran species, plenty of noise and little mischief; I mean mischief to those it was intended to annoy, but what damage it may have done to those it was intended to support, is more than I can pretend to say.&#x2014;Having endeavoured so far to stand' right with the house in the view I have taken of the state of the last debate, am I to be considered presumptous in following Up the motion726of my right hon. friend, by another motion to repeal the defence act, in which it is my intention chiefly to confine myself to the military part of it, and to the object I wish to press upon the house, of shewing the inefficiency of the measure, and the absolute necessity of repealing it altogether. If any persons expect any sport or diversion from any difference of sentiment or contradiction between me and other gentlemen who may side with me to-night, they will, I believe, be disappointed. In truth, the difference between me and those gentlemen is by no means so wide as has been represented on this subject. Where I differ from them, I am, not disposed to conceal my opinions; I shall ever be ready to state them openly and frankly. I have thought, and I do still think, most highly of the institution of the volunteer system. I think that system has been most useful and admirable. I am convinced, from authorities which I cannot for a moment dispute, that it has had a very powerful effect on the minds of our avowed and inveterate enemy. I believe that its success in this country struck a considerable panic into the mind of our enemy. What the conviction of the new emperor of France, what the opinion of Bonaparte may be, I cannot exactly tell, but I am sure it must have had some effect upon him. I am convinced that nothing more strongly impressed his minister for foreign affairs, Talleyrand, and the people of any consideration in general in France, than that this banking, luxurious, mercantile people, were not contented with lolling on the couch of indolence, and trusting to others to fight their battles; that they were not contented with putting their hands in their pockets, in order to raise an army of mercenaries to protect them, but that they trusted to themselves, and their own energy and spirit; that whether they had skill or not, they had the courage and the disposition to defend the country. If you call on government to have an army, be it of what amount it may, your enemy knows its full extent, and the means of meeting that army may be matte the subject of calculation; but when a nation has shewn such a spirit as this has, no enemy can calculate what it may produce. No one can say where the exertions of a nation will stop, when roused into action by an honourable determination and will to defend to the last every thing that is dear and valu727able.&#x2014;While, sir, I thus admire the noble institution of the volunteer system, I must also own that I am not a friend to any very material diminution of the militia force. I am sure that the principle of that force is a sound one, and I know that it is popular among all ranks. It is one to which the opinions, and feelings, and habits of the people, have been long accustomed, I do not see that there is any very serious evil in having a force consisting of some variety of descriptions. I must own that I dislike putting our trust altogether in an army raised on the principle of hire. No country of which history speaks has ever maintained long her honour, her prosperity, and her liberty, by trusting merely to an army consisting wholly of hired soldiers.&#x2014;Still, however, I expect to be told, Chat by bringing forward such a motion as this, I am degrading the country. But I say, I am only shewing the failure of a boasted experiment. I say, it has completely failed. What was the promise of the right hon. gent.? 'What my predecessors could not do, I will perform. They were unworthy of being trusted. Give me your perfect confidence.' They must be hurled from their places as persons of imbecility and total inability, though they had seen in their time some accession to the national force. They saw almost a million and a half of men in arms, they saw the country half-martial throughout its population; yet so wretched and imbecile and insignificant were they, that they could not, in the estimation of the right hon gent, go on any longer. 'Let me come,' says the right hon. gent. 'Clear away all the rubbish. I will come, and set every thing to rights.' Well, sir, I comes: and when I comes, what does I do? Why I does nothing half so good, nor half so vigorous, as the much-abused and stupid ministers that were turned out to make way for him. Why, now sir, I wish to expose to the country the nature of the imposture. Has not the country been imposed upon? Is not the effect of this defence bill a proof of the imposition practised upon it? Are these new ministers worthy of the places they have contrived to push themselves into by the changes that have been made? But then they all cry out, 'O! it is dangerous and shocking to tell the country that, the bill has failed! It may damp public spirit and depress the national energies. Let us conceal it, let us keep it quiet, let us keep it snug amongst ourselves!' To say that they who dispossessed another728set of ministers of their places for alledged incapacity, and brought in a bill on which to found their claims to pre-eminence, had found their bill ineffectual, and even worse on the. comparison; to say that the great man's measure has failed, and that a bill to raise men has been converted into a mere bill to raise money by the most objectionable means, has been converted into a most odious tax bill; why that, it seems, would be to dispirit and destroy the patriotism and energy of the nation, it would ruin the necessary confidence in the government of the country. The country has often heard of flourishing statements of the numbers of the regular army to a great amount, though it has turned out to be only a statement on paper; but the delusion in the present instance will not do. Any, attempt to make it succeed, must be as absurd and stupid as the bill itself. It is not a measure in which the people are only to judge of a matter in which they are not the actors. No, sir, all the people know what is going on; they are behind, the scenes; they are under the apron of this famous puppet-shew. Every one of them has something to do in the business. They have to pull the wires and the strings of the machine. You won't make them believe they have raised men, when they know they have raised none. There seems to be three simple points on which this question turns. First, has this bill failed or not? Secondly, if it has failed, is it likely, by continuing in operation, to atone for its failure by future success? And, thirdly, is the experiment itself mischievous and dangerous? Here the house will not fail to recollect, that this was a measure recommended to us, not as a flow and progressively operating scheme, which, in process of time, should improve the military force of the country, and perfect the means of-raising a regular army. No, sir, it was a scheme pressed upon the house, at a time when its great author spoke of nothing but of counting, not months and weeks, but days and hours, whenever the necessities and the dangers of the country were to be considered. It was a plan by which a quick and unprecedented addition of force was to be made far army, far exceeding any thing that our the silly, weak administration were capable of effecting. It was to give us, and to give at speedily, the means; of resisting, all foreign efforts, and of enabling us to repel that torrent of liquid fire about to be729poured out on this nation, and to retort upon the proud and daring invader, all the horrors with which, in the intoxication of his insolence, he had dared to menace us.&#x2014;It has been said by some persons, that my right hon. friend, who introduced this subject this session, treated it with considerable levity, and that from the abundance of his merriment, it is not possible to believe that he was really serious in his representation of the very deficient state of the military measures pursued by the present ministers. There are Some things, sir, that are of such a description as must infallibly awaken the sense of ridicule; 'Ridiculum acri quid vetat.' When, after being listened to attentively, and the means afforded him unsparingly, the boaster fails egregiously in every one of his grand and vaunted projects, the sense of ridicule is irresistibly excited. What did he promise? Was it a mere measure of finance? No such thing! It was a measure for the raising of men for military service. The only hope of service that any man can expect from the bill, is quite different from the object held out to the house and the country at the introduction and passing of it. If you were to contract for a certain number of excellent horses to mount a corps of light artillery upon, and your contractor brought, instead of them, an equal number of stout, orderly, well-behaved oxen, could you mount your light artillery upon them, or would you think he had performed his promise, and complied with the terms or the spirit of his contract? In order to try whether the right hon. gent. has failed or not in his lofty and extensive promises to the house, it is necessary to touch but lightly on mere matters of figures, Since the particulars have been already so ably detailed to you, and commented upon. On this point your attention ought to be directed to the general statements of your military force. And here it strikes one, at the very outset, that it is asserted by some gentlemen, that even a failure on the part of the present administration in their performances, is very different from a failure on the part of the late ministers. It is nothing like so bad and so dangerous, because, say they, our force is upon the whole so considerably increased; and the right hon. gent, himself seemed, when the subject was first mentioned, to pant after the time when he might have the opportunity of shewing it. My right hon. friend730opposite (Mr. Canning) says, that our navy has been augmented by the number of no less than 50 ships of war. Sir, I deny it. We have not one more effective ship of war, nor an atom more of actual efficient naval force, than we had under the last naval administration. But it would appear that there is something so very peculiar in the composition of the present administration, as to challenge and to command such an especial and unbounded degree of confidence, that no man shall presume to say that any thing in the shape of enquiry is at all necessary. On the subject of their superior claims to the confidence of this house and the public, I shall say a little more by and bye. I must, however observe, that the change, as it respects a claim for confidence, has, indeed, altered circumstances, but has altered them very much for the worse. I shall now shew from a short review of the returns on the table, what the exertions of the right hon. gent. have produced for the army, and how the country has reason to feel from the change which placed the right hon. gent. in power.In Jan. 1804 the whole of our army amounted to191,099In Jan. 1805 the whole of our army amounted to143,651Deficiency41,448In Jan. 1804 the Militia109,947In Jan. 1805 the Militia85,519Deficiency24,428Total of army and militia in Jan. 1804301,046Total of army and militia in Jan. 1805229,170Deficiency71,876The Cavalry in Jan. 180411,177The Cavalry in Jan. 180521,223Increase4,046The Artillery in Jan. 18047,661The Artillery in Jan. 18058,517Increase856The Foreign Troops in 180413,710The Foreign Troops in 180521,028Increase7,318From the documents altogether, there results an augmentation of the whole body of the army of only 11,000 men, making the whole difference between the returns of force of the two years, and consequently the sum of the efforts of the present administration. But you are to consider, that of the increase, 7000 men are in the731foreign corps, and 4000 in the cavalry. We find, however, that in the British infantry, there is a deficiency of 856 men. Surely the Ceylon, troops are not in fairness to be reckoned. Indeed, augmentation in that quarter cannot justly be taken into the account for ministers, since, with the increase of distant territories, it becomes a matter of necessity to increase the troops. To call this an actual extension of your disposable force, is a downright fallacy. But what we do find, sir, is this; that there is a positive decrease in that particular branch of the military force, which it was the peculiar and boasted object of this bill to increase. To what was this bill particularly to apply? Was it to the raising of troops at Ceylon? Was it to Black Corps? Was it to an addition of German Legions? No! it was to augment greatly the numbers of the British infantry. Has it done so? Has it produced the promised and desired augmentation? No! And if there be any increase upon the whole, it is not the right hon. gent but it is his predecessor, who has the right to claim the merit. It is he who was at the head of that \"wretched, incapable, nauseous, milk-and-water administration,\" with whose laurels the right hon. gent, attempts to adorn himself. I must therefore say, that gentlemen should be inclined to retract those severe and taunting expressions against the late administration, on a comparison of their merits with those of the present ministers. I know it was said, that let those ministers go when they would, worse could not follow. Some others, as well as myself, were of a different opinion. We thought that worse could follow, and we think now that worse have followed them. We may now presume to think, that we were then in the right. We said, infinitely worse may succeed them, who will perform their promises much worse, And keep far less good faith with this house and with the country. By what means have they raised the increase of 4000 horse, but by the raising of men for rank? Did the present ministers introduce that? No! And the same remark holds good as to the foreign corps. Whatever merit, therefore, is ascribable to any person for the augmentation of our military force, is not at all owing to the right hon. gent. or his boasted bill, but it is owing to the noble lord now at the head of his majesty's councils. Perhaps I have made a mistake. I mean the noble lord, now president of the732council. I don't know whether he is at the head of his majesty's councils or not; that might be a mistake; I don't enquire into that matter. It is not now of material consequence, whether he is so, or is not. But I do say, that if any thing has been done to enable the right hon. gent. to make any grand exploit, any attack on the enemy's possessions, the merit is not due to him, but to lord Sidmouth.&#x2014;Whatever returns may appear from the right hon. gent's. own bill, they can have no effect. But it is most ludicrously clear that his bill has failed, completely failed! And sir, what does appear? Why, it appears that the 52 counties of England and Wales have jointly, under the operation of this formidable additional force act, produced 1,295 men; that out of this number there have deserted, or have been discharged, 266 men, leaving 1,079 effective soldiers; and it further appears, that out of this number raised throughout all England, by the most extraordinary means; by all those grand efforts, of which we have heard so much; by local influence and attachments; by sympathetic feelings, and a thousand other operations, assisted and enforced by justices and churchwardens, and all descriptions of parish officers, I suppose not less than 40,000 men altogether, there have been procured no more than 342 men to enter for general service; that is to say, the right hon. gent. has, with all his machinery, been enabled to raise after the rate of four men and a quarter for each county in England&#x0153; In Scotland, it seems, 267 men have been procured, out of which 43 have gone for general service. In Ireland, where the parish officers alone have done this business, they have got 1081; but there, sir, the zeal has stopped. I do not find that one of these has entered for general service. It does appear, from a particular examination of the whole matter, upon abundant proof, that the parish officers are much worse agents, with all the local and sympathetic engines, for raising men for the army, than the regimental recruiters. It appears that they have not been so solicitous to give the king a good soldier, as they have been to get rid of a vagrant. Hence, in Lancashire there have been 255 deficient by desertion or otherwise. Where the right hon. gentleman's own influence was particularly directed, 11 men were procured, all of whom deserted, and in that particular district where his733own authority and popularity are so abounded, where all the people admire him as a general, as much as they venerate him as a politician and a statesman, I mean the Cinque-ports, the spot of his own residence, he has contrived so far to stimulate martial policy as to have been able to raise one man! ac ille leo est! I wish we could get a look at this extraordinary man. He must be a very Hercules. He is an extraordinary recruit indeed! This reminds me of the story of lord Donegal's troop of light horse. When a certain general asked where lord Donegal's troop of light horse were, a man rode up, and said, 'I am lord Donegal's troop.' So, if you ask where the parish volunteers are, out steps a man from the Cinque ports, and says, ',Here I am.' Really, sir, if ever there was a bill introduced into parliament which was calculated to bring to disgrace its author, it is this miserable measure. However we may differ in subdivisions here, we can have but one heart and one mind in defending the country; but to pause about continuing this bill is what I cannot account for; it is a cheat, an imposition. You come into a parish and you say, 'Give me a soldier.' The parish officer says, 'I can't; I have not got one.' You then turn round, like an impudent bully, and tell him, 'Very well, then, if you don't put twenty pounds in a certain place, I shall find a way of making you.' To those who complain so much of the parish officers not having done their duty under this bill, I would ask why the privy council did not set them a good example, by doing their duty? Had the privy council done so, the proclamation of lord Hawkesbury would not have been delayed so long. From this instance of neglect in the privy council I should think it would, be necessary in any future acts, where that council should have any duty to execute, that a clause should be inserted to inflict a penalty upon them for neglect. As to the double penalty threatened on the parishes which are deficient under this act, I think the collection of it would not be less difficult than oppressive.&#x2014;But now it is said, you have not given the bill a fair chance&#x2014;give it a full trial&#x2014;wait a moment. I say we have waited long enough. It was a bill which professed to raise expeditiously a great force. Has it done so? No&#x2014;the time is over; then why give it a: longer trial? To elucidate this by a comparison. We have heard a734good deal respecting the different modes of conveying men by land carriage. Suppose a schemer was to say, \"all these plans are good for nothing; they will not answer; you cannot depend upon them. Look at my plan; I will convey you 20 men to Windsor and back again in six hours.\" Suppose any of us were to be so foolish as to listen to this schemer, and to destroy all our old machines, expecting he would perform his promise. \"Well,\" says the projector, \"now get in twenty of your infantry, knapsacks, baggage, arms, accoutrements and all, I'll bring you back in six hours, depend upon it.\" We believe him, and after waiting six hours we hear he is at Kensington. That's something&#x2014;we suppose he is coining back with the troops&#x2014;no such thing&#x2014;we find that he has got no further&#x2014;in fact, that he has not travelled more than half a mile an hour. Why, what should we think if he was to say&#x2014;\"O, but you must give me time, I have not had a fair trial?\" Or suppose a man, seeing me using a blunderbuss, was to say to me&#x2014;\"Take away that clumsy gun, you shall try mine with a fine hair trigger \"&#x2014;I receive it from him&#x2014;it misses fire&#x2014;\"Never mind,\" says the man, \"give it time, keep it to your shoulder, it only hangs iire.\"&#x2014;\"I do keep it to my shoulder, but still it wont go off.\" If it hung fire only for a moment or two, it might not signify much, but I should think I had been grossly imposed upon, if I had been persuaded to change my blunderbuss for a gun with a hair trigger that hung fire for six months. Really, sir, the mode of proceeding adopted by gentlemen opposite, upon this bill, is something like laughing at the house. They had better call it a tax bill at once, and defend it on that ground, though that was never professed to be its object. If it will not do for one thing, it may do for another. If it cannot attain its intended object, it will serve for a different one. It is giving us what does not answer the purpose it professed. It is like giving a man a sword and a shield, the former of which is unfit for offence, and the latter for defence, and then consoling him, by saying, \"Never mind, your sword will make an excellent soup ladle, and your shield an admirable fish kettle.\" Now, it is just the. same thing with the right hon. gent.'s bill. It won't answer for recruiting the British army, but it may be a notable finance measure. But pray do not venture to say, that for all its professed ends, it has not735totally failed. My right hon. friend opposite (Mr. Canning) thought we were in such a state as entitled us to overlook this failure; arid he wished us to see the increased state of our naval force. Now, I say, we have not added one man to the efficient force of the military department of our navy. I say, that in that point we are not equal to the state in which Earl St. Vincent, the late first lord of the Admiralty, left us. The force he left us, I assert, was superior to our present force, for the protection of our trade, and for the annoyance and chastisement of our enemies. If you examine impartially and carefully all this trash of 50 additional ships of war, you will find more than 30 of them old broken-down West-India vessels, and others of a similar description, bought in the river. One of them got to the Downs, but could not keep the sea any longer; another, a fifty-gun ship, an old West-Indian, was broken-backed in the river, and was reported in that state, but was purchased nevertheless, and others of them are still in the river. One went out neither fit to go to sea nor to ride at anchor. She went without her convoy, not because they could not keep up with her, but because she was quite unmanageable. It will also appear on inquiry that the present Admiralty board, has ordered the purchase of some West Indiamen in the river, which were reported to that board to be incapable of being made fit for use at the time of the purchase, and which were still lying in the river. Such are the ships of war which the present vigorous Admiralty have added to our fleet, and they have against that addition reduced it by dismantling 7 ships of the line and several frigates. By the bye, as a sample of the wisdom of building vessels of war in merchants dock yards, which the right hon. gent, once so strongly recommended, all those dismantled vessels had been so built, and not one of them had been in use above 7 years. The addition of men alleged to be made to the naval service, under the present Admiralty, does not exceed 5000. When you take the slight trouble of considering what was the great increase made by the noble earl during his administration of naval affairs, and compare it with what has been done since, after all the boast that was made, and all the charges you beard, the performances of the present administration sink to ridicule. Why does net the right hon. gent. put his assertions736to the test? Why does he not bring forward an examination of the conduct of the late board of admiralty? While he refuses to come to that test, bow unjustifiable is it in him, to state in this house, to the prejudice of that gallant veteran officer, that all he has heard, and all he has read, and all he has seen, have convinced hint of the justice and propriety of the accusations be made, when he arraigned in this house the conduct of the noble earl's naval administration? On this subject I do not wish to say any more at present. But I must observe, that if the evil hour should ever come when government shall find it necessary to call on that noble and gallant admiral again to hoist his flag, not more for the terror and dismay of our foes, than for the benefit of his example throughout the British navy, by his skill and valour, and his strict observance of that discipline which is so essentially necessary to the existence of our fleets, and of which he himself is so decided an instance in his own rigorous observance and his self-devotion to the service, they will be deeply and solemnly responsible for having sent out that naval hero with all the impressions they have made by endeavours to lower his character in the eyes of the navy, calumniated, and half disgraced, and disheartened (as far as they could), to the fleet, with the name of a harsh, a rigorous, and an oppressive tyrant.&#x2014;Having said so much as to the matter and the effects of this bill, I beg to say a word upon the bill itself. In looking over it, every clause seems to be drawn up with a characteristic degree of confidence. It states, first, that whereas it is necessary to raise 85,000 men; it proposes to raise that number within the year. On the next year it proposes to raise as many men as shall be necessary to supply the deficiencies occasioned in the additional force, &c.; by enlistments for general service. Afterwards, the bill becomes somewhat moderate, and promises to supply substitutes only for 9,000 men each year, which is the estimated amount of enlistment for general service, and the substitutes are not to exceed that number. But the most curious part of this curious bill is, that the parish officers are restrained from procuring men beyond a certain distance from their respective parishes, while the regular recruiting officer, who is to provide the men in case the parishes fail, is at liberty to procure those men wherever he can get them. Another sin-737gular thing in the act is, that it is not specified what bounty the parish officers shall be permitted to give, whether one pound or ten. This was left at the discretion of government, and therefore mi, misters may, if they please to render this tax productive, levy the penalties of 201. or 401, according to their pleasure. But it is impossible these penalties can ever be levied, for all the parishes in England are the delinquents. This defect in the bill I have just alluded to, was, I recollect, corrected in the bill for Ireland, for in that the bounty was limited to two thirds of the amount of the bounty settled for the regular army. Now, it is clear and manifest the house were told that it was a bill to raise men, yet it is calculated to raise a considerable sum of money. It is ridiculous to say that when you have levied the 20l. the bill will go to raise men. What do we know, or what do we care, whether it was to raise men or not, after the fines have been levied. The application of the money has nothing to do with the principle of the tax. You may apply the money to raise men, if you chuse, but that will not reconcile us to the tax, which is clearly a tax on the landed property of the country, and a most atrocious act of injustice.&#x2014;Sir, I have already observed, that in the opinion of some persons it seems as if there were something of a very peculiar nature in the present administration that gave them a title to an unbounded confidence from this house, and from the country, that no act of theirs should be marked with reprehension, and that we ought not to feel the same suspicions at the failure of their plans, as we ought to have done respecting the conduct and measures of the late silly, imbecile, insignificant ministers. Now, in what consists all this boasted improvement, and where are the merits of this great change? A change has been made, it is true. Many gentlemen expressed their desire, at this crisis of the affairs of the nation, to see an administration founded on a broad and comprehensive basis, combining all the great talents, genius, and experience, of the great public characters of this country. It was not only the wish of parliament, but it was, I believe, the wish, hope, and expectation of almost very man in the kingdom. I give to my right hon. friend opposite (Mr. Canning) full credit for his sincerity in the wishes he expressed for the promotion of this great738object. But if I do not give an equal degree of credit to the motives and conduct of others, it may be because I have not had the same opportunity of knowing how to estimate and approve their characters, habits, and principles. I believe he acted with sincerity, and felt his disappointment with regret. I suppose the right hon. gent. the present chancellor of the exchequer, found the administration too strong. That it was something like spirits above proof, which it was necessary to dilute, or like gold that was too pure for use; or, perhaps, he thought it too dazzling and brilliant, and that it was necessary to get back some of the mists and fogs of the last administration, in order to keep men's eyes from being dazzled with its prodigious glare. But does the right hon. gent. deceive himself by supposing that he came back to his office under the same, terms he quitted it? He went out, because there was a great question relative to Ireland, which he thought necessary to the salvation of that country. He went out because he could not carry that measure. He thought himself justified in saying, that there was but one person in the country who stood in the way of his wishes upon the subject. He advised the people of Ireland, after his retirement, not to form other views. He told them that they were to hail his return as the beacon which was to guide them to the object of their hopes. Is it not known that, he came back to his place without the slightest intention of performing his promise? Is it not known that he is allied in power with those who are pledged to resist the measure of Catholic emancipation? He came back with the character of having broken his faith with that laborious and respectable body of persons?&#x2014;But it is not merely with the loss of political integrity that he has come back to Office. Has he now the same character with the public which he once bad for political wisdom? What is the skill he has shewn in the first requisite of a great minister&#x2014;the knowledge of the character, talents, and dispositions of the men whom he is to appoint to fill the great situations in the civil departments, and those who are to be entrusted with the important charge of the defence of the country in the hour of danger? Whom has he now succeeded? Who gave his predecessors such high characters and such warm recommendations in this house? The noble lord (Hawkesbury) whom be panegyrized as the very739fittest person in the kingdom to direct the important department of Foreign Affairs, with the exception only of my honourable friend on my right hand (Mr. Fox), he has cashiered, and turned down to the home department. Why, if he understood his character and talents when he recommended him, does he degrade him now? The right hon. gent. seems to know no rule but his own will, and does not scruple to avow his. reduction of all the other members of the cabinet, to the situation of mere cyphers. Is it nothing that he should be so slow to discover the total inadequacy of the men he praises, for all the great purposes of the national defence, and the business of diplomacy? Is it nothing that he should be thus convicted of an utter incapacity to judge of the qualifications of such men? Your predecessor, sir, (lord Sidmouth) was, according to his account of him, the fittest person for the management of finance; and lord Hawkesbury and he had taken sweet counsel together, and he knew his abilities well. The right hon. gent. I assert, is convicted of an utter incapacity to form a proper judgment of public men. He cannot sit in a cabinet where they are to count noses, to use his own phrase: he must be sole master, and all the rest his mere slaves, or the tools of his power. In his former cabinet, there were men who had noses, and who were counted sometimes too. But, now, like the man mentioned in Tristram Shandy, there was only one nose as large as the steeple of Strasburg, which put all the rest out of countenance. It was the right hon. gent's early declaration, that he would never accept of any subordinate situation. Now, he will have no equality, he will have no man near him who shall have a voice of his own. Now that he comes back with a diminished character, he enlarges his claims beyond even all his former pretensions. The other, members of the cabinet are much the same as in the former \"silly, imbecile\" administration. There is my old friend, for whom I have a great respect, my lord Westmoreland, who is certainly neither wiser nor less wise than he was before. There is my lord Chatham, in whom there is no evident difference. The noble lord opposite (Castlereagh) came into the last administration an odd way, and continues in rather an odd way in the present. As for the lord Chancellor, the right hon. gent. does not appear to have found him out as yet. He has not yet disco-740vered that his lordship knows nothing about the laws of the country, though he was a member of the late administration. But my lord Hawkesbury is a rare example. When he was thought at one time the fittest man in the world but one to fill his department, why has the right hon. gent. forgotten to say any thing in favour of his successors, lord Harrowby and lord Mulgrave? For my lord Mulgrave, I have much personal respect; but what does the right hon. gent. say of his superiority over lord Hawkesbury, the fittest mail, save one, in the country? the noble lord, to be sure, has had experience in public affairs; he somehow or other got into Toulon; partly by some treachery among the inhabitants, who hesitated and differed about the mode of giving up the place; and perhaps it may be said he has managed very dextrously in getting into the place where he now is. Whether his lordship has the same opinion of it as he had of the other, and thinks himself, \"in a state of comfortable security,\" I do not pretend to know. But this I may say, without trespassing on the partiality of friendship, that as the right hon. gent. has not yet given the noble lord a high character in this house, as he never yet told us that he was the fittest person in the kingdom for his office, there seems to be something like a good chance of finding that he really is so. A noble duke without an office still remains. Formerly we used to have persons in the cabinet for business; now, it would appear, we had them for ornament. They may add something to the state of the business, like the pomp of led horses in an equipage. This noble duke (of Portland) appears ready to fill a place in any cabinet. No minister can be distressed for a person to fill up a vacancy in his cabinet, while this obliging personage is to be found, The right hon. gent. seems to follow the same principle in his cabinets as in his defence bill; but he succeeds in one, though he fails in the other. He can make no use of his reservoir for soldiers, but be has a perfect reservoir for ministers; he has only to turn the cock, and in they come.&#x2014;So far as I have gone, at least the comparison will not be denied to be rather in favour of the feeble administration of the right hon. gent.'s predecessor. But then, I am told, \"there's the first lord of the admiralty. Do you forget the leader of the grand catamaran expedition? Are you not aware of the important change in that department, and741the vast advantage the country is likely to derive from that change?\" Indeed, sir, it puzzles one to imagine, how the noble viscount (Melville) came to fill that office. There seemed tee be nothing in his particular habits that pointed it out to him, Am I asked whether I would have had that minister placed in his old situation? I say no! for Heaven's sake don't let him return to us as our War minister. When I recollect his management of expeditions; when I remember Toulon, and Corsica, and Ferrol, and, moreover, the expedition to Egypt, that expedition in which Providence so singularly blessed our arms an expedition, the scheme and means of which naturally led to any thing but the actual issue, I can never wish to see the noble viscount at the head of the war department again. I grant that it is fair to say, that a minister who has conducted land operations may possibly be equally capable of managing our naval concerns; but I cannot see the force, of that sort of logic which goes to prove, that because a man is totally ignorant of land operations, he is therefore skilled in those of the sea. This reminds me of an anecdote, which I shall relate with the greater satisfaction, because it will afford me an opportunity of introducing the name of a man, whose memory is dear to many of the members of this house; I mean the late Mr. Garrick. He had a friend, a Scotch gentleman, of the name of M'Crea. He was a very clever, agreeable man, but rather an eccentric character. He was so well beloved by all who knew him, that he was called \"honest Johnny M'Crea.\" This gentleman one day brought Garrick a tragedy in four acts. Garrick looked at it, and advised him to lay it aside, as be did hot appear to have a talent for writing tragedy. M'Crea took his advice, but the next year he went to him with a comedy in live acts, and desired it might be put in rehearsal. Garrick read it, and found it was execrable stud'; he returned it; upon which M'Crea asked him, how he could return it, as it had been written by his desire&#x2014;\"My desire,\" replied Garrick, \"I merely gave you my advice on the subject.\"&#x2014;\"What,\" said Johnny, \"did na ye tel me that my genius did nalee in the way o' tragedy?\"&#x2014;\"Yes,\" replied Garrick, \"but I did not, therefore, say that it lay in comedy.\"&#x2014;\"Bless my saul mon,\" cried Johnny, \"if my talent does na lee in the way o' tragedy, and it does na lee in the way o' comedy, whare the de'el else con it lee?\" Now, sir, it742does seem to me as if the noble viscount had been reasoning after the manner of honest Johnny M'Crea, and, because he has found out that his genius is not exactly fitted for laud operations, he takes it for granted that it must shine out in sea affairs, or \"whare the de'el else con it lee?\"&#x2014;In stating my objections to this bill, and enforcing the propriety repeal, I shall hear it said, to some others, have you got for it? But this answer would be very ill applied; for, as a bill for raising men, I say, that by getting rid of it, you can possibly lose nothing at all; as to a substitute for it, as a tax bill, I say, take any thing. I have already avowed, myself a friend ^to the old constitutional force of the militia; and I say now, that the high bounties of the militia do not arise out of that system itself. They arise out of the violation of faith with the militia. The principle of the militia originally was to engage country gentlemen to become officers, and to give little inconvenience to them in fact, to keep them in their own counties as much as possible. Something may have been gained by moving them about, in their discipline and precision, but there have been some disadvantages attending it. It is, sir, with great pride and satisfaction that I see in this country, noblemen and gentlemen leaving the hospitalities and splendour of their mansions to go out and discipline regiments of their countrymen in their service. But when I see faith broken with them, what am I to expect? You put them into a situation in which they cannot refuse to act contrary to their own wishes and intentions. Faith must be whole and unbroken, or it is nothing; a breach of it in the slightest degree, is like a flaw in an indictment, and destroys the whole. Faith is a mirror, in which the slightest fracture destroys tb.6 perfection, and you may as well shatter it at once to pieces. When militiamen are intoxicated, and means are used to tempt them, and they snap their fingers in their officers' faces, what an effect must it have; and how can you ever expect low bounties again? How differently used to be the inducement to the service! But now men are almost certain of being tempted or entrapped into service for Holland, or Egypt, or some other foreign destination, you create the cause of these high bouutks.&#x2014;One word on the subject of recruiting for rank. I confess I have not such strong743objections to this practice as some gentlemen entertain. When the country is pressed for men you may surely avail yourselves of this mode, especially in certain circumstances, such as formerly among the clans in Scotland, and even in some parts of Ireland. You may get men in this way more speedily than in any other in. some places, I cannot think that the body of the army can suffer much, by a few men of title and rank coming into it, and getting up rather hastily. It is better for the country that men pf property, rank, and title, should be in the army, and it is much less likely to excite any jealousy. I must trespass a short time longer on the subject of recruiting for a limited time. When the universal opinion of the thinking part of the public, and of military men, is expressed in its favour, when we can do it as soon as we can say it, when there can be. no doubt that his majesty would listen to it, when we find that the minister's own plan has totally failed, why should we not attempt it? I will not dwell further on the many reasons for it that have been so ably argued before. But I dislike much the. taking of poor ignorant boys, and fixing them in the army for their whole lives. A great lawyer has considered even the necessary mutiny act as an anomaly in the law and constitution of the country. Why should such anomalies be extended? Why should you, in this, manner cut off a large portion of your inhabitants from all the benefits of the admirable constitution of your country? Neither motives of humanity nor of patriotism have sanctioned this mode of enlisting for life, and it confessedly stands in the way of raising recruits. What can they know about their country, boys taken from under the roofs of their parents or masters, shut out of the pale of the constitution? How can they know any thing about it, till wounds, or decrepitude, or old age, drive them lo it? Why should we take children abroad and shut them out for ever, with all the consequences before you, of the ill effects it must necessarily have upon the popular feeling towards the military service? How can their minds be raised to a just estimate and admiration and love of the glorious constitution of this great country, to a sense of that equality of rights which knows no distinction between the meanest, arid the greatest and highest of their fellow subjects? How can they feel with the manly and heroic ardour with which they should744feel, when they have to fight for a country and a constitution, whose benefits and blessings are greater than those of Any other that has existed on the face of the globe? How delightful must it hot be to them to know, that at the expiration of their time they may return to the bosom of that country, to their friends, and relatives, and connections of every kind, and enjoy that happiness, for which they have fought and exposed themselves to danger and death in the field of battle, in distant climes, and on adverse shores! Let them return! Let them come back again, and repose in the glorious shade of that parental tree, under whose, branches they were reared Let them see its perfections, let them smell the fragrance of its blossoms, and taste the sweets of its fruits.&#x2014;Before I conclude, I wish to make a serious appeal to a description of members in this house, who are peculiarly interested in the repeal of this wretched bill; I mean the country gentlemen, who should consider the measure, in the present instance, as proceedingde novo.I ask them, will they give their sanctions to this additional tax on the landed property of Great Britain, after it has been proved to be a measure that can never be attended with any of the good effects that were promised by it, and has been shewn to be fraught with the most atrocious injustice? Next to them, I must call upon those who were the supporters, and many of them members of the late administration; I call upon the colleagues of the deposed minister, and his friends, amongst whom I am entitled to class a number of the country gentlemen, to preserve their consistency, and to be mindful of the arguments they themselves used last year, in opposition to the act of which I am now moving the repeal. I, in common with them, gave that minister my feeble support as far as it went. I did so in an independent, and, I trust, an honourable manner, without detaching myself in the least from my hon. friend hear me (Mr. Fox), nor from any of those other honourable friends, with whom I am proud to have uniformly acted, and whose principles I shall never abandon. I supported that noble lord (Sidmouth) because I considered him to have acted generally with a view to what he considered to be the good of the country, with an honest disposition, and with, a proper respect for the sound principles of the constitution; but most of all did I support him because I745considered him as a bar to the return of the right hon. gent. opposite roe to power. I now appeal to air those who acted then merely upon similar views with myself, to concur with me now in voting for the repeal of a measure which has already totally failed, and which they themselves have previously condemned. I surely cannot expect them, after all the reprobation expressed of this execrable law, before it had a trial, now having been proved an ineffective, cruel, and oppressive measure, to turn round upon me suddenly, and, without assigning any new reason, say, 'This is a good, a just, and a very humane law!' I implore them not to act in such a manner as to make us ashamed of having opposed the measure on its first proposal. It would not be regular in me to allude to any thing which may have passed in debate in another place, where I am told a noble lord (Sidmouth) did not speak, of this measure in such a manner as I might have expected from him; but, perhaps, noble lords, when transferred to the other house, may not think themselves so much pledged to what has passed here, as we do who remain. Let all these descriptions of gentlemen to whom I have alluded, put their hands to their hearts; and say, as men of honour, whether, if the late reconciliation had not taken place between the noble lord alluded to, and the right hon. gent. opposite me, they would not vote with me on the present question? If so, how can they reconcile any opposition to my motion, with the opinions they before so loudly proclaimed, and which, after the trial, has justified the condemnation they before pronounced upon it? It is evident this bill is a bill of excessive taxation. If the war is to be vigorously prosecuted till we can obtain a safe, and an honourable peace, additional burdens must be laid upon the people; and if so, never was there a moment when it behoved us to be more cautious how we lay them on, so that the people may not only bear them with cheerfulness, but pay them with willingness. I remember the day when the character of the independent country gentlemen, for whom certainly no man can have more respect than I have, stood much higher in this house and in the country, than it does at present. I hope they will this night recollect, that their rank and reputation never were diminished, till they were sunk during the seventeen years of the former746administration of the author of this measure, whose corrupt and unprincipled system of bestowing titles to the number of more than one moiety of the other branch, of the legislature, at the same time lowered the ancient dignity of the peerage, and impaired and undermined the independence of the house of commons, and the confidence reposed in it by the people of the country. I know that it is sometimes represented as invidious to deal in distinctions between one description of members and another; but, it would be unmanly in me, feeling as I do, to abstain from them, when, by detaching from this house, those to whom the mass of the people look with most veneration and confidence, there is a gradual introduction into the constitution of the anomaly of a popular assembly, uncontrolable by the sentiments of the people. I therefore once more coujure the country gentlemen to keep themselves, on this occasion, aloof from all party prejudices. Let us endeavour to regain the conifidence of the people, without which we can bring nothing to a successful issue in this great and perilous contest. If we so act, and the question of our safety is at issue, then I think we shall stand on impregnable ground; we shall have at command all the willing energies of the country, and that confidence which will enable us to meet any danger to which we can be exposed, without panic or dismay. It is by securing to ourselves this confidence, that we can best secure the co-operation and assistance of those powers on the continent who may be disposed to make a common cause with us; by convincing them that, instead of having no more than treaties with the ministers and with government to depend upon, they are making an alliance with the hearts and hands of the people of this country; and, most of all, it is by this reliance on the hearts of our brave country men, that we may bid a stern defiance to all the furious threats and efforts of the daring malice and perturbed ambition of the most powerful, most inveterate, and most oppressive and tyrannical enemy that ever vowed the overthrow of an ancient and splendid monarchy, and the destruction of a great, a generous, a brave, a free, and a happy people.

{"date": ["1805", "mar", "06"], "content": "said, he could not help remarking, how very naturally arid willingly the fight hon. gent, had deviated from the subject before the house, and had made excursions from it to other topics with which it was by no means connected. The right hon. gent, had first endeavoured to point out diversities of opinion between him and his hon. friend who opened the debate, and then between him and himself, on former occasions. On the former of those supposed diversities of opinion, the right hon. gent, had remarked with such violence, as must have induced persons who had not heard the speech of his hon. friend who opened the business, to suppose that he had attempted to conceal that any such diversity Subsisted. Such, however, was well known to the house, and such had been particularly marked by his hon. friend this night in opening the debate. There was nothing inconsistent in his hon. friend, who thought a variety of force was not detrimental to the military service of the country, and in him who thought otherwise, agreeing, that there was nevertheless a necessity for going into a committee on the military defence of the country. It had been stated by him the other night, that the volunteers were not the force on which we ought at present to rely alone, and sin this opinion, he had reason to believe his hon. friend and he were not so much at variance as was generally imagined. That, however,763was a subject with which, like the former, they had nothing at present to do. They might like or might dislike the volunteer system; but whatever was their opinion on that subject, it had nothing to do with the propriety of going into a committee to see what might be done more effectually for the defence of the country, or with their concurring in the repeal of the act now under discussion, as being essential to the enactment of a measure of greater efficiency. When fundamental points on which a diversity of opinion had been entertained by gentlemen in that house did not present themselves for consideration, it would be an act rather too hard to say that they were not entitled to acquiesce in any other points connected with the subject, by which, nevertheless, in the opinion of both, the end which they had mutually in view was likely to be attained. As to his own individual diversity from himself, with which lie had been charged by the right hon. gent, he could only declare, that his opinions on grand and constitutional points had never varied, and were during the whole time of his co-operation with the right hon. gent, the same as they were at the present moment. He had adhered to his opinions&#x2014; the right hon. gent, had deserted his. The right hon. gent, need not suppose that he had forgotten what had passed during the period in which he was in office along with the right hon. gent. Whether he was a party or not a party to those measures, he would now, however, speak of them according to the impression and conviction the result of them, had left on his mind. He could not he answerable, any more than the house, for the measures which had then passed, but whether he had since changed his opinion, or they had not been agreeable to his opinion at the time, and he had felt himself Secluded by the situation which he held from putting a bar in the way of what had been resolved on by the cabinet in general, it would be subversive of all moral feeling and, principle, that when he came to see the inadequacy or mischievous tendency of any acts to the passing of which he had in any way been accessary, that be should be hound up from afterwards declaring his: change of opinion. Such, he conceived, was not to be required of any person holding situation in the management, of public affairs. But the right hon. gent, in a climax of triumph, had clinched his argument his (Mr. W. s) responsibility, by stating that he was then even secretary.764at war. He confessed he had a good share in carrying on the war business out of doors; but he declared that he had no more to do with the bills alluded to, in his capacity of secretary at war, than if he had been secretary to the board of agriculture. But what had been the conduct of the right hon. gent? Did it not go to a condemnation of every one measure of which he had been the original projector? Was not the ballot system of his introduction? Who ever hoard of such enormous bounties as had lately been common, till they necessarily followed from measures recommended by the right hon. gent, himself? The right hon. gent, had, indeed, profited a little by the suggestions of him and his friends. He wished he had carried their suggestions further; and he was satisfied if he had; wished to profit by experience, he had sufficient opportunities of doing so from the errors, of his own administration&#x2014;The principal ground, however, on which he had, from the beginning, objected to the bill was, the oppressive and dangerous tendency of the practices which it was calculated to encourage. The harshness of the measure itself could never, in his eyes, have been done away, had the bill been ever so successful. On no principle could it be contended that parish officers were to be esteemed better recruiters than any other, than on that very ground on which they were totally unfit to be recruiters at all. In their hands nothing but harsh and improper means of fulfilling their task, could be expected to be resorted to. How far men would be induced to exercise the power vested in them tyrannically, was evident from experience; and, in order to shew what little chance the poor man had of being protected in his right, he need only to refer to a recent event which formed a part of the practice now prevalent in, this metropolis. Was it not a fact, that a, number of poor Irishmen, making merry at their own houses, in that affecting kind of festivity which the day they were celebrating rendered doubly sacred, had been attacked by the meddling and vexatious, interference of magisterial authority; had been accused of the worst of crimes; had been left all night in prison; and, afterwards, some of them driven into exile&#x2014; for the worst of exile was the sea, to a man who had not been bred to it; and this, because they could, not give a satisfactory, account of themselves; or, in other words, were poor men? Was there law, he would765ask, in this kingdom, for such a stretch of authority? Was it to be found even in the count of exchequer chamber, with all the judges of the land assembled to give it sanction? Yet such had been the conduct of some of the inferior magistrates of this metropolis; and was he not right in his original fears expressed on the subject of this bill? and was he not now again entitled to urge, that such would be the species of law which the arming parish officers with the powers of this act would naturally produce? Was he not even justified in supposing that the parish crimps might have, persons present who might procure this sea to he changed into a military service, and, of course, that those very men who were thus illegally dragged from their own homes, served to swell the lists which had lately been laid on the table, or would make their appearance in the next return&#x2014; There was another reason, however, on which it was apparent that the bill was not deserving of support. With all its objectionable features, it had wholly failed of its object. This, however, was flatly contradicted, and an attempt was made by soothing argument to recall the dead carcase of this bill to life. Whatever might be said of its remote design, or of its immediate operation, he presumed all must agree it had been completely obstructed. Where were the 60 battalions which were to have been raised? The army of reserve was to feed the permanent force, and this was to feed the army of reserve. A copious river was to pour forth its waters, and it has been converted into a contemptible rill. The right hon. gent, with some artificial discretion, had told the house he would not expose what had been done by the bill, but he would have recourse to his rule of three, and acquaint gentlemen what it would do. It had been inefficient; but, he said, try it longer, arid it will succeed. So said the empiric&#x2014;\"The spring is approaching, you will find yourself better.\" The quackery was renewed, and in the mean lime the patient died. Like those pharmaceutic pretenders, the right hon. gent, would never be satisfied of the deficiency of his skill until it was too late to avoid the consequences of his temerity. But this bill was an experiment. This was a philosophic age, and every thing was to be submitted to the test of experiment. The pence of Amiens, which was to restore tranquillity to Europe, oppressed and exhausted, was an experiment. Scientific766persons, by experiment, meant something which was to be tried, not the matter itself, for the sake of which the trial was made; but here all was submitted to experiment, on the large Scale, and chance and accident were exchanged for political Wisdom and security. The house ought hot to consent to be put off with experiment after experiment, merely to gratify the projector&#x2014;The right hon. gent, however, lorded It over the regular recruiting, and alleged that his mode had been equally successful, if not more so, than the old mode of recruiting for the army. That, however, was one of the main, grounds on which he had from the beginning reprobated the right hon. gent.'s measure. He had stated all along, and it was now confirmed by experience, that so far from being an innocent bill, not Only could it do no good Itself, but it had even impeded the regular recruiting by not Only continuing, but even enhancing the bounties The right hon. gent, had complained that the measure had, in some respect, been treated with ridicule. He could not help thinking that there never was a bill so much entitled to be treated with ridicule, nor one where ridicule was so much the test of truth. If gentlemen had exerted themserlves to devise arty thing which should be calculated to excite ridicule against the govt. what could they have invented more likely to produce it than the mere project of recruiting the regular army by parish officers? It was impossible to speak of It as a great and solemn political measure; but, however laughable it might be in its origin, it was most grave arid tragical in its consequences. It was a little singular that to a measure of this nature the right hon. gent, had directed his attention to so little purpose. There was a species of vulgar produce, the turnip, well known hi the county with which be was best acquainted, that was well adapted to the poor soil, which extensively prevailed there: in the rich loams Of other districts it grew rank and degenerated. Perhaps a subject so plain and familiar as that which was connected with the present question was not suited to the fertile invention and warm imagination of the right hon. gent. There was a class of writers who had devoted much of then time to the contemplation Of picturesque effect, and in the selection of a place of habitation enquired not Where the greatest accommodation could be afforded, but where the eye767would be most exquisitely gratified. The right hon. gent, was liable to a perversion of intellect not very dissimilar; he did not seem so much to consider what measures would most redound to the substantial advantage of the country, as what view he could present of them by his flowery speeches in the house of commons. The object of the present motion of his hon. friend was to avoid the most afflicting events. We were now thoughtlessly proceeding, squandering away the most valuable time. There was no ground for confidence, either from the merit of the measure, or from the authority and wisdom of those who adopted it. The right hon. gent, then concluded, by declaring, that he should have conceived the bill a bad measure, even if it had succeeded. It would, in his opinion, have gradually eaten up and undermined the ordinary recruiting for the army. It had, however, so completely failed, that he was convinced every gentleman who came up from the country in the beginning of this session, expected it would have been one of the first acts of the right hon. gent, himself to move for its repeal.", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-windham-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

He wished, therefore, that the house should not go away impressed with the statements of the right hon. gent, which were for the greater part incorrect. The house might also wish to hear the sentiments of the noble lord (Castlereagh) who formed a part of the last administration, as well as the opinion of the hon. and learned gent, opposite to him (the attorney general), on an interesting subject of this nature, and one on which they had already addressed the house. The right hon. the chancellor the exchequer had confined him-self-ajmost entirely to denying the detail submitted by his hon. friend (Mr. Sheridan) and gave up the principal of the measure;768he no longer insisted on the enthusiasm with which it would be adopted, or urged the sympathy which would exist between the recruits raised for local or county regiments; when he abandoned that ground, he gave up, of course, the substance and efficiency of the bill, according to the right hon. gent's, own ideas at its introduction. He should, therefore, from his own shewing, vote for the repeal of a bill, the ground of which he had thus relinquished. Now, as to the detail. On the 29th of June 1804, this act was passed: in 14 days county meetings were to be held, and in one month the parishes of the kingdom were to be in a general state of activity to raise 16,000 men to supply the deficiencies. This ground-work was all to be performed by the 1st of Oct. 1804. But it was found this ponderous machine could not proceed. A noble lord in the home department then applied his shoulders to the wheel: still it was immoveable: it resisted the efforts also of all the lords-lieutenant of the counties. In this distressing predicament the ministers, on their own authority, suspended the operation of the bill until the 15th of Nov. considerably after all its salutary effects were to have been enjoyed. Thus, the executive government, represented by the secretary of state, assumed to itself the power of preventing the influence of a legislative regulation. It was not, however, perfectly correct to assert that its entire operation was postponed to the 15th of Nov. and this was one of the fallacies with which the right hon. gent, had amused the house. As far as related to raising men, its agency commenced on the 5th of September: it was not the opposition within that house; it was not the resistance from exterior causes, but it was the absolute impossibility of carrying the act into execution, which occasioned this delay. The procrastination proposed on the assessment of the penalties was until the 15th November; but the truth was, that no order was given for this purpose until the 18th of the month latently expired. The right hon. gent, enquired, \"are we to suppose the act will not fulfil the intentions of its authors, and that it will not, because it has not provided men?\" And when its incompetency at present was pressed as a rational ground to presume its continued insufficiency, the objection is met by the declaration, that the operation of the bill was alone extended to the most exhausted parts of the king-769dom. Was ever argument so idle and evasive? The numbers that were to have been raised were 27,000: of these, 9,000 were to have been acquired from the counties, between the 1st of Oct. 1804, and the same period in 1805. All this time had been lost; the bill had been suspended, and the house was now to be told, that the activity would be in the precise ratio of its inactivity to the present hour. The right hon. gent, said, with respect to immediate means of defence, the kingdom was in a state of security. The foundation of this assertion deserved to be examined. He insisted that he had a right to contend, and be convinced from what had occurred hitherto, that this bill would never be of and avail, and was most unjust and oppressive to the people as well as destructive to the recruiting system. It was utterly impossible to raise, men under it but by exacting the penalty, which would prove a most vexatious and intolerable tax. In this opinion he was the more confirmed from hearing the weak defence and flimsy speech of the right hon. gent, (Mr. Canning) that night. The right hon. gent, said, however, that the country was in a stale of perfect security, and recounted the number of our force; but he could not induce himself to expect as much from the exertions of the volunteers as the right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer or his hon. friend (Mr. Sheridan) seemed to do. He was a volunteer himself, and respected that body as much as any man; but too much reliance should not be placed on their supposed superior discipline at present. It was rather strange also, that their numbers had diminished so considerably from last year, when the number was returned to have been 480,000, and were at present reduced to 366,000. He only mentioned this circumstance, in order to shew the abusurdity of exulting sometimes on account of numbers, which were subject to such sudden casualties and diminution. With respect to the state of our general defence, he should not hesitate to say that we were as much exposed to the enemy at present, as at any period since the renewal of hostilities. He was one of those who cons dered the danger as great now, if not greater than heretofore; because the enemy, ever active, had not relaxed a moment from the prosecution of his plans against this country, and had time to accumulate his forces in all the points from which our coast was most assailable he collected his770forces, and carried on his preparations, even by sea, in spite of all our efforts to prevent him. The catamaran attempts made during the last summer to annoy him without effect must have convinced him that we could not discomfit his projects. If any doubt remained respecting the inutility of blockading, it must be removed at present, when it was certain that two of his squadrons had put to sea some time since, notwithstanding the extreme vigilance of our fleets. He understood also, that no intelligence whatever had yet arrived as to their destination, which probably would be heard of when they had struck a dreadful blow in some quarter. It could not be said therefore, that we were in perfect security, or that the danger had passed. When the country was thus situated, he submitted to the house that this bill should be repealed; for, if continued, it would obstruct the raising of a supply for the army, and if removed, a better plan might be substituted.", "author_id": "/people/mr-samuel-whitbread-2", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

He disclaimed any idea of giving a factious opposition to the govt.; but he felt it incumbent on him to declare, that with all the consideration he had been enabled to give the additional force act, if the repeal of it depended upon his single vote, he should think it his duty to vote in the affirmative, and upon grounds that were perfectly satisfactory to his own mind. Conscientiously speaking, he was firmly convinced of the wisdom of the military plans of that administration with which he had been connected; and as this bill went to render null the whole of them, he thought him-773self, upon principles of consistency, obliged to vote for its repeal. The right hon. gent. here entered into a very clear and elaborate justification of the measures of defence resorted to by the late administration. Their object in suspending the army of reserve act, was to relieve the country from a very onerous pressure, and to employ those milder measures which they had reason to think would be more efficient. The right hon. member then enumerated the various modes which they had proposed for recruiting the army, all of which, and particularly the raising eight battalions for rank, he defended against the unmerited imputations which had been lavished on them. His great objections to the bill, which it was moved to repeal, were founded on constitutional grounds, and never could, by any temporary, or even the greatest possible success, be wholly done away. It tended to. create a great permanent standing army, a description of force which had ever been regarded with a constitutional jealousy in that house. Operating as an amercement, it was oppressive beyond measure; the effect of it would be, to say to the parishes, you shall be heavily fined; you shall be subject to the payment of extravagant and burdensome impositions, unless you can get men to work cheaper than they find it to be their interest or inclination to do. Not wishing this measure should stand in the way of that popularity which he perceived the administration was anxious to obtain, he was desirous that it should not go forward. The country was convinced it had failed, and, therefore, confidently expected its repeal. Even if it had succeeded to the most sanguine wishes of the. proposers, on the return of peace he should have thought it the duty of the house to repeal it. He felt himself bound, upon principles of consistency, and wishing to. pay those marks of respect and affection to the late administration, which he felt they, deserved from him, and which, perhaps, at no distant period, the country would feel were due to them, to vote in support of the motion", "author_id": "/people/mr-george-tierney", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1805", "mar", "06"], "content": "&#x2014;Sir; at this late hour, and after the very ample discussion this subject has already obtained, I shall detain the house but for a very few moments. A right hon. gent. (Mr. Bragge Bathurst) has said, that it is not fair to ask him to state upon his honour what would have been his774conduct with respect to any measure in different circumstances; and that it is sufficient for him to give his honest opinion of it when it comes before him. The right hon. gent. last year stated his sentiments on this very bill; and though he has not thought proper to tell us what the sentiments of himself. and his noble relation (lord Sidmouth) oh the subject were, previous to the late reconciliation, I cannot help believing that they must have formed some opinion in the course of the summer. The right hon. gent. says, too, that it never entered into his contemplation, or into the minds of those persons who, as well, as himself, have been alluded to by my hon. friend, the mover of the present motion, to engage in a litigious, a vexatious, and a factious opposition to government. Doubtless, they would not engage. in an opposition which they themselves thought so; and they may fairly suppose that others would not do so, or at least confess that their opposition was litigious and vexatious. This declaration of the right hon. gent. does not surprize me to any great degree; for when I recollect the opposition which he himself gave to the very bill of. which my hon. friend now proposes the repeal, I cannot, I say, help believing, that he and his friends did, in the course of the autumn, come to some mature consideration as to how they should vote, not only upon this bill, so much the object of their former animadversion, but possibly, upon every other measure of the present government. But the distinction of the right hon. gent. is extremely curious. When the measure was first proposed in June last, then the opposition given to it by the right hon. gent. and his friends was fair, manly, and honourable; but now that it has totally failed, now that it is scouted from one end of the kingdom to the other, any opposition to it is stigmatised as being litigious, factious, vexatious, and I know not what. But the right hon. gent. puts another notable case. He says that those who oppose a war do not always move for peace. This is true, because it is not an easy matter to repeal a war like an act of parliament; and when a war is once commenced, it is not practicable at any moment to obtain a peace, nor may it be prudent to move for it. But surely this case has no analogy whatever to an act of parliament which experience has condemned; a measure which, professing to raise men, imposes only an oppressive and un-775equal tax on the community. Can any man doubt of its failure? Suppose the right hon. gent. opposite to me were to come forward in his official situation, and propose and recommend, with all his powers of persuasion, a tax to the house, which he should state as likely to produce two millions, and which in the sequel should only be productive to the amount of a twentieth part of that sum, what would the house, and what would the public think of him? Would not those who originally opposed this tax, who forewarned him, and who foretold him that it would be inefficient, would they not, I say, feel themselves bound to move for the repeal of it? It has been insinuated by the right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer, that on the division on the motion of my right hon. friend (Mr. Windham) the other night, we retired into the lobby rather reluctantly and sulkily. For myself I can assure the right hon. gent. that I quilted the house with no feelings of that sort; but when it is considered, that I had the honour to submit a similar motion last session to the house, in which I had the concurrence of upwards of 200 members, and that this year the number is under 100; when it is considered, that that right hon. gent. by whom I am so little in the habit of being supported, and of whose support, therefore, I am covetous, did on that occasion vote for my motion, and that without any change in our situation, except this identical bill, he on that night voted against a motion precisely similar, it would not have been very surprising if some degree of chagrin on this side of the house had been discovered.&#x2014;It has been objected by a right hon. gent. (Mr. Bragge Bathurst) intimately connected with the head of the last administration, that there are material differences of opinion with respect to the military system fit to be adopted among gentlemen with whom I have the satisfaction to act. The members of the junction or coalition on this side of the house may possibly differ on some trifling particulars; for instance, I and my right hon. friend (Mr. Windham) do, as it happens, entertain rather different sentiments from my hon. friend the mover of the question, respecting the volunteers. Yet, surely, these differences of opinion with regard to the volunteer system, are not now for the first time announced; and last year, though fully as great as now, they formed no objection to the right hon.776gent. the present chancellor of the exchequer's voting along with persons so differing, for a committee of the whole house to consider of the military defence of the country. Those differences, indeed, it has never been attempted to disguise. I suspect, however, that the coalition on the other side will never be arraigned for any such difference of opinion. On the contrary, when I consider the circumstances under which it was effected, the time at which it took place, and the purposes for which it was brought about, I have no doubt that both sides will bring with them such a pleasing disposition to mutual agreement and mutual forgiveness, that there never will be any more differences between them. The right hon. gent. on the floor has talked of a junction and a coalition of discordant parties. But let me tell the right hon. gent. that he is the last man iii the world who ought to throw out taunts against that coalition. Did he find fault with it last year? Would he be sitting in the place he now occupies if it were not for that coalition? Would the \"weak, imbecile administration,\" as he called it, have been turned out? Or, to complete the climax, does he believe that this bill would have passed, if that junction which he now treats with contempt had not been effected? With respect to the question of coalitions, my right hon. friend (Mr. Windham), has, in my opinion, said quite enough to repel any charge of that kind. I have always been of opinion, that unless public men can be persuaded to lay aside their animosities on past transactions, which do not necessarily influence their conduct in different circumstances, it would be impossible to continue that species of government which has existed in this country since the revolution. For instance, what is there to hinder those who formerly differed about the American war from agreeing as to the policy of this country towards American independence? Or what is there to prevent those who differed about the late French war, from concurring in the measures to be adopted in another war? But what has been the conduct of the right hon. gent? What were the grounds of his opposition to the late administration? It was not this or that measure that he objected to, but he arraigned the whole of their measures as the offspring of folly, weakness, and Heaven knows what else! Did he not publicly brand them with the epithets incapable and imbecile? Did he777not insinuate that they had as little honour as sense? And has he not restored all those weak and incapable men to the ministry, with all their unfitness? Even all this violence and personality could be surmounted, and the right hon. gent. may say to his new allies, \"though I called you fool, though I called you imbecile, though I represented you as not possessing more virtue than understanding, yet now I have got your places, I don't care if you are regarded as a very meritorious, sensible set of people.\"&#x2014;I know it is not regular to advert to what took place on a former debate, but before I proceed to examine the bill itself, I wish just to take notice of an observation made by a right hon. gent. (Mr. Canning), that besides the vast merits of this bill, the improvement of our naval situation has been so great as of itself to be an argument against any inquiry. The right hon. gent. has thrown out a challenge respecting the merits of the late and present naval department, which, I trust, will in the course of the present session, be accepted; when possibly, the late board of admiralty, which has been subjected to so much uncalled-for censure on the part of the right hon. gent. opposite me, may, when they come to be weighed against each other, be found to possess as much vigour as the present.&#x2014;All those who recollect the speech of the right hon. gent. when he proposed this famous bill, which was to work such instantaneous prodigies, must remember that the professed object of it was to raise \"forthwith\" a very considerable number of men. But what has it done? The prospect held out was, that it would procure an immediate force of 18,000 men before October last, and a farther supply of 9,000 were to be added before October 1805, being in all 27,000 men. But what is the fact? This measure, which we were pompously told was calculated for the immediate exigency, had in the first 15 weeks produced only 1581 men in England, Ireland, and Scotland; and of these 1581, only 640 were raised between the 15th of Sept. and the 6th of Nov; but supposing, for the sake of argument, that those 1581 were all raised in England within 15 weeks, that would be no justification of the bill; for the question is not about 6O or 100 or 200 men a week. It must now produce 850 per week, in order to complete the number which it ought to raise before October next. Who, then, will contend that the bill has not completely and totally failed?778When the right hon gent. triumphantly promised and pledged himself, that its operation would produce, within a certain time, 27,000 men, the difficulties, the innumerable difficulties in the way of its execution were foretold to him. It has been said, that the bill was carried by a small majority, and that it had to encounter the effect of much opposition. I do not believe that any obstacle whatever, arising from this cause, has been opposed to the bill. But did I not, at the time, warn the right hon. gent. not to push this bill against the sense of the majority of the English members of parliament, because even a measure, the principle of which might be good, could not be advantageously brought forward, against the sense of the public at large? It is said, too, that expectations have gone abroad, that the bill would be repealed. But what sort of a defence of a measure is it to say, that its absurdities are so palpable and its inefficacy so manifest, that all men believed it was to be repealed; and is not this to acknowledge, rather than to palliate the failure? A noble lord (Sidmouth) formerly a member of this house, but now at the head of his majesty's council (for the right hon. gent. is extremely tenacious of the singular number on this occasion) did, on the bringing in of this bill, propose that it should be postponed until the ensuing session, in order to ascertain the sense of the country respecting it, in the interval. I confess I was one who did not approve of that advice, as the right hon. gent. promised that his bill would produce immediate benefit and assistance. It is somewhat strange, however, that now, when it has been tried and found totally inefficient, the same right hon. gent. should step forward, and tell us that it ought not to be repealed. It has unquestionably failed as to men; and the right hon. gent. has disclaimed any idea of ever employing it as an instrument of taxation, and to this declaration I am disposed to give implicit belief. It is impossible that any one, standing in his situation, could ever resort to so infamous, so vexatious, and so unequal a mode of taxation. For, how is it to be employed? Why, as a threat. It is not the fine but the dread of the parish officers that is to get the men. A more flagrant instance of oppression never was heard of in the history of the world. It is a principle that is in itself a reason for the repeal of this bill. We are told that the bill has assisted the recruiting for the779regular army. But in what manner has it done so? Is it not merely by the negative parts of it, by suspending the competition and the high bounties? Acting with my right hon. friend (Mr. Windham), and acting under him, as I shall always be proud to do, we always said that such would be its effects, when this bill came into active operation, and yet this which is- now held out as one of the merits of the bill, was formerly ridiculed as the suggestion of a wild and fanciful imagination. Such are the miserable shifts to which the advocates of the bill are driven for arguments in its defence! The right hon. gent has said, that the object of my hon. friend's motion is the removal of a minister. The right hon gent. with great humility, professes his readiness to bow to the decision of the house, but I suspect he is pretty sure that such decision will not be against him; for I remember, when he was rather more in danger last year, he was not disposed to be quite so obedient. I do think that the right hon. gent. is bound in honour and in generosity to state his recantation of all the opprobrious and contemptuous terms in which he spoke of the late administration; for I do maintain, that whatever there is of vigour or energy in his military plans is solely to be attributed to the measures adopted by his predecessors. I am willing to admit that I was one of those who wished for the return of the right hon. gent to office, in preference to those whom he succeeded. The right hon. gent. therefore owes it to those who assisted in the overthrow of the late ministry, deeming them unfit for their stations, to shew that he is more able, more vigorous, and more energetic than they were. He owes it to his own honour and reputation, to furnish some better proof of his superior claims to the confidence of the nation than such a miserable bill as the present. No man is more disposed to subscribe to the great talents of the right hon. gent. than I am. No man, in the, course of the many years we have been opposed to each, other, has had more reason to subscribe to them; but if any thing could allow me to entertain a doubt of the wisdom and ability of the right hon. gent. it would be the imprudence of staking his reputation on this bill, the operation of which does not furnish one argument which the partiality of friendship can possibly consider as the mark of an enlarged and vigorous mind.", "author_id": "/people/mr-charles-fox-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

{"date": ["1805", "mar", "08"], "content": "rose for the purpose of opposing the resumption of the debate now. His intention was, if the house should agree with him in negativing that motion, to follow up the question by a motion for hearing counsel on behalf of the sheriff's previous to resuming the debate on some future day, it was not his wish to enter830into the merits of, the question, nor to discuss, whether evidence, should be. examined. At the bar, or the resolutions of Committee be adopted by the house? These considerations were altogether out of his view in the present instance. However these questions might be finally disposed of, he contended that the house could not consistently with justice agree to the report without bearing what the parties had to say. It had been argued on a former day, that it would be idle in the house to try this question, because if had already been fully tried by the committee themselves, on oath, and on evidence taken, upon oath, with the advantage of the comments of counsel, and a view of the countenances of the witnesses. The question therefore was, whether the house should or should not agree to the? report of the committee, without the advantage at least of hearing counsel. The committee had given to the house with its report, the evidence that had been taken before it, in order to enable the house to ascertain, whether the resolutions were borne out by the evidence; and be maintained, that no hon. gent, would consistently agree to them, until be was convinced of their being so borne out He did not argue that all the evidence should be gone over, but that gentlemen should have the assistance of counsel to guide their judgments upon that which had been laid before there He understood that the noble lord who, had so ably presided over both the Middlesex committees, intended to support the motion for hearing counsel, and he hoped, the committee would act with the same, noble impartiality. There was one preliminary question which it was necessary to establish here. If the sheriffs had not been, heard at all, neither the right hon. gent opposite, nor any other gent. could contend that they ought not to be heard. If heard at all, they ought to be heard fully; and what evidence had the house, to what extent they had been heard, whether to their own satisfaction fully, completely and impartially? It appeared indeed that; they had been heard, but he denied that they had been folly beard; and if the house should decide against the hearing of counsel, it would be better for the returning officer not to be heard at all before the committee. Besides, the whole of the evidence was not before the house, but such parts of it as the noble lord and the committee bad selected as sufficient to en-831able the house to form a judgment of the conduct of the sheriff. In his mind the whole evidence should be had for that purpose, and counsel ought to be heard to ascertain whether any more than they had was necessary. The sheriffs had no notice of their conduct having been under consideration until they accidentally heard of it, and when they applied to have the consideration deferred until after the whole of the case should be gone through, in order that they might have the benefit of all the evidence that might be produced, which was denied them. They had but a single day to prepare their briefs and defence, and that was five mouths previous to the resolutions being adopted by the committee. There was nothing, he contended, in the act, which gave the committee a power to try the sheriffs. The right hon. gent. Had triumphantly stated that the whole matter of the petition was referred to the committee. This he admitted quoad the seat, but not as to the sheriffs, any more than as to peers who might have interfered in the election, or any other persons not implicated in it. The committee quoad the seat, acted as a petty jury whose decision was final; but resembled a grand jury in their proceedings, touching such other matters, the house having reserved to itself the right of final decision upon them. In the case of Mr. Davison, no mention had been made of him in the petition from Ilehelster, though something came out in evidence before the Committee which they made the ground of special report. What course did the house adopt? Did they send him to Newgate? No, they sent him to his trial. All the precedents were against the opinion of the right hon. gent. In the Shoreham case, which had occurred within a year after the passing of Mr. Grenville's Bill, whilst Sir G. Saville, Lord J. Cavendish, Mr. Dunning, and Mr. Wedderburne, who had been the most strenuous and zealous supporters of that bill, were in the house, no conclusion was come to against the returning Officer till he was heard in his defence. There was no other precedent which, bore upon the present case. With respect to the general question he should beg leave to submit a few questions to the house, which, to save them trouble and time, he should answer himself, and by monosyllables. Does the house, or does the law, give a copy of the charge against them to the returning, offi-832cers? No.&#x2014;Have the committee power to bring the returning officers to trial? no?&#x2014;Have the returning officers power to oblige the committee to try them? No &#x2014;Have they the right of challenging any number of the jury by which they are to try them? No.&#x2014;Have they a voice in appointing them? No.&#x2014;Have they a voice in appointing nominees? no. In a case where there were three parties, two were allowed to chuse nominees in the house, whilst the third was put upon trial without any such advantage. He contended therefore, that the sheriffs had aright to be heard by counsel. It had been frequently of late thrown in the teeth of the house that they could not examine witnesses on oath. This could never have been the spirit of the constitution, and if they had not that power, it was time they should have it, and he was sure no branch of the legislature would object to it. Here he thought it not amiss to advert to what had been the practice of the Irish parliament in similar cases. The question often occurred, and the practice had been to retry the sheriffs, and hear over all the evidence. This had been found troublesome and laborious to the house, and therefore they passed an act, whereby the copy of the charge was directed to be given to the sheriff, and the committee had power to try the whole case, so that decision was final and conclusive on the house. On a future day he, should move for leave to bring in a bill similar to that which had been passed in Ireland. He concluded by moving that the word \"now\" be left out.", "author_id": "/people/mr-richard-sheridan-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1805", "mar", "06"], "content": "then rose to reply, and spoke nearly as follows:&#x2014;After the attentive hearing with which I was honoured in the former part of the evening, I think the house will do me the credit to believe that it is not my intention to trespass much on their time at this late period. I shall, however, avail myself of the privilege granted to the opener of a motion, to say a few words in reply to the objections which have been started against the motion which I have had the honour to submit to the house. I can assure the house, that what I have to say shall be short, for though I value volunteering very highly, I certainly am not over zealous to reply to speeches which were totally destitute of any thing in the shape of argument. I was not sur-782prized that the noble lord felt so forcibly that he and his friends were called on for some answer, and to state their reasons for still supporting this bill. If they had given no answer, it might very fairly have been inferred, that it was because they had no answer to give. In their answer, however, they took care to avoid the main objections that had been urged on this side of the house; namely, that the bill was unconstitutional in its principle, and had completely failed in its effect. The noble lord, however, conceives that the argument of the bill not having been fairly tried was quite too strong for the great abilities of my hon. friend (Mr. Fox) to combat; but, in no part of my hon. friend's speech did he more successfully grapple with the arguments of the supporters of the bill, than where he demonstrated that no future trial could possibly reconcile parliament and the country to it. The noble lord complains that the operation of the bill in Scotland and Ireland has been purposely passed over. But let it be recollected, that the bill to which the present motion immediately applies is confined to England, and has nothing whatever to do with Scotland or Ireland. And here, sir, I cannot help reminding the house, that the bill was carried against the sense of a considerable majbrity of the representatives of England. I do not mean to dispute the right of the members for the other parts of the United Kingdom to vote on such questions; but it is not difficult to conceive, that members for Scotland and Ireland by voting in support of a minister, on a question which does not affect their own constituents, might expect to have something conceded to them in the two bills which were to follow. The bill for Scotland has, however, failed still more than the one now under consideration. In Ireland, I am ready to admit, that proportionably more men have been raised by the parishes, but not one volunteer has inlisted for general service, which was the professed object of the bill. The right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer has told us, that if the bill should prove a measure of taxation, he will be the very first man to move for its repeat. Now it does appear, that altogether only 1250 men have been raised by the bill in England, and after deducting deaths and casualties, 681 is the number of men actually recruited by the parishes; consequently the remainder have been raised by fines and penalties, or, in other words, by783taxation. The right hon. gent. complains that I used harsh and violent language towards him, that I wandered from the subject in discussion, and sought to supply the defect of argument by personal reflections. Although I may be supposed to be sometimes a warm speaker in this house, I believe I have never been accused of harbouring much political animosity against any man. The right hon. gent. intended, I suppose, to contrast my violent language with his own singular gentleness and meekness of manners. This observation, he doubtless thought, came with peculiar propriety from a person of his own blushing humility; from a person so perfectly averse to all like ill-natured personalities; so eminently distinguished for soaring above all little political enmities, and so complete a foe to every thing sarcastic or biting. The right lion. gent. has thought proper to describe my speech as coming from a person who has never read the act it is proposed to repeal, and who knows nothing of it beyond its title. What I said is regarded by him as a collection of jests and sarcasms which have been for a long time stored up, in order that they may burst all at once on the meek, gentle, modest, but devoted head of the right hon. gent. If my speech, however, was so very unworthy of the serious attention of the house; if I did wander so very much from the object of the debate; if I did entertain the house with nothing but hoarded repartees or common-place jokes, is it not a little singular that the right hon. gent. should have done me the honour to start up immediately to answer me? The right hon. gent. well knew that his vast and splendid talents were not necessary to answer a speech, distinguished for nothing but irregularity:Nec Deus intersit, nisi dignus vindice nodusis a maxim which no man better understands than the right hon. gent. Why did he not on this, as on a former occasion, employ a substitute? The right hon. gent. supposes I said that when he went out of office he stood high in the opinion of the public. I said no such thing. I said, that he stood comparatively higher than when he returned to power. But though the right hon. gent. has replied to this observation, he has thought proper to take no notice of the reasons on which it was founded. Not a word of a certain pledge to the. Catholics of Ireland which he is known to have give on his abandonment784of the office to which he has since returned! No man is more ready to acknowledge the great and eminent talents of the right hon. gent. than I am. No man esteems them higher than I do. But if I were to characterize his ministry, I should say, in language which the right hon. gent. may recollect to have heard before, namely \"that he has added more to the burdens and subtracted more from the liberties of the people, than any minister that ever governed this country.\"&#x2014;The right hon. gent. has attacked me for bringing charges against his colleagues, who were not in this house to defend themselves, and has taken up the glove for the First Lord of the Admiralty. For my part, I really entertain a respect for the noble lord (Melville) as a man of business; certainly there are many differences between him and his predecessor. He does not, like the noble earl, pin himself down to his desk by four in the morning, examing into abuses, but he goes boldly afloat himself to superintend, or rather to judge with critical eyes (occulis subjecta fidelibus) of the explosion of his own catamarans, I will not call in question how nice an ear the noble lord may have for the blowing up of a carcase; nor do I wish to allude to the festivities at Walmer Castle, where the right hon. gent. opposite me had prepared a sort of Alexander's Feast, and where he and his friends were anxiously wailing for the noble lord's triumphal return:The jolly God in triumph comes,Sound the trumpets, beat the drums.Whether or not there was a Timotheus of their party report does not say; the jolly God however was not absent. There, like Alexander, \"he seized a torch with fury to destroy,\" and if he did not succeed, I suppose it was because there was no Thais at Walmer to lead the way.&#x2014;The right hon. gent. has thought fit to allude to the support which I gave to the noble lord (Sidmouth) now at the head of his majesty's council, when that noble lord was chancellor of the exchequer. He represents it as an insiduous and hollow support. I hope it is not my character to give any support of that description. He says I gave the noble lord a few votes when I knew they could be of no use to him, and that I opposed him when my support could alone have been of advantage to him. I say that this charge is contrary to fact. I gave my support to the late administration with the most perfect good faith, and I know that the noble lord has always been ready to785acknowledge it. But, supposing I had not supported him with fidelity and firmness. What then? I never had professed to do so, either to that administration, or to this house. I supported them because I approved of many of their measures, but principally was I induced to support them, because I considered their continuance in office as a security against the return to power of the right hon. gent. opposite me, which ever appeared to me as the greatest national calamity. If, indeed, I had recommended the noble lord to his majesty;&#x2014;if I had come down to this house, and described the noble lord as the fittest man in the country to fill the office of chancellor of the exchequer, because it was a convenient step to my own safety, in retiring from a situation which I had grossly abused and which I could no longer fill with honour and security;&#x2014;if, having seduced him into that situation, I had afterwards tapered off from a promised support, when I saw that the minister of my own choice was acquiring greater stability and popularity than I wished for;&#x2014;if, when t saw an opening to my own return to power, I had entered into a combination with others, whom I meant also to betray, from the sole lust of power and office, in Order to remove him;&#x2014;and if, under the dominion of these base appetites I had then treated with ridicule and contempt, the very man whom I had before held up to the choice of my sovereign, and the approbation of this house and the public;&#x2014;then, indeed, I should have merited the contempt and execration of all good men, and should have deserved to be told, that I was hollow and insincere in my support, and that I had acted a mean, a base, and a perfidious part.&#x2014;The house then divided, when there appeared,For Mr. Sheridan's motion127Against it267Majority against the motion140", "author_id": "/people/mr-richard-sheridan-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

The only delay that was chargeable to him was rendered desirable and necessary by many considerations. The motion he was about to offer was almost precisely the same as that offered by591his hon. friend on the bench above (Mr. Fox), on the 23d of June last; The terms of it were, that it should be referred to a committee, to review the several acts passed in the two last sessions for the defence of the country, and to consider of such further measures as might be necessary to make that defence more complete. He saw many gentlemen on the other side of the house who had thought it most necessary to review the system of defence in the last session. He would ask those gentlemen, how they could think such a review necessary then, and not think it full as necessary now? He desired them to take the account as it stood then, and to consider in what respect the balance had been changed. It was necessary, to alter the state of the case, that some change should have taken place, either that the enemy's means of annoying us should have decreased, or that our \"relative strength should have increased more than theirs. It was necessary also, that this diminution of our danger should not be a temporary cessation, but that the cause of apprehension should have entirely passed away. In his opinion, no material change had taken place. It was true some addition had been made to our force, but if even a greater addition had been made that would not be sufficient. The general: state of our military establishment was what it would be necessary to inquire into, and what had been done under the late defence act, to give us those improvements which were so generally allowed to be wanting before. Those who had voted for a Committee of Inquiry on this subject before, and one in particular who had gone further than all the rest (the present Chancellor of the Exchequer), were, he thought, particularly called upon to support his motion. He should feel extreme surprise if they should resist it, and was at a loss to think what reason they could possibly offer for such a resistance, except, indeed, they were prepared to confess they were wrong in their opinions at that time; that the measures they arraigned at that time had merits which they did not then see; and that the measures they recommended had deficiencies of which they were not aware. Was the right hon. the Chancellor of the Exchequer, prepared to say, that the whole of the additions made to our military establishment were made by his present colleagues, whom he then592opposed; was he prepared to say, that the measures he then declared bad were now good, and that the men he then censured as incapable, were now most capable? Was he prepared to say to those men, \"your measures have been such, that if I had then the opinion of them which I have now, I would not have voted for the enquiry? Was he prepared to allow that every thing which had been done, and which was now available, was done by them? He was, indeed, himself prepared to allow, that the noble lord and his associates bad done much more than had been done since; but, as his opinion was not changed as to the positive defects of what they had done, he still continued of opinion that the inquiry was necessary; and he thought those who voted for it on the former occasion, could not do otherwise than support his motion now. If it was meant to be argued, that men were procured by the measures ultimately adopted by the late administration, and then in progress, he had never denied that the system of raising men for rank would procure men. He was ready to allow the force of family influence in Ireland and Scotland, but he contended that the principle of a system of recruiting by influence was injurious. It was not to be denied that the presumptive heir to an estate might raise money on an annuity, but such would be ruinous to him. The measure of recruiting for rank was one which he always objected to, not that he denied its power of raising men, but that he thought it a most pernicious mode of obtaining them. Thus the ballot obtained men of necessity, and a considerable force, almost all that had been obtained to meet the extraordinary exigency,. had been supplied by it, under the direction of the late ministers, so that whatever obligations the right hon. gent. opposite owed to it, he was indebted for to them; yet, whatever it had produced, could not reconcile him to the principle, any more than if the parish bill itself had produced men. He therefore saw nothing to diminish the necessity of enquiry. Alt the former objections to the state of our military establishment were still in full force; and he knew not how, after the failure of the measure proposed as a remedy, any member who voted for inquiry then, could avoid voting for it now. This, however, was a mereargumentum ad homines;for though a large part of the house, notwithstanding it was a, minority593then, had supported that proposition, he should not think it necessary on that ground alone, that they should support him. Men should be determined always by the evidence before them; many of the measures thus instituted had by this time been brought to trial; some might have justified themselves by their success; others had been decidedly condemned by their failure. The very circumstance of a Spanish war changed the situation of the country. But that was not all. It might have been said by the late ministers and their adherents, that the regiments raising in England and Scotland promised to be successful; that some of their other measures also had procured men, and that the army of reserve though suspended, had been amply successful, and might again be revived, and that a further trial of all their measures would prove the efficacy of them. To those who voted for inquiry against those ministers, he would submit a broad question as to the necessity of enquiring now. Whether the present state of this country, (not meaning by the present state the bare condition of the moment, but as far as the view could reach,) was not a consideration of more vital importance than had ever been before kuown? Whether an army was not necessary, not merely to enable this country to rank among the nations, not only to preserve her power, her distant colonies, and the other sources of her consideration, but even to preserve herself from year to year? Whether our situation was not like that of the feudal times, when a man was obliged to sleep with Ins sword under his pillow, and when he was under the necessity of keeping his armour by him even while at the plough? All that we saw around us abroad, all the domestic occurrences that had taken place here, all the military discussions that had taken place in that house, the result of which had been the turning out of the last ministers and the coming in of the present, which had turned our chancellors of the exchequer, and our attornies and solicitors general into colonels and generals, and which had rendered all the men in the country military, all this proved the extraordinary and imperious necessity for a great and permanent military force. The next question was, whether we had, or were soon likely to have such an army, as was necessary for an immediate exigency? The third question would be, whether our military system was commodious and well594constructed, so as to answer the public exigencies in the best manner; so as to yield the best possible force, or a force in some measure adequate to the expence and exertions of the country? Fourthly, supposing it answered all these requisites, had it that facility of recruiting so as that it could exist long and support itself without any new or extraordinary aid? Could these questions be answered, unless the state \"of the country was different from that which he described it; unless we could soon have an establishment adequate to the exigency; unless the description of the force was good and in proportion to the expence we had been at, and the exertions we had made; unless it could be recruited and kept up so as to secure it from decay? Unless perfect and complete satisfaction could be given on all these points, there was a positive and undiminished necessity for the inquiry. We were told of the force of the volunteers, the militia, the army of reserve, and the regulars. One great objection to such a military establishment was its variety. It was not that there were light troops, and heavy troops, troops of the line, and troops on horseback, infantry on foot, or volunteers in carts; they might all have their particular services. What he objected to was their being on different establishments. Variety in nature might be very pleasing, but he did not think that was altogether the case in military establishments. If the volunteer system was good, why had we not all volunteers? If the army of reserve was good, why not make our whole force an army of reserve? But, perhaps, it might be said, they were for home service, and that it was necessary to have one sort of troops for one service, and one sort for another, like the man who had a great hole for his great cat, and a little hole for his little cat. He thought it better, before he proceeded, to examine the constitution of those four different armies; how far they were consistent with economy; how far they gave the greatest and best force; how far they interfered with each other; how far they counteracted the. general means i of recruiting; and how far they were the basis of a permanent force, First, as to the volunteers: this was a. head of defence which had already undergone so much discussion, that he wished he could pass over it without saying any thing now, But he could not help saying, that all his former opinions were confirmed by595the additional experience he had had since be expressed them. They were further confirmed by the testimonies of the best authorities; and here he hoped it would be hardly necessary for him to say, that he meant not the slightest reflection on those who composed the volunteer corps, who were ready to do any thing that was pointed out to them;. who had taken great trouble to do what they were directed to do, under this system, and if they had not done what was best, it was not their faults. The volunteer system had many defects in every view, political, civil, and military. If the volunteers were designed to answer a sudden emergency, it was a misfortune that they were not left to accomplish their natural purpose in their natural state. He could not help thinking that some things had already taken place, which might be considered as indices of what would probably take place in consequence of the prolonged existence of the volunteer system. The country had not yet seen the volunteers, either under the circumstances of a general election, or a general scarcity With respect to the second point, that was by far of more consequence. He considered the volunteer system as altering the civil character of the people of the country. As to the civil character, he apprehended a general effect on the manners and habits of men, such as would be much to be lamented. It tended to disturb the general relations of civil life, to fill those who belonged to it with vain and extravagant pretensions, to bring down the high and to exalt the low. Though he was far from wishing for a revival of those aristocratic notions which induced men of high rank to look down on others with disdain, yet he was a friend to that respect which belonged to persons in the several ranks and gradations of life. History had a story of a prince who had a man to go before him, to remind him that be was a man, lest he should forget he was one; and many political writers thought it a great advantage in our constitution, that our popular elections brought the great occasionally to sue to the humble, But extreme distinctions were not the vice of the present time. The vice was, if any thing, the other way. The toe of the peasant came too near the heel of the courtier. When committees of volunteers had the power of giving votes of praise and censure to those of the highest ranks, he thought a door was opened for much injury to society in a quarter where it was least apprehended. There was not a people in the world dis-596posed to shew more respect to the superior classes than the people of England; he meant a dignified respect, having nothing slavish in it, a homage to imputed virtues. If these virtues were not equal to the credit given them, the fault was in those who were supposed to possess them, and the respect that was shewn on the belief of their existence, was not less honourable to those who paid it hen. as to the effect of the volunteer force on the army; he did not think it could be the object of any considerable degree of confidence. If some battalions were equal to regular soldiers, and others were not so, it would be impossible to know when they were to be depended upon and when they were not. It was like those books of travels in which truth and falsehood were so-mixed, it was impossible to distinguish what was true. To those who argued that the volunteers were better materials of defence, disciplined as they were, he answered so was a pistol a more effectual weapon than a bludgeon, but if the lock was out of order and the powder bad, the bludgeon was unquestionably better. It was; absurd to suppose, that putting men in red coats and grenadiers caps, was sufficient to make an army. We were told every day of the volunteers being so well trained, of their dressing, marching, exercising, man&#x0153;uvring, and looking in every respect like regular soldiers; but that was not enough to make them regular soldiers. Nothing was more like a man than a picture; yet it was not a man. He had heard of a celebrated painter who painted grapes so well, that the birds came and pecked them, but they found they were not grapes. It was not the right way to judge of things by appearances. So to judge was to view with the eye of a child, that mistook painted devils for real ones. It was impossible to make an army out of a painted army, or what merely looked like an army. It was not men that made an army, but discipline. Discipline was the very life and soul of an army. You might as well suppose, that flour and eggs and butter and plums, would make a plum-pudding, as that men alone would make an army. The action of the fire and water was necessary to make, the excellent production to which he had alluded; just so the action of discipline and subordination was necessary to the constitution of an army. He had read in a well-known weekly publication (Political Register, Vol. 7. p. 193) a. letter which the writer had done him the honour to address to him from Edinburgh597abounding in true philosophy and plain sense, professing to be a summary of those opinions which himself and others, his friends, entertained on the subject of our national defence; but the letter stated these matters in a style superior to what he could aspire at compassing. He thought it worthy the perusal of every gentleman who heard him. If the volunteer force had, in the first instance, been only intended as a manifestation of the public feeling, that service had already been performed. A system built on zeal alone, was not built for perpetuity. It was like a fine theatrical position, which could not be preserved beyond a certain moment, and if the curtain did not drop, the arms must fall. The men would fall back into their natural station. By bounties and threats an effort may be made to draw them forth into battalions. The government may shake their parchments at them to drive them back again into these battalions, as it had done at first to drive them forward. A bill may be passed to render the volunteers more voluntary, and to make them permanent they may be constituted into a little militia. It was said, in accounting for the thinness of the musters, that those who absented themselves from drill had learned all that was necessary. Those who were most diligent, being of course soonest perfected, if they absented themselves as soon as complete, those who remained, in their absence must be a mere aukward squad; and when all were completed, there would be none in attendance. There were certainly some-things, such as swimming, which if once, learned were never forgot; military discipline was not of that number, it required continued exercise to preserve it. From these considerations, he could not agree that the volunteer system had done any great good; or that it was calculated to do any; but least of all, that it was to be looked up to as a part of our military establishment. Next as to the Militia, which he would describe in two words, by allowing that it was as good a force as it could possibly be, and that it went far beyond the designs and expectations that were formed of it at its institution. It had attained the highest perfection it could possibly reach, but the vicious principle of the ballot on which it was founded, had the most pernicious effects on the means of supplying our general military system. There were but two ways of supplying an army, by voluntary services and by compulsion. The armies of598most other countries, he believed, in some measure, of all, were how supplied be compulsion. France recruited her armies by conscription, he believed, not to the exclusion of volunteers; old France, he believed, recruited entirely by volunteer service; Russia recruited by compulsion; so did Sweden; Denmark in a great degree; Prussia altogether; and Austria chiefly by means not very remote from these; Britain raised its forces by volunteers alone, with the exception, of the train bands. The consideration of a bounty of one guinea, or a guinea and a half, could not have presented any inducement. The inducement was the state and condition of a soldier, and the bounty served only to wet the bargain. Here the right hon. gent. traced the history of the militia, from its institution in 1756, from the impulse of shame, at having Hessians and Hanoverians brought into the country to defend it. This was considered as a cheap force which would lie by in time of peace, and go to grass till it was wanted. Thus, being a force of a mixed description, it lost the advantages of both those between which it was intended as a mean. Our foreign and our home defence were intimately connected. The loss of its greatness would be to this country equivalent to the loss of its existence, for when it ceased to be great it would cease to be at all. There could be therefore no question of the legitimacy of the right of calling for and enforcing personal service, if there was a necessity of calling for it. It was not necessary, however, to have recourse to compulsion, and it was not legitimate as we could do without it. There were other measures more constitutional and more consistent with our former practice, which there was still room to hope might be successful. Such was the system that had existed before the ballot had been introduced, a poison that had of late spread so widely and been so destructive. This poison had long lain dormant. There was a spirit in the lower orders of the people, which would not for a time suffer the ballot to be enforced. From 1756 to 1774, the beginning of the American war, the ballot had never once been enforced, but in this period there was certainly included nine years of peace, from 1763 to 1774. At that time, there was no system of substitution, no bounties, growing out of it. From that time the increase of bounties commenced. The govt. was before the only bidder in the recruiting market, and599the recruit took the condition of a soldier, with a guinea to make it a wet bargain. Then the limit of time and of space in the obligation to find a substitute in one's own district, when the price was increased to govt. all over the country, in so much that ten guineas were given in the American war. Then a remedy was adopted similar to that which our farriers applied to horses legs, till the Veterinary College taught us better, giving temporary relief, but causing the complaint to relapse with increased force. Thus our state farriers, when the amount of the militia rendered the regular recruiting so dear, expected to relieve us by giving us more militia. In 1772 officers were threatened to be dismissed the service if they gave so much as two guineas bounty. In 1782,after its vast rise in the American war, it was again reduced to 3&#x00BD;, and the whole of that was not given in money. In the following war, when the militia was formed as it were into a regular army, and few served, who were not substitutes, the bounties became enormously high. Then came the pernicious system of raising men for rank, by which men who were only cornets, and even men who had never been in the army, were made colonels. In raising men the bounties had been brought to such an excess that it was necessary to threaten with dismissal those who gave more than 15 guineas. Then the Scotch and Irish militia were instituted and the latter was carried to the amount of 28,000. Next came the supplementary militia, and afterwards the provisional cavalry. This last was a thing of so short a duration, that it had slipped his memory at first, but it had left effects not to be forgotten. It passed over the country like a blight. It was like a hustle at a fair, which one got through in a moment, and did not think of it afterwards, till he found he had lost his watch. It was a pleasant conceit, to make every man ride another man's horse, till at length, when the men and horses were all brought together, no man knew how to mount, and so they all separated. From the effects of all these proceedings, the bounty was raised to 60 or 70, or even 80 guineas, and there was no reliance for an adequate and permanent supply after all. Then the establishment of the militia and army of reserve to the amount of 140,000 men, entirely choked the regular and ordinary sources. It was an hon. colonel who was now absent, (Colonel Craufurd), and other gentlemen at that side of the house, who had given its600beneficial qualities to this Army of Reserve. Act, so that whatever effect it had came from that side of the house, and he at his friends might say, like critic Dennis, \"that is my thunder.\" Thus he had traced the mischief down from the American war. The ballot was a principle which must of necessity exhaust itself, and it must have been exhausted where a measure which was calculated to produce 50,000 men, could by no possibility be made to produce more than 37,000. Applying it further was like giving physic to a man whose stomach would not hold it, and who immediately vomited it off. The ministers who had acted upon it till it stopped, were not, however to be blamed. They had only tried a known and established principle as far as it could go,. Having made the peace of Amiens, having suffered Bonaparte to overrun the Continent, and having made war when this' country could be nothing but a besieged island, that minister had recourse to this measure as the bow of Ulysses, which he made such use of that Adam Bell, and the other celebrated archers of old, were nothing to him. At length the force was so spent, that nothing more could be done, and as soon as this great archer fired the arrow, it fell at his feet. The friends of the noble lord (Sidmouth), t however, criedvictoria.They did not consider it, in the language of the turf, as a race won by a neck, though it seemed it was neck or nothing with him. The rider was thrown, and the horse came in. The noble lord called upon the clerk of the course to give judgment for him; but the person who held the stakes was called upon to give them into his hands; and having in the mean time been given into other hands, with a view to a different system, the noble lord now demanded them back, and was not satisfied to have them by halves.&#x2014;Here the right hon. gent, gave many forcible illustrations of the absurdity of recruiting the army by the circuitous means of the army of reserve. The army of reserve supplied many recruits, because it absorbed all the men of the country, and, the additional bounties induced men to go the circuitous route into the army. To praise it on this account was just the same as if, because all the members of the house came into it through the lobby, it should be said, what a wonderful place this lobby is, which supplies the house with all its members. It was a kind of turnpike where soldiers did not pay, but were paid for passing601through it. A man would be thought rather foolish not to go into the lobby first, by which he was able to get a double bounty before he became a regular soldier. He hoped to hear no more of the good effects of this lobby. The whole system was encumbered and weighed down with a complication of machinery. The existing bill was a sort of great digester, supplied with almost innumerable small capillary tubes, one running to every parish in the kingdom. Why not have a large straight pipe, making a direct communication at once, and free from the confusion of useless intricacies? But then he should be told, oh, there is no invention, no contrivance in all that! It was much easier, in those gentlemen's eyes, to take a circuitous mode of filling the great machine, than to throw all the materials into it at once, in a straight forward way. Gentlemen had talked about the bill not being oppressive; the oppression was not upon the recruit, but it was pretty heavy upon the parish. The parish was to do the work, after the old saying: \"fire burn stick, stick beat dog,\" and so on. The parish officers over whom the parish had no controul, were to raise the men or levy the money from the parish; but that could no more have the effect of finding the men, than one could make the horse drink though he should take him to the water. It was, however, now given up. It was like a man of whom nobody spoke well, and of whom therefore it was unnecessary to speak ill. It was like harlequin's horse, which had but one fault, and that was, that it was dead. It, was perhaps, unnecessary to follow it further, unless, indeed, the humane society may not have yet done with it, and the right lion. gent. opposite may hope to revive it by some process. If, however, the right hon. gent, would content himself with saying merely that it deserved to be revived, he would be satisfied. It was said the present measure (the additional force act), had not been successful, because the parish officers did not understand it so as to proceed to enforce it immediately. If it lay six weeks in their hands before they could understand it, much could not be expected from their sense of their duty under it. The bill passed on the 23d of June, and nothing was heard of it till the 13th of Aug. and then when it was supposed to be ready to go off like a spinning jenny, like the machinery of a thousand looms, not a sound was heard; it wasaltum silentium.In-602stead of all this, you went about as quietly as ever, and people in their disappointment were every where enquiring, \"where's the new parish bill?\" Wonderful, indeed, were the effects of this parish bill, that was to work with such unprecedented local efficacy, and which had produced, allowing for casualties and desertions, the astonishing number of 665 men! Yet this was the system which was immediately to produce all we wanted, and to afford a continued and full supply to 60 battalions. In what situation was the country, when the ballot failed altogether, and when no hope could be entertained of the measures brought forward to replace it? It was not only a present supply that we wanted, but the means of constantly keeping up that supply; 5000 men was the whole number obtained by the staff recruiting. The rest was obtained from sources reprobated, not as unproductive, but as unfit to have recourse to, as exhausting the permanent, hope like the savage who cut down the tree to get at the fruit. To pursue this system further, was to act like a man living on credit, and going on smoothly for a while, but who was obliged to shut his door as soon as the bills came in for payment. When were we to go back to the ballot? the gentleman who had tried it last had stuck to it while it could produce any thing; and now it was like a fallen minister, in company with whom nobody wished to be seen. The present measure had gone far beyond the ballot, except that the parish officers were not compelled to act, as it was not determined how we should proceed. They could not get the men, and ministers were afraid to take the money. It may perhaps be resolved to take it from two or three parishes, to quicken the others, by whipping them, just as the captain of a ship compelled the dropsical man to mount the mast, saying his complaint was but arising from indolence, till the fall of the poor man into the sea convinced him of the truth of his sickness by the loss of his life. Another complaint against this mode of recruiting was, that while it professed to keep the bounty below 201. the crimps who were generally employed, had the. 141. allowed by government, in addition to the 20l. making altogether 34l. for every man. Thus ingenuity came at length in aid of the parish officers, and obtained some men at an increased bounty. He therefore considered the experiment as haying completely failed; and here he might say, what he603was sure the house would be glad to hear, that his task was nearly at an end. He had shewn, that as a means of improving cur military system, this measure was abortive. In nine months an increase of 11,000 had beep made. In the same period the losses at home and abroad amounted to 16,000. Both these making 27,000 ought, and must have been supplied by other means, if these had not been resorted to. And if, on the whole, the increase had been equal to both these 15 or 16,000, it would have been for the consumption alone, all the rest would be derived from foreign sources. Thus it appeared, that only 5000 men had been gained for the general service in the first instance, and the remainder of the increase by measures which the hon. gent. had reprobated, so that only one-third of the increase had been supplied by the means that had been employed. Some small addition had been made to the cavalry, but when it was considered how favourite a service that was, the supply was by no means such as it ought to be under proper encouragement. If the troops employed on colonial service, which were all set fast to answer the local demands, and could not be detached, except, perhaps, en small expeditions, for no man could suppose that the troops in garrison at Gibraltar, &c.; would be safely employed in that way, all the regular infantry we had to dispose of, amounted only to 53,000 men; and, indeed, if we took off the amount of foreigners, we should find it to be only 47,000 British infantry. This was all we had for any important and unexpected demand whatever, whether it were at home, or for any effort in any great continental operation that might be undertaken. As for the Foreign troops, it was, doubtless, very proper to have them in our pay; but one could not help being struck a little with the character of these foreign troops. Soldiers of this description were generally supposed to be for general and unlimited service, ready to go any where. But a greater part of them were Canadian Fencibies, and New Brunswick fencibles. The house would, however, think it odd that in these foreign corps were included 4 or 5,000 native troops of Ceylon, armed, he supposed, with bows and arrows, From what he had stated, it would be evident, that something more than the present measures was necessary to fill the' vast vacancy in the army, and after having shewn what604were our military prospects, he was satisfied that every body would agree in the necessity of resorting to the wisdom parliament, for that something that was necessary to be done. In saying that it would be right to resort to the wisdom of parliament, no man, of course, could be supposed to mean his own wisdom; but the more he felt himself incapable, and the more he looked to others, as more competent to point out the measures that ought to be adopted, the more necessary it was to resort to the wisdom of parliament, and of the nation. As, however, in the event of his motion being agreed to, he should feel it his duty to submit his sentiments on the subject in the committee which it was his intention to propose, he thought it would not be altogether out of place to stats summarily the particular objects to which his observations would apply. And here he begged to disclaim all systems, his object being only to remove the obstructions which at present interfered with the regular supply of the army, and to restore our military establishment to the old way of recruiting it. He had already shewn from experience the ruinous effects of the system of ballot, that had first created, and afterwards continued, the difficulties in keeping up the numbers of the army; and he was confident that the fault was with the government. Wherever difficulties and impediments were felt in any branch of the public service, it was a priori to be inferred, that the fault lay with the government. He was aware, however, that no minister could, as had been boasted by Pompey the Great, raiset in army by stamping his foot on the floor. The creation of an army would be a work of time. He was not, however, one of those who were apt to run into the opinion, that every thing that was wrong must result from the fault of government. The question might be divided into two parts, with respect to an army within our power to have, and out of our power to have. For any purpose that we wanted, he was happy to think, that an army was completely in our own power. An army-might undoubtedly be carried too far, as well as neglected too much, and not carried far enough; but what was there to hinder us, with our population, from making a proper army? What was to prevent us from turning a certain proportion of our population towards the military profession, as well as towards any other of605the professions, or any particular trade? Why could not the army be made to feel that it was equally worth their while to go to that profession, as to go to a trade? Make it an object with men to enter into the profession, and enough will be induced to join it, Suppose any new manufacture of great importance, some great cotton manufacture for instance, suddenly sprung up and flourished; some other trades and manufactures were probably at first hurt by its prosperity; but these things found their own level. There was a new means of subsistence discovered. Mr. Mai thus had not, indeed, discovered any new principle, for the principle was obvious before; but he had pursued it with great perspicuity and truth. The demand will have its relation to the supply. For instance, if shoes took twice their quantity of materials, if men had four legs instead of two, or even supposing they had as many legs as a caterpillar, shoes must still be worn; what was there then in the trade of a soldier so exceedingly forbidding and revolting to the people of this country? A soldier was not quite sure of a very long life, but his occupation was more healthy than most others. People were found everyday to go down into damp, unhealthy mines in Cornwall and Derbyshire; we had painters, and other tradesmen following unhealthy pursuits; nothing was wanting but to put the soldier's trade upon a proper level. The army had great attractions to the young and ardent and high-spirited. Notwithstanding all seeming disadvantages, there was an invincible attachment to a military life to be found, by no means uncommon. But when he spoke of the trade, he might also speak of the trader. The military life was the trade; the trader was the government. Could not this great trader do as much as other traders do, to put this particular trade on as high a ground at least as any other of the profitable pursuits of mankind? Could government fear any competition on such a subject? They could grant privileges, they could bestow immunities, they could confer distinctions. We know very well that in some other countries the force of certain religious opinions have been such as would either entirely prevent or else impair the formation of an army. Thus, in some parts of Asia there were people that could not be brought to military pursuits. So the numerous body of Quakers (could not be persuaded to throw off their religious opi-606nions on this point. We find no such prejudices operating generally among us; but would any body say, that we were become so unmartial and so effeminate as to be past the age of military glory, in the history of this country? Why were our ships manned without fear of storms, or wrecks, or enemies? If we had not an army it was entirely our own fault. Ministers had sometimes laid the fault of bad systems upon the heads of their predecessors; but what excuse of this kind could be made where a minister had been his own predecessor?&#x2014;Now, the first thing he should propose, would unquestionably be to clear away all the obstructions that stood in the way of getting an army. To the system of ballot he certainly objected, though he would not at once do it totally away in the case of the militia. He had been misrepresented as the enemy of the militia, which he had never been. He did not like to see it extended too far beyond the original object, and clogging the regular army. He considered the manner in which the militia was broken in upon some years back, as the most injurious mode of meddling with that establishment, and as one which could only be justified by an immediate emergency. Some gentlemen who held commissions in the militia, fancied they had the militia under the protection of the chancellor of exchequer; but he would tell them, that they had put their lamb under the butcher's protection; and, if they pleased, he would tell the militia colonels how long it would be safe. It would be safe just as long as they themselves had power and numbers enough in parliament to protect it. &#x2014;The right hon. gent. then dwelt at considerable length on the improper profusion of military honours. Military distinctions, he said, were scattered about over the land, with a profuse and in discriminating liberality. He here again referred to the letter from Edinburgh, addressed to him, and published, which contained some excellent observations on this head, written too, in a part of the island, where he had good reason to believe the volunteers were the most perfect. It was odd, that while all other, characteristic honours are sparingly diffused and cherily kept, and whils they sustained their importance by their rarity they should be so profuse and unbounded in their relations to a profession which, is most particular about its honour and its glory and which seeks, 'the bubble reputation, e'en in the cannon's mouth.607Why should there be this strange, and seemingly unaccountable difference? Did gentlemen imagine that the estimation of any other honour would long hold its place if treated with any thing like such indifference? Independently of the impolicy of thus making common the military rank, he would put it to the feelings of gentlemen, whether it was treating military men with any degree of fairness, to lessen the value of that which formed the most grateful reward of a soldier's ambition, and enabled him to support the greatest variety of fatigue and danger? From the very nature of man, such a conduct must have an ill effect. By taking away the importance of the military distinction, all the -association of glorious and animating ideas connected with it were likely to be lost, and the public as well as the individual deference attached to it must soon disappear. Many other distinctions might be mere nullities. A man might be advanced to the peerage without any Claim to merit. Certainly the possession of a title of that nature did not imply any: but the military distinction was of intrinsic value, particularly because it implied intrinsic merit. If, said the right hon. gent. you destroy the peculiarity of the symbol, you take away the fairest portion of its value. If you, by your indiscriminate use of a distinction, take from the soldier the fruit of what he has earned by a life of military activity and the arduous exertions of a long and well-fought field, you must, beyond calculation, destroy the spirit of an army, and that high-minded ardour of military life, which has so justly been called the \"cheap defence of nations.\" Now, sir, in this, as in other matter, I say, go back to simplicity in your theory and practice. Get rid of the incumbrances and obstructions of your system. Clear away all the brush-wood, and brambles, and moss, and ivy, and let the tree have the full benefit of the air and the light of heaven.&#x2014;That was what it wanted to invigorate its growth, and without that it could not prosper. We required an army for our defence, not a thing decked out in gaudy trappings that was merely an army to look at. To acquire such an army, nobody could say that much was not to be done, and nobody would say that much ought not to be done. In order to attain these objects, and to procure men, he would propose, as the most essential improvement, an alteration in the time of service. That improvement adopt-608ed, there were various other regulations which he would take occasion to submit, and particularly one with respect to the condition of the inferior officers of the army, whose pay was at present extremely inadequate. This was a point that, in a country like ours, where money was in a great degree the criterion of consequence, was highly deserving the attention of the house. It was notoriously impossible for military officers of inferior rank to subsist upon their present allowance. How, then, could the military character sustain itself and be held in proper estimation, if military men were driven, as too many of them unfortunately were, to all the shifts consequent upon poverty; if they were, as was frequently the case, driven from the army altogether, to perish in a jail? That such consequences must have a most injurious effect upon the army, he thought could not be doubted for a moment; and the causes of the evil must be removed, before an efficient army could be had. If it was desired to raise and maintain an army, it was peculiarly necessary to raise the pay of the inferior officers, so as to enable them to maintain themselves like gentlemen. How galling must it be to them, to see themselves surrounded with holiday soldiers, who could afford all the enjoyments of life, and who outshine them in military splendor.&#x2014;The next improvement he would recommend would be a formal, solid, and absolute renunciation of the practice of drafting. This practice he had ever deemed improper and mischievous, and a great aggravation of the other evils which existed in the military system. By abolishing the draft, and changing the term of service, he sincerely believed that two of the most serious objections which the people felt against enlisting into the regular army would be done away. If this mode of recruiting was adopted, he thought the country would never want real soldiers, and therefore would not be reduced to the necessity of placing much dependance on any other. He would also suggest some regulations relative to our force in the West India Islands. The horror felt respecting that service would be set aside in part by the abolition of the draft, and of course one of the great obstructions to recruiting would be removed. It was well known that, among the common people and the soldiery, nothing excited more dread than the idea of a draft to the West Indies; for it was not the men going609to share danger with their officers, but going without their officers, and the mischief was to that place. which they deemed \"the bourne from whence no traveller returns.\" &#x2014;Into a detail of the regulations which he thought necessary with respect to our West India service he did not feel it proper to enter. He should merely say, that such European troops as it might be expedient to send to those colonies, he would not send without a gradual preparation for the climate. This preparation to take place by transferring the men in a sort of succession from one spot more congenial to the constitutions of Europeans to one less so. For instance, he would first send them to the island of Bermudas, or the Bahamas, and having remained there some time, they might be safely conveyed in rotation to those islands where the climate was wanner. The advantage of this arrangement, as the house must conceive, would be to fit the men to endure that climate, which had been heretofore so great a drain on our population. This drain he always understood to be aggravated by the practices to which the drafts generally resorted on their arrival in the islands. If they did not suffer from the common effects of the climate, they either fell victims to despair, or got into habits of intoxication which speedily produced their death. This furnished another reason for the abolition of drafting, and the adoption of the plan of preparation lie had sketched to the house.&#x2014;Another head of reform which the right hon. gent. strongly felt it his duty to bring forward, would be the abolition pf corporal punishment, unless for acknowledged and specified crimes. Such punishments, he agreed with the correspondent he before alluded to, were by much too frequent and, too severe in the army. There were many means of correcting a soldier without resorting to them. Any offence that shame, fine, or imprisonment was adequate to punish, ought not to be the subject of corporal punishment. So much severity as was known to prevail was the more to be deplored, because it, was not necessary to the preservation of discipline. Discipline, if it be properly managed, will, like a machine well contrived and set together, move on with the less force. It is generally owing to some great fault in the original structure, or some great mismanagement and unsteadiness, in those to whom the machine of discipline is committed, that these excessive severities are at all610had recourse to. The reform which was so desirable on this point could not, he was aware, be effected, without a material change in the construction and conduct of courts martial. They must be more solemn in their proceedings, more deliberate in their investigations, something must be contrived to intervene in all cases between, passion and its effects; some check on summary punishment must be provided; it must be settled that no corporal punishment shall take place, no sentence of that nature shall be executed, without previously submitting the proceedings of the court martial to the review of the commander in chief. This last provision would, he was persuaded, have prodigious effect, particularly if combined with, a specific description of the crimes for which a soldier should be subject to corporal punishment. To such a description he could not conceive that any objection could be made. Certainly on the score of justice and humanity, it was much fairer that such a description should be promulgated, for the government of both officer and soldier, than that the latter should be left entirely to the mercy of whatever conception of crime the former might happen to entertain. He cared not how voluminous, this description of crimes might be, all he wanted was, that the soldier might know what was really to be deemed criminal. The penal code of this country, although death was almost in every line, did not terrify the great mass of the people, because it referred to such crimes as no proper man would commit; nor would a precise description of the crimes to which corporal punishment should attach in the army, have the effect of preventing men from entering into or remaining in it; but quite the contrary.&#x2014;The soldier will not be afraid of that which no good soldier will deserve: but it would certainly be a considerable alleviation to a soldier's mind to be always able to say, \"If I go to parade with a button off my coat, or happen to be a minute or two too late, I shall not be in danger of being tried by a court martial, or of suffering any immediate punishment that is degrading to the feelings and spirit of a soldier.\" It was in these small intermediate points of duty, that were of but little consequence in themselves comparatively speaking, that he thought punishments might be modified, and alleviated, with the greatest and happiest effect.&#x2014;He then adverted to certain, in-611centives, which he thought might be applied with considerable propriety and effect, in stimulating soldiers to a keener and more active sense of their duty. The profession of a soldier was such as exposed him to the most imminent danger, and he who had any apprehension of that, was not fit for the profession, nor should ever think of entering into it. He allowed, that, circumstanced as this country now is, it is impossible to increase the pay of the army; in that respect, we had unfortunately arrived at thene plus ultra.But was there nothing else, he asked, could be found worthy to be substituted as an equivalent to an additional 5d. or 6d. a day? was there no such thing as contriving to put by part of the bounty, to be paid on the expiration of the service, instead of the beginning, as a stimulus to the valuable and true soldier, and to operate as a reward to his family, in case any accident should happen to him. The bounty, he said, generally acted both ways, and he feared there was not above one man in eight, or at most in seven, that really deserved it. But there were other things, which operated as incentives, as powerfully, or perhaps more so, than money. Suppose we should give him a right to vote in particular cases, or even suppose we should go still further, and allow him to kill game, for instance, as a stimulus to be a true soldier, and thereby deserve preferment; suppose a serjeaut should be allowed to kill game? This would be no unprecedented method of holding forth inducements independent of pay. In France the soldier was always, during the ancient govt. entitled to a particular row in the theatre. Was it not to be supposed, he asked, that such grants or remunerations as those he had mentioned, would operate in this country as they had done in others, and not only be a means of drawing men into the army, but of making them good and attentive to their duty, while, they were in it? For his own part, he could not entertain the most distant doubt of it.&#x2014;It now remained only for him to touch as briefly as possible on the several objections which might, perhaps, be made to these different alterations and points of reform, which he had taken the liberty to suggest to the house, as applicable to the present state of the forces, and the peculiar circumstances of the country at the present moment. One of those was that this change will require time,612and that at present we have none to spare. This was an old argument, he said, but it weighed very little with him. In order to act as we ought to do, we must boldly look our situation in the face. If bad measures were allowed to go on because the time was too pressing to consider of their removal, the time would at length become pressing, because the measures were bad. We should be found, according to this argument, to be in the same situation with the hare that is hard pressed by the greyhound; she must go on because she has not time to turn, and yet in turning lies her only safety, for if she persists in going forward, she is sure to fall a sacrifice. Such, said the right hon. gent, will precisely be the situation of this country, if we blindly and obstinately persist in pursuing the same measures as have led us into our present unfortunate circumstances. Can any one, he asked, pretend to flatter himself that the danger we had to dread is over, and has passed away? Me cautioned the house to beware how they suffered themselves to be deluded by such an idea. If, therefore, that should be allowed, and it should be granted that it was still hanging over us, then he contended, there was no time like the present; we had not a moment to lose, and, our greatest safety lay in looking the danger boldly in the face, and endeavouring to avert it by an immediate adoption of measures different to those which had been proved to be so imbecile in themselves, and so totally contrary to the ends and purposes for which they had originally been intended.&#x2014;The right hon. gent, again repeated his opinion, that without changing the term of military service, the army would never become so efficient as was to be wished. It was the general sentiment, the growing feeling of the country, that to enlist for a term of years would be far preferable to the present unlimited period of enlistment. Against adopting this plan, indeed, he had never heard any rational objection. He had heard something of authority, but nothing at all of argument. No argument could, he contended, be drawn against this project from the limited experiment which was alleged to have been made. In order to ascertain the efficacy of this plan, it must at once be rendered general. There were some things which ought to. be proceeded in progressively; one iron might be hot while the other was cold; but the plan he now proposed was not at that description613it must not be executed slowly or partially, it must be promptly and universally set in motion, or it was one of those things in which the fire would go out, and the iron grow cold. If in addition to this change, that of abolishing the draft were acceded to, he should entertain the best prospect of the speedy advancement of the army. On the abolition of the draft, he would advise the grafting of another regulation, namely, that men who after serving the first term, suppose seven years, would agree to enlist again, should have some marked additional privilege. To those who observed that the limitation of time he mentioned would have an injurious effect on discipline, he should only think it necessary to say, that as a soldier was liable to punishment if he committed a fault only the moment before his time of service expired, he could not conceive that such an effect was possible. If, however, suclvan effect were likely to arise, how happened it to our Army of Reserve and our Militia? It was to be observed, too, that very good discipline prevailed in the armies of Austria and Prussia, among whom enlistment for a term of years was universal. By what contrivance then could men be seduced? By what artifice could they be duped to attend to the notion that this term of enlistment would induce desertion? A contrary consequence was, in his judgment, to be looked for; but if a man should desert, let him be obliged to serve for two of the ordinary terms, or during his life. From some officers who had travelled in Germany, he understood that it was extremely difficult to persuade the soldiery to desert, because, as they said, the term of their enlistment was soon to expire. Why should not a. similar reflection produce a similar unwillingness to desert among the soldiers of this country, if the same plan of enlistment were adopted? The parish bill, he was persuaded, would have gone on better, if this term of enlistment had been promulgated, because the influence of the gentry would have been more cheerfully employed to induce men to enlist, if they had been aware that the men were only to serve for a limited time.&#x2014;That reasons could be urged against the propriety of considering of some means to augment our regular army, which was the object of his motion, he was and a loss to imagine. It was confessed, that all the ordinary means of recruiting were at a stop, and that the614parish bill had failed. With this confession before the house, how could, resistance to the motion he had to submit be justified? He recommended the adoption of a few plain principles, which must tend to increase the consequence and comforts, and of course the numbers of the army. Several expedients had been tried, and all, including the parish bill, had notoriously failed. He trusted that all gentlemen who had these failures in their recollection, would join with him in endeavouring to devise the means of rescuing the army from that ill-judged and mischievous system in which it was involved by those who had had the management of it for the last 30 years. Now that necessity so imperiously called for the revision of this system, he hoped that it would not be objected to.&#x2014;With respect to the foreign corps in our service, in the present state of the country he approved of the existence of that body, and if we could combine with it a strong disposable force of our own troops, he thought we should not be obliged long to withdraw ourselves from the continent, nor to shut ourselves up like a, tortoise in its shell. This shutting ourselves up so long, he considered one of our greatest misfortunes. He hoped we should hear no more of the fantastical doctrine that \"we were a people too honest for continental connections.\" We had appeared to withdraw ourselves so much from even the feelings of the continent, that Europe might fairly say, that while we were engaged in our commercial pursuits and in collecting wealth, we were offering them money to fight for us. As he considered the state of our army to be that which had placed us in that situation, and that the increase and improvement of our army could alone bring us out of it, and that no time was to be lost in struggling to effect our release, he felt it his duty to move, \"That it be referred to a, committee to revise the several acts passed during the two last sessions of parliament, for the Defence of the Country, and to consider of such other measures as may be necessary to make that defence more complete and permanent.\" On the question, being put,", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-windham-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1805", "feb", "21"], "content": "said, however be might differ from the arguments and sentiments; that had been stated by his right hon. friend, he did not differ with him as to the grounds upon which he proposed the motion that had been just submitted to the615house. In adverting to those arguments, he should abstain from having recourse to those common places which his right hon. friend had deprecated; as he should not be disposed to dispute the propriety of the measure he proposed for a parliamentary inquiry, if the case existed which he supposed, either that government had not done any thing, or very little for the defence of the country, and the improvement of its military means. In those principles he agreed; he only differed in the application. Before he should proceed, however, it was necessary to set himself light with his right hon. friend, because of the indignation and astonishment which he supposed him prepared to feel, on finding any person declare himself an advocate for the bill of last session. He was prepared to justify that measure, though he should not contend that it had succeeded to the full extent that had been expected; but this was not the proper time to pronounce to what degree it had failed. He begged to remind his right hon. friend that the bill had two objects, one to raise a large present force, and the other to become the source of a permanent supply for the army. This latter object had not yet been tried, and until that should be done, it could not be fairly decided that the measure had failed. The latter object was by much the most important one, and that which had induced many gentlemen. who felt dissatisfied with some of the details of the measure, to agree to it. That part of it which related to the permanent force had not yet been tried, the measure having had its operation hitherto confined to raising the immediate force, and filling up those vacancies which previously existed. What then did he infer from this? That they should try the merits of the measure, not from its effect in the first case, but on its success with respect to the more important object. The operation of the bill commenced with filling up existing vacancies in districts that had been before ex-exhausted of means by the army of reserve and the militia, and, because it had not succeeded in such districts, he contended that it was not fair to conclude that it had failed in its diffusive operation all over the kingdom. He did not insist on this as a conclusive argument, but he looked upon it as a sufficient one against those who dwelt on the total and general failure of the measure. It had been urged that it neither had succeeded in filling up the va-616cancies, not in procuring a permanent supply for the army; but he should refer gentlemen to the effect of the measure which this had succeeded, and in whose place it stood, he meant the army of reserve, and they would find that it had yielded 10,000 men this year for the army. Did that prove that the hope of a supply from such a measure was visionary, and ought to be abandoned? Were there not other reasons also to shew that it ought not to be given up? When they looked to the circumstances of the country, exhausted of men by the army of reserve and the supplementary militia, there could be no surprise felt at this measure not having had immediate and complete success. There was another difficulty to its operation which had arisen from the opposition that had been made to the measure last session, and the report that an effort would be made to obtain the repeal of it early in the present. These circumstances had thrown a damp in a great measure on the zeal that would have been exerted in carrying provisions into effect, which might afterwards turn out to be nugatory. But it was not alone in this general principle that exertions were slackened, but experience also concurred to the same end. In execution of the army of reserve act, penalties had been incurred for deficiencies which had not been levied, and the parishes might have had an expectation of escaping in the same manner. Here there was an example of penalties incurred and not exacted, and the expectation of the repeal of the measure, though he could not allow the expectation to have been just; and he would ask any man, whether, with such expectations, there had been a fair chance for obtaining that exercise of zeal, of local influence, and personal exertion, whether the measure had had a fair trial, and whether the country did not require the defeat of the motion submitted that night, in order to give the measure a fair and impartial trial? Another reason his right hon. friend had assigned in support of his motion, was founded on the variety of opinions that had been stated in the different discussions on this subject in that house. Undoubtedly the public looked with considerable interest to the discussions in that house, and to the opinions urged in them, and to none with more respect than to those of his right hon. friend. But it was rather curious to make the number of va617rious opinions and various measures that had originated in that house, an argument for repealing this measure, in order to shew that they had come to some steady and consistent system at last. If the measure were even less unexceptionable than it really is, and not as likely to answer the end for which it was intended as he maintained it was, he insisted, that instead of repealing it, it ought to have a fair trial, and not precipitately, or prematurely, receive its condemnation. With respect to the merits of the bill, it appeared to him calculated to produce an effect which his right hon. friend had frequently dwelt on during last session, and had that night more particularly and directly adverted to. Let the army alone, said his right hon. friend, and it will get on. His right hon. friend would not deny that this measure had the merit of doing away the high bounties, of doing away the competition, especially as since the failure of the unhappy parish officers the men had been recruited by the regular officers of the crown. But his right hon. friend was hot to be satisfied with any mode of recruiting, unless it was conducted all in one way and for one description of force, for until he had reached nearly the end of his speech, the only inference that could be drawn from all the preceding points of it, was, that he would allow of no species of force but regulars. In the close of his speech however, he seemed to have kept one remnant for the militia. Had he not found to what purpose his right hon. friend had turned this concession by the appeal he bad made to the feelings of the militia colonels, he should have given him credit for an honourable and praiseworthy attachment to that constitutional force. Mad his right hon. friend recommended the extinction of the militia force, he could not have had the opportunity for his powerful appeal to the militia colonels; but in proposing to continue the militia on its original establishment of 40,000, and to raise that number still by the ballot, he seemed by his appeal to the colonels to have made his statement from his conclusions, not his conclusions from his statement. As to the argument of his right hon. friend, with respect to the policy of such a mixed force as that proposed to be raised by the bill, it appeared weak in principle, inconclusive in reasoning, and dangerous in tendency. If on the conclusion of war, our regular force were to be reduced to the618peace establishment, which alone the constitution of this free country could have sanctioned, he would ask his right hon. friend, how we were, on the breaking out of a fresh war, to raise such a force, as he was sure his right hon. friend would be as anxious to have as any other member of that house, a force capable of being employed with effect for the annoyance of the enemy? What alternative was there to chuse, but whether a large standing army should be kept up, or a force of the description of that proposed to be raised by this bill? Neither the country nor the house would consent to the former; and in proof of this, he could refer to those arguments that had been so frequently repeated in that house, of the danger of having the liberties and the constitution of the country subverted, by having a large standing army at the disposal of government. There was no alternative, therefore, but to obtain a force that might take the place of the army without offence to the constitution. Of such a force there were two descriptions: the militia, of which we had the experience of half a century, or such a force as should be limited in service like the militia, but being officered by regular officers should approach more nearly to the quality of regulars, and be a nursery for the supply of the army. He agreed that the militia ought not to be carried beyond a certain extent, not because it could not be kept up to that extent, but because it was ascertained, that it could not be maintained in that extent consistently with the principles of its original institution. If you vary from the original mode with respect to officers, you may vary still more, so as to render the force more perfect, and to bring it nearer to the discipline and condition of a regular force, which would be the same as a standing army.&#x2014;But his right hon. friend, after stating his objections to the bill, had proceeded to detail fairly the alterations and the improvements in the military system, which he proposed to submit to the committee. His leading principle of objection was to the variety of force on foot; but he could not himself-see on the face of it what objection there could be to variety. If a pure monarchy were to exist in any country with a population purely agricultural, unmixed with commercial pursuits, there would be no difficulty in obtaining a large army, augmentable and, reducible in a short pe-619riod. But the same does not take place in a country where manufactures and commerce have made extensive progress. Did it follow, he asked, that if we should not get the whole number we wanted in the way most desirable, that we should throw the remainder away as dross or useless? Did it follow, that because the whole number could not be procured of that description for which his right hon. friend had a great fondness and anxiety, that we should not march such a proportion of our population who might enter into the disposable force, whose absence would not be felt nor lamented, and leave the protection of their districts to those who remained in the more limited force. If the militia could be carried to the extent necessary, then his right hon. friend would obtain his object. But they had tried the militia, and had found it impossible to keep it to the extent to which it had been carried, consistently with the principles of its institution. Was there any thing absurd, surprising, or mischievous, in the arrangement for employing men whose occupations prevented them from engaging in the disposable force at home, and thereby setting free so much of the disposable force to be employed abroad? A great objection to this levy was, that it professed to raise the men first for limited service, and afterwards to leave them free to enter into the regulars. But if he understood right what his right hon. friend had urged, when the army of reserve act was under consideration, he had recommended to allow the men to enlist from it into the line. For himself he could not discover what the absurdity was in supposing that the men would be induced to enter for unlimited service in the first instance; and that afterwards, from the force of acquired habits, the influence of example, and attachment to their officers, they might be induced to take the second step. His right hon. friend had argued, that a limitation of time would operate as a strong temptation to them to enter even for general service, but was- not there equal reason to suppose, that a limitation of place would also operate as a temptation? He could not conceive why the first limitation should act as a direct temptation, and the other in the inverse ratio. If either was to have any effect, both combined must have a greater, for it could not be supposed that both together should fail when one was irresistible. With respect to the limitation620of the time of service, there were many different opinions; and he should not venture to hazard any, though he could not but admit, that it was a subject which would be productive of many difficulties in the detail in the committee. Any body might see that a great variety of difficulties would occur. If the change were to be made in time of war, and the condition to be extended to all at present serving, would not the offer be a boon to one, whilst it would be a mischief or a punishment to another? But should they begin from the present moment, how were they to proceed? were the new levies to be in corporated with the old battalions? what a source of disquietude, heart burnings, and dissatisfaction? were they to be disposed of in separate battalions? then they would come to the present bill, and do that precisely which it professed.&#x2014;He bad no hesitation in saying that the idea of a colonial army met his approbation, without exception even of the black corps. But any body who looked to the population of the colonies must perceive that it was impossible there to supply the army, and it would therefore be necessary to recruit in Europe. Mark the consequences of restricting the army from service in her colonies. Would the other powers of Europe follow the example? Supposing the army of St. Domingo to attack Jamaica, would it be wise to tie up the disposable force of this country in Europe, and suffer one of the most valuable of its possessions to be destroyed? As to the other parts of his right hon. friend's speech, without any intention of disrespect to him, he did not think them of much importance. Among the suggestions of his right hon. friend there were some, which among an enthusiastic and romantic people, might be very well received; but he would put it to the candour of his right hon. friend, whether if instead of the bill of last session it had been proposed by ministers, as an encouragement to enlisting, that soldiers, should have a box at the play, or serjeants should be allowed to shoot partridges, that right hon. gent, would have been inclined to treat the proposition as serious. If there was any thing like a contrary disposition on the part of ministers not to manifest a readiness to do every thing in their power for the national defence, or if there was any thing imminently dangerous in our situation, that called for the committee moved for by his right hon.621friend, then, indeed, there would be some I which we at present stood, and compared ground for acceding to it: but the case it with that of last year, to refrain from was quite otherwise. Perhaps it might be for the satisfaction of the house to slate a view of the whole military force of the country. The total of disposable force on the 1st of Jan. 1804, was 143,251; on the 1st of Jan. 1805, 154,660; the whole of our limited force on the former date, 27,890, on the latter, 20,747. Deducting the limited force, which was included in the former aggregates, the whole of the disposable force was, on the 1st of Jan. 1804, 115,000; on the 1st of Jan. 1805, 135,000, making an increase of disposable force of from 18,000 to 20,000 men. The quantity I procured by recruiting was from 24 to 26,000; and 15,000 since the operation of the present bill. The total of between 11 and 12,000 increase, is not only in the unlimited force, but in the destination of the army at home. This circumstance was sufficient shew the bill had not been idle and nugatory. Thus, 12,000 men were now ready to be ordered in any direction, in addition to the force provided; besides this, we had the essential improvement in the volunteers, which he could not agree to consider unconnected with the question on the extent of the military power of the country: their number now ascended to 300,000 men, who have stood the test of time, who have resisted the temptations to ease and indolence; and 160,000 of this vast body have been reported fit for service. He did not mean they were adequate to contend with the troops of Prussia or Austria, but that they were competent to the defence of such districts of the island as should be committed to their protection. Could we with such a force have any room for the gloomy representations frequently made? Could more be expected from the nature and extent of the population of the country? If we wish for a criterion by which to estimate the military force of the country, let us look to the state of the different powers on the continent, let us look particularly to France, which, with a population of 35 millions, had an army not exceeding at any time 5 or 600,000 men, while in G. Britain, which contained but 15 millions, the regular force amounted to three hundred thousand men, besides those to v whom the domestic defence was entrusted, as also 70,000 militia, and 300,000 volunteers. It was impossible for any men who fairly examined the situation in622which we at present stood, and compared it with that at last year, to refrain from allowing that it was greatly improved. Could such a man be found, he would ask him, was it nothing to have added, as we had clone, to the strength of those fleets whose peculiar province it was to protect us from the execution of the menaces of the invader? Was it nothing to have succeeded so completely in the blockade of the enemy's flotilla, that instead of venturing on the ocean to attack us, it was with difficulty that it could be slily moved along the coast from one part to another? What would the enemy have said, had we acted in the manner they hare done? Had we in the first instance, prepared an extensive armament for the express and avowed purpose of invading their shores, then allowed it to be insulted at least, if not injured, by the assaults of hostile squadrons, and concluded by sending a flag of truce to the very parties to whom we had denounced destruction. With what exultation would they have then exclaimed, \"such were your threats, and such has been your execution!\" With regard to many of the suggestions which his right hon. friend had thrown out relative to the improvement of the state of the army, he had only to lament, and this he did with the utmost sincerity, that he had not the advantage of official situation to put them into practice; he was convinced that government would hear with attention, and adopt with anxiety any of those suggestions, the propriety of which was obvious. He must repeat what be had said on the measure, which was the object of his right hon. friend's motion. The principle of that measure could not be said to have failed, for only the first part. of it had been put into execution, the last yet remained to be executed. The two parts were perfectly distinct; the on was comparatively torpid and insensible; the other active and vigorous. It would; be a strange, and surely a very contradictory mode of proving to the country the stability of our councils, to abandon a plan to which we had not yet given a fair trial; this would rather be an was nothing of fluctuation and uncertainty: If what he had asserted was tree, if there was nothing in the present situation of out affairs that of could justify in us either precipitation or despondency, but if, on the contray, the measure under consideration contained it the seeds of a permanent system, which623would ultimately put us in possession of a disposable force greater than any one we had yet had at our command, he then thought his right hon. friend had not made but a case sufficiently strong to induce the house to go into the committee lie required.", "author_id": "/people/mr-george-canning", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

If, said the hon. baronet, in December 1803, parliament voted a very considerable augmentation of military force, under a general sense of the danger and exigencies of the country, and the necessity of going far beyond an army suited merely to defence; if that vote has not been given effect; if a total failure of increasing our infantry of the line has occurred; and if even the British regular infantry have decreased in numbers from Jan. 1804 to Jan. 1805, surely such failure, to be attributed only to the inefficiency of the measures adopted by parliament, or to neglect or incapacity of executive ministers to give their measures effect, constitutes a case for enquiry, and for going into a committee (as proposed) for a revision of the laws passed with a view to military levies, and of the exertions and measures adopted by ministers for the like purpose.&#x2014;By the returns on the table, the total army, exclusive of militia, was in Jan. 1804, 143,251 men. Under strong impressions of; the nature and magnitude of the contest in which we were engaged, and with a view to active warfare, and offensive operations, loudly called for by every statesman, nay, by every man in the country who had a sense of the, true interests, honour, or Very safety of the British dominion, parliament in Dec. 9, 1803, voted an army of 191,099 men, being an addition of 47,848 men to the then effective force.&#x2014;Under law as such as have passed, measures such624as have been adopted, and ministers such as have succeeded, has the augmentation voted been acquired? Have the views and injunctions of parliament been accomplished? and if not, is there not a case for revision and enquiry? The right hon. gent. on the other side of the. house, has stated an increase of army within the year of 11,409 men. This is admitted, (but subject to observation on what that increase, consists of and whence it has arisen); but taking it as stated, it leaves a deficit in the augmentation voted in Dec. 1803, for the year 1804, of no less than 36,339 men. The total of army in Jan. 1804 was 143,251; the total in Jan. 1805, 154,660, being an increase of 11,409 men. But in this period, (comprized in the above totals,)18041805The cavalry from17117are21223andhave increased4046The artillery from7661are8517andhave incensed898The foreign troops13890are21208andhave increased7318Making an increase in above services of12261exceeding the total increase of army and therefore leaving to account of decrease in British infantry to such amount of 852 men, notwithstanding 105S infantry raised for rank, and 4297 raised in Scotland and Ireland on similar, or even worse and more destructive terms of levy, and so much is in further proof of a total failure of proper measures for recruiting the line.&#x2014;Looking to establishing the fact of this failure, as ground for a committee of revision and inquiry, he would further observe, that whilst the cavalry encreased only 4046;. 4658 cavalry were in the same period raised for rank; strongly implying that even this favourite branch of service could not sustain its number by ordinary recruiting. But, says the right hon. gent, we have had nearly 7000 men from the army of reserve enlist for general service, and taking these with the 11,000 augmented, we have 18,000 men, disposable force more than we had last year. In this the fallacy is obvious and to be detected, by merely recurring to the nature of the services recruited. Among the foreign troops are 5,401 native Ceylon troops a disposable force? Are 1,018 Canadians and Halifax fencibles a. disposable force? In fact, 6,818 enlisted from limited, for general service, is the only addition, and looking to Great625Britain and Ireland for a disposable force, as here only it can be looked for, our disposable infantry of all description is 53,6ll; perhaps not more than required, on eventual and possible attack, in G. Britain, Ireland, Guernsey, and Jersey, as a regular army to give example to, lead, and conduct, the mass of new levies, militia, and volunteers, throughout the country, has the vote, then, of Dec. 1803, been in any way accomplished? And should we not inquire why it has not been accomplished? Or is the sense of danger past, and the opinion of parliament altered? Certainly not. Late as Jan. 1805 the house has voted for 1805, an army of 22S.234, being (the effective army at the time 154,600) an augmentation of 73,634, doubling in number the existing deficiency. Shall we, for this great and necessary augmentation, depend wholly on measures that have failed, and even without inquiry into how or why they have failed? Or can we trust this additional force bill, so completely as it has been proved inefficient? The right hon. the Chancellor of the Exchequer has, indeed, suggested the further measure of applying to the British militia for 22,586 volunteers, reducing the militia establishment for England to 40,000; for Scotland, to 8000. But, supposing all these volunteers to be acquired, our disciplined defensive force is so much lessened, and what is gained, cannot be called wholly a disposable force; whilst the numbers, if taken on the most sanguine muster, are but a small part indeed of the augmentation voted, under the expressed opinions of the necessary force for adventuring in the war, voted by parliament, according to the sentiments regarding that extent of army, and a disposable force, as delivered by every man who can be called a statesman, on whatever side of the house. Surely the total failure of accomplishment hitherto, and little promise from the same, measures, therefore in future, constitute the strongest case for inquiry and revision of what has been done, what not done, and consideration of what should be done. &#x2014;The hon. baronet concluded with some observations on the state and condition of our army in the West Indies, and from a scene he had been witness to himself, particularly approved the suggestion of his right hon. friend the mover, for abolishing the draft from militia regiments in the West Indies, which left those who had weathered the climate, forlorn and hope-626less to a constant exile, and successive experiment of its fatalities. &#x2014;The house then, divided, when there appeared,For Mr. Windham's motion,96Against it,242Majority against the motion,146", "author_id": "/people/sir-william-young-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1805", "mar", "08"], "content": "observed, that he should proceed upon the discussion of the important subject before their lordships, without making any political or personal allusion whatever; and, it was with regret, that on a debate on a motion brought forward by a noble friend of his, about a fortnight ago, he felt himself under the necessity of making a few observations of that nature. With respect to the question before the house, he doubted not, but their lordships, on a reference to, and a consideration of, what appeared in the official documents upon the table, would make up their minds how it should be decided. With a view to the due illustration of the subject, he had laid on the table several documents, in addition to those moved by the noble baron, who came forward in the present instance, and other noble lords. Some of these respected the artillery, and by the accounts their lordships would see the increase, particularly in that important description of our military force. His lordship then entered into some detailed calculations, drawn from the documents adverted to, and, as one of the results, observed, it would clearly appear, the disposeable force was increased within the year, to an amount exceeding 13,000 men; and this part of the army consisted of corps and troops the best calculated and prepared for foreign or for active service. The noble secretary enforced some of the arguments he had used in the former debate in support of the Additional Force798bill, and contended that, from the united operation and effects of the different measures for the regulation of the military system, the army was considerably increased, and in a progressive state of improvement and increase; so that upon the whole, there was every reason to hope for the expected state of amelioration. With respect to discipline and increased numbers, it was therefore evidently unsafe materially to alter or derange that system. From the plans that were now in operation for organizing the force for limited service, the regular army or disposeable force would be materially benefited. From what he had stated, he trusted it would appear to their lordships, that no fewer than 23,000 men had been added to our military force within the year, as well by the ordinary mode of recruiting, as the other means of raising men, which were in a train of operation. He contended, that on the grounds of 28,000 men being raised within so short an interval, the prospect of a far greater and progressive increase, and the certainty of an improved and improving state of discipline and preparation; it was evident no necessity whatever existed for the proceeding called for by the noble lord's motion. Proceeding again to a detached consideration of the subject, he contended, that from the numbers raised already in the course of the present year, there was every right, taking an average calculation, to suppose that 24,000 men, at least, would be raised before the expiration of the year. Let these numbers be compared with the numbers of men raised within the same intervals, would be still more strongly in his facour. The present aggregate military force was within so small a number as 8,000, of what it amounted to in the concluding years of the late war; taking the subject in every possible point of view, the legislature and the government were called upon to persevere in the system already laid down; the more especially, when the situation of the country, with relation to foreign powers, and still more so, with respect to the enemy, was considered and particularly as far as a disposable force was concerned. His lordship spoke shortly in defence of the army of reserve bill, deeming it upon the whole a good measure and through which a number of men were raised; but at the same time admitted its unavoidably injurious tendency, in raising, throughout the medium of compe-799tition, the bounties to a very high rate. With respect to the noble baron's calculations, that not a greater number than 53,000 men were obtained for general service, he begged leave to differ from him. By his referring to the documents, he thought it must incontrovertibly appear, than 74,000 men were at least obtained for that service. In reference to the ideas suggested, relative to the black corps, he had to observe, that steps were taken for the amelioration of that part of our colonial force.; and as to the rules by which we next were guided, in selecting troops for the West India station, he had only to remark, that care was taken, that such men were preferably sent out, as were least likely to be injured by those climates. Upon the whole, he trusted, that he had proved, and he hoped the determination of their lordships would evince it, that no adequate reason or ground existed for the appointment of such a committee as was moved for by the noble lord.", "author_id": "/people/mr-john-pratt-3", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},
{"date": ["1805", "mar", "08"], "content": "said, that the notification of the motion now before the house had induced his attendance this night. He thought the motion of his noble friend one of the best in every point of view, that could possibly be devised, in the present circumstances of the country: the motion did his noble friend credit, as well as his mode of treating the subject. The noble secretary who answered, or rather who attempted to answer his noble friend; expressed his hope that the house, would decide against the motion; but his hope, his wish, and his advice to the house were that the motion should be agreed to. From the general terms of the motion, which was, that a committee be appointed to revise the acts that have been passed in the two last sessions, for the defence of the country, it was allowable for him to enter into a discussion of these acts, of one of them at least, he should do so, and he trusted in such a way, although it was considered by his noble friend, in that point of view, as that he should convince their lordships its leading provisions were mischievous, injurious, and absurd. The view taken by his noble friend of the act to which he alluded, was chiefly of a military nature. In what he had laid. down in that view of it, he agreed with his noble friend; but the view he should take of it was a still more important one. The fact of its producing but a very small number of. Men was a disadvantage, but its most objectionable effects lay deeper,800and in these views of it the consequences of the measure were truly alarming. Were he to state from memory certain clauses and provisions of the bill to which he alluded, their lordships would regard it to be impossible, that any act of parliament should contain such clauses and provisions. But he had a printed copy of the bill in his pocket, to this he would refer, and if any of their lordships doubted the correctness of his print, they could compare it with the statute upon the table. It was the act for raising and maintaining a permanent additional force, &c.; and passed the 29th day of June last. In the 20th section of this act, for he wished regularly to refer their lordships to the chapter and verse which he quoted, the parish officers were entitled to certain sums. In the 24th section, the bounties were not to exceed three-fourths of the money which should from time to time be allowed as bounties, for the infantry for general service. This was done, no doubt, from a conviction that three-fourths of the bounty would be more acceptable than the whole; or it might be done upon a calculation of the difference in value, between men so raised, and those enlisted for general service. By the 33d section, inspectors were to ascertain the deficiencies in the numbers allotted to be raised by the respective parishes, on which justices of the peace were authorised to assess such parishes, in proportion to the deficiencies aforesaid; the 34th clause enacted, that such penalties should be levied, but not paid out of the poor's rates. They were then necessarily to fall upon the farmers; but he wished to know, how these farmers were to be indemnified. How, but by raising the prices of corn and provisions upon the people! The last bill which affected these things directly, he had singly to oppose. Yet, the bill now referred to was fully as mischievous as that; nay, it went something deeper, and to the full, made as effective a part of the famine-mongering system. This was a strong incontrovertible reason for the committee required by the motion, in order that at least such a nuisance, such an engine in the system of starvation, might be done away. It was not only helping to starve the poor, but, through a rise of the price of labour, to raise the price of manufactures, and so injure their sale in foreign markets; from that would spring the ruin of the commerce of the country, thence the ruin of801its navy and the shipping interests, and, with these, the ruin of its military defence. The antidotes to these dreadful disorders might be had in the discontinuance of a system which starved and famished the people. Better were it not to tax the farmers at all; for whatever taxes were laid on them, would, in case of all direct taxes on the tallow chandler, the brewer, &c.; induce a rise in prices of grain and corn, articles of the first necessity. The rise in these would necessarily beget a rise in the prices of labour; and that by a necessary and mischievous progression would re-act, so as to produce a still further rise in the prices of corn and grain. The effect of the bill was directly to tax the farmer, in addition to all his other, and increasing burdens. It was obvious that the prices of provision had increased, were increasing, and ought to be diminished.&#x2014;As to the military system of the country, though he totally disapproved of. the defence act, yet he wished to see the country well armed. A friend of his out of doors, a person for whom he had a great respect, (major Cartwright) had written well on this subject. Noble lords might laugh, but the noble lord, the secretary of state for the home department, would not laugh when he mentioned another writer on this subject, his own father, who had written a book, when Mr. Jenkinson, on the military defence of the country. This latter book was the most constitutional, legal, learned, scientific, and entertaining tract on the national defence, he had ever perused. Both on the principles of this book, and from his own conviction of the necessity, as well as wisdom, of so doing, he was not only for arming the people, but wished the arming to be more general. But the system of ministers was that of arming the people at present, and starving them afterwards. Besides, there was the utmost reason to apprehend the worst possible consequences from the state of indiscipline in which the force is; though this could not much occasion surprize, when it was recollected that under a noble secretary of state opposite him (lord Camden) the state of indiscipline of Ireland, when he was lord-lieutenant, was such, that general Abercrombie, on arriving in that country, as commander in chief, in 1795, issued a proclamation, stating, among other things, that the army, from its indiscipline, was only formidable to itself, and not to an enemy. The state of our means of de-802fence was not so good-as under the late minister. The present minister was perhaps a man of more brilliant talents, but he was not a man of more good sense, than the late. Yet the present minister thought nothing of calling the noble lord (Sidmouth) fool and simpleton; though the truth Was, that the noble lord had more good sense in his little finger than the now chancellor of the exchequer had in his whole body; and that was not saying much. However, the noble lord was got out of office; and then nothing was heard but the cry of the transcendent merits of Mr. Pitt. Round went the friends of the right hon. gent, about every where, and told the people that he would bring in his Defence bill, which was to correct every abuse, remedy every grievance, and meliorate the whole system of our military force. But, lo! the mountain was in labour, and brought forth this brat of a Defence bill, now in every body's hand. That noisy labour had brought forth only such a rickety subject as would have been disavowed by any one less subject to shame than his majesty's present chancellor of the exchequer! One material objection he had to our military system as it now subsists, was, that we recruited our men for life. To remedy this single grievance, it was incumbent on the house to agree to the motion for a committee, which had been submitted by his noble friend. The book of lieut. col. Wilson on. this subject, was worthy the perusal of their lordships. As a military enquiry, this book, his lordship thought, possessed incomparable merit. But it was in the power of their lordships to devise arguments superior to what could occur to common minds; thus, books by individuals could only be helps to them. Such were, however, good helps. Under all the circumstances of the times, and knowing that there never was a worse bill than the De-fence bill, he would most heartily vote for the motion of his noble friend. The de-fence act ought in all events to be repealed, for it was an act founded on wickedness, and that wickedness founded on fraud.", "author_id": "/people/mr-charles-stanhope", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},
{"date": ["1805", "mar", "08"], "content": "said, that if enquiry was so necessary last year as had been held to be by certain noble lords on the opposite side of the house, he was at a loss to find out why it was not equally so at present. Those noble lords were last year the most strenuous and vehement for an enquiry into the state of the military defence of the country, because they then said the measures pursued, and pursuing by the then administration, were weak, inefficient, and. inadequate to the purpose: every abuse was thrown on the folly, incapacity, and imbecility of those who brought forward those measures; and a noble viscount.(Sid-mouth) now in this house, but who was then at the head of his majesty's administration in the other house, was driven from his place on account of the imbecility of those measures. The noble earl then adverted to what these measures were, which were then called so inadequate, and said, the last of them was the noble viscount's Army of Reserve bill the reason805given for the violent abuse of which Was that it produced only a few men; but now comes this poor, wretched, contemptible parish bill, which turned parish-officers into recruiting serjeants, and yet produced fewer men, but is now called a better bill, and all enquiry into it was said to be minecessary. The noble earl supposed the noble lords would carry the argument up to its utmost climax, and contend that a bill that raised no men at all would be the best of all possible bills. The praise demanded by ministers seemed to be in an inverse proportion to their success. It reminded him of the line in one of Dryden's tragedies, where a lover exclaimed;My wound is great because it is so small.on which a wit who was present cried out,Then twould be greater, were it none at all.In answer to the argument of the noble earl who spoke last, that the bill had not had a fair trial, his lordship observed, that it had been passed as a bill that was to have a speedy and forcible effect; that was to produce men in great numbers, and in & short time; and yet, after Several months, it is alleged that it has not had a fair trial. Whey was it ever brought forward? Why was it ever acted on? It was to supersede measures which had raised a great many men in a very little time, but which were pretended by the framer of this bill to be inefficient and imbecile, yet it turned out to be a more weak and ricketty brat than any of them. Noble lords would recollect, that when the present minister pulled the stool of power from under the noble viscount who was then the minister, he raised an alarm that the enemy was at our very doors, and we were offering up our prayers to Heaven that we might not be swallowed up by Bonaparte. He assured parliament and the country, that he would produce a plan by which the army would be immediately recruited, and relying on which, the country would be safe at home, and would be enabled to carry destruction into the country of the enemy. Fortunately the enemy had not yet come, but now parliament was told by ministers that it must wait some time longer, in order to give their measure a fair trial.&#x2014;The noble earl insisted that the bill had not succeeded in the object for which it was framed, and that it was absurd to say, that in three or four years it might succeed. If a crop were wanted immediately from a piece of land, it would be just as absurd to sow a grain Which required to lie several months in the806ground before ft triage its appearance on the surface.? Perhaps the conduct of Frederic tire Great w Prussia might be instanced by government as a defence of their tardy method of increasing the force of their country. When that military monarch saw any woman remarkable for her height and muscular appearance, he immediately caused her to be married to a grenadier of his body guard, and by this means hoped to produce an Herculean breed from which his army might ultimately be recruited. The progress of the operation of the additional defence act was scarcely less deliberate, and indeed the whale measure deserved nothing but ridicule and contempt. His lordship contended further, that the committee now moved for by his noble friend would embrace many points more than that as to the number of men which had been raised under this bill, and deprecated the hackneyed and antiquated argument of ministers not being pressed in time of war, as that to which their lordships ought not to lend ah ear. He said such a committee would very properly inquire into the propriety of what had been suggested as to enlisting men for a limited time of service, which had been highly recommended by many excellent writers on military affairs, as particularly relating to our own service: the militia and volunteer system might also come under their revision; and though he had the highest opinion of both the militia and volunteers, there were, no doubt, many improvements which yet might be made in, both those systems. He thought inquiry was full as necessary now as it was last year, and he expected an answer from that strong phalanx of ministers who sat opposite to him, which should, at least, contain some reason why inquiry was so necessary and so loudly called for in the case of the weak and imbecile measure of the noble lord (Sidmouth), and so very unnecessary in that of the present bill; which was far the weakest and most imbecile of any that had yet been produced On these grounds he should vote for the motion of his noble friend.", "author_id": "/people/mr-frederick-howard-1", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},
{"date": ["1805", "mar", "08"], "content": "said he rose at this early period to address their lordships, and to call their attention to the nature, of the, motion now before them, on the ground on which it had been supported, and which, he trusted, would induce them to come to a decided negative for without saying it was a motion out of the province of a house of parliament to entertain, it was one which, on807general principles he should have strong objections to, because its tendency was to devolve the military administration of the country on a committee of their lordships, lie could see nothing that could support such a motion but that constitutional ground of want of confidence of that house in the administration of the day, and the fair way of stating it was to call for evidence of facts, to ascertain what the state of the army was at this moment, and it that army was inadequate, and the exertions of ministers had been insufficient for the purposes of our protection, that should be stated as a ground for an address to his majesty to remove his ministers. On that point some difference of opinion might be entertained, perhaps, among those who opposed them; however that might be, it was clearly the object of all motions of this kind, to censure, if not to remove ministers, and in that way he had no difficulty in meeting the motion at once, and to say that no ground existed for such a motion.&#x2014;Having stated this as his opinion on the tendency of such motions as these, he should proceed to observe on the present one, which brought before the house this question, namely, what was the present military situation of this country? And upon that subject he was ready to enter into a full discussion. He was ready to enter into a comparison of the military situation of this country at the present moment, and that of any former period, and of any other country; and to discuss the point also, whether ministers had done all that could be done in that respect. The first question, then, was upon the general amount of our force, and here he must take the liberty of observing, that any stranger who had heard the noble lords who complained to-night of our military system, would be induced to think that we bad, at this moment, a smaller, a less efficient, and worse disciplined army than formerly; now, if the fact was the reverse, if we had now a larger and a better disciplined army than at any former period, he would venture to ask, what ground there was for instituting the extraordinary measure proposed by this motion, in order that noble lords might take the administration of the military affairs of this country into their own hands. Now with respect to our force, he was ready to contend it was not only greater than it had been in any former period in this country, but greater than the military of any other country in comparison to its808population; greater in that respect even than France, possessing for military purposes advantages over others by its revolutionary system, as indeed many others did over a country like ours, where every body was free, and would not be compelled to take upon him the military force of this country, exclusive of the volunteer force, of men who were taken away entirely from productive labour, and accumulating industry, in civil life and purely military in this country at this moment, could not be estimated much below 400,000 in the united kingdom exclusive he must repeat it, of the volunteer force, and which he should presently state. The military force of this country, including officers, was 390,000 men that was to say men who were withdrawn entirely from the civil employment of life and productive labour, and whose pursuits were purely military; this taken from a population, of 15 millions, which, on a calculation, he believed, would produce one&#x2014;fourth capable of bearing arms, that was,3,800,000 of male adults, and this would make actually one-tenth of the whole of the male population of the United Kingdom. Now, to compare this with the situation of other countries, we should see how much our military force was superior in that respect to any other in Europe, although many of these had much greater advantages for producing a military force than we had, although inferior certainly to us in every other respect. The military force of France was not move than 362,000 army, out of a population of 32 millions, the fourth of which, being the male population capable of bearing arms would be 8 millions, and then their army would amount only to the proportion of I out of 14 of the male population capable of bearing arms. If we looked to Russia, its army might be stated at 590,000 men, and its population was 34 millions. The proportion of men capable of bearing arms was 8,500,00, and this would make only 1 out of 14 in the whole male population of that country. Austria had an army of 370,000. Its population was 20 millions. The proportion capable of bearing arms was consequently 5,000,000 and this would be one out of between 13 and 14 of the whole male population capable of bearing arms. The only power in Europe which approached this country as to its military force in comparison to its population, was Prussia. It had a population of 9 millions,809and an army of 250,000 men, which yielded a proportion similar to that of this country, that of one in ten; but Prussia was not like any other power in Europe in respect to her army, for her army was more composed of foreigners than that of any other power. The result of the whole of this calculation was this, that France, Austria, and Prussia, had an army of 1 out of 13 or 14 out of the whole male population capable of bearing arms, except Prussia, which had a great number of foreigners in her force, and this country, in which the army bore a proportion capable of bearing arms. All this with regard to Great Britain, was exclusive of its volunteer force, which was, indeed, a double character, and of incalculable value to the state, for they were men, who besides being efficient in military view, connected in civil life with civil occupations and productive labour, and accumulating industry. Their number was 380,000, which with sea fencibles, to the number of 30,000, made the whole number of men in arms,in the United kingdom, s10,000. That was not 1 in 14, as other countries have, nor 1 in 10, but nearly 1 in 4, of the whole male population of this country capable of bearing arms; a greater proportion than this country ever had before; greater than any other country on the globe has now; greater than France herself ever had with all her facility of producing military force under her revolutionary system, even at its height, under the terror of Robespierre; and all this military force in this country was not growing, as in others it did, out of the distress, the confusion, or the ruin of the country, but out of a system of order, discipline, and riches, such as gave us all security, and not only enabled us to bid defiance to all the attempts or the threats of our enemy, but at the same time stamped sentiment, loyalty, and zeal of the people. Looking, then, at this state of our force, unparalleled as it was in extent, and equal to every purpose for which a force could be desirable, he would ask, was there any ground for saying that the house ought to doubt the efficiency of the executive government, and that its power ought to be delegated to a committee of a house of parliament?&#x2014;He had hitherto considered the question, with reference to the quantity of our force; and he should begin810with that force, which Was in its nature, the most loose, although a very important force under all circumstances, in this country: he meant our volunteer force. He knew that force had been said to have undergone considerable diminution in the course of the last year; but he was prepared to contradict that fact. Indeed if it had undergone some considerable decrease, it would not have disappointed his expectation, but even then he should have said, that the quality of what remained would have made up for the disadvantage of the diminution of numbers. There were two points to be considered in this case; the nominal establishment, and the effective number. That number, officers included, in Great Britain, was 380,000 men. Rank and file they were 342,000 men. He could not give the actual number of those who had been inspected, which was above the 310,000, a large proportion of the whole, and who were actually forthcoming, and fit for immediate service, he believe, from the last return was 307,000, making in all a diminution of no more than 3,000 men out of that immense force; and with respect to the quality of the Volunteer force, he was likewise prepared to state, that from the reports of the officers who had inspected them, and paid the utmost attention to their discipline, a vast mass was reported to be fit for any service, and out of the whole number of 307,000, no more than 22,000 were reported to be deficient in discipline; 210,000 had been on permanent duty, had been subject to the military laws, and to the rigour of military discipline, and to feel what the duties of a soldier were. Upon the efficiency of. such a force, it was unnecessary for him to dwell. Such a mass of men having had experience of a military life, who had submitted to their duty with willingness, readiness, arid zeal, was a force from which we had a right to augur every thing that was advantageous to the country, if they should ever be called into action. He thought it necessary to state thus much on the Volunteer force, to shew it was greater than any other country ever had at any former period, and that it was in discipline so considerably improved, that it exceeded even the hopes of any body at the first institution of that body. He came now to the Regular Army, and he was ready to meet the noble lords, who charged ministers with avoiding specific information, upon that subject, He knew it was the duty of ministers to be811explicit upon that, and upon every other subject on which they possessed information. He should state, therefore, what force we had that was disposable, and what force was limited; and, in no period during the present or the late administration, had ministers attempted to blink that question, they had never declined stating the amount of the army. The army, exclusive of our militia, which by the way was, not only in, quantity, but also in quality, much improved, and every officer in the service would admit that the militia of this country was never at any former period fit to be compared with that body at the present moment in point of discipline, and here he was speaking upon the best authority. Now, what was our army, exclusive of the militia, in all parts of the world? It amounted to 162,000. An army more considerable than we ever bad, before; and, in quality, he would undertake to say, much superior to most of our former force, for it was not composed, as had been customary, with a very large proportion of new levies, but; the greater number of them were inured to the service in battalion, more than ever was the case at any former period in the history of the forces of this country. Of this army, 80,000 were in the plantations, and in the colonies about 56,000, which was the whole of our foreign service at present, except the German Legion; and in G. Britain and Ireland there was a disposable force of about 80,000; but he was perfectly ready to admit that the Whole of that force was not disposable. He observed that the whole of this force could not be sent abroad, for that, besides militia, there must be a certain number of the regular force kept in this country, instead of depending upon the militia; but this was a matter dependent upon circumstances, for if any great attack were made upon the enemy on the continent, that would be a diversion of the power of the enemy, and render his attempt at a descent upon Us the less probable; and in proportion to that, our regular force at home would become disposable which was at present not so; and here he must be allowed to repeat, that estimating the Character of the army of this country at former periods as highly as any noble lord pleased, still be was ready to maintain, that we had a larger and a better disposable army at this moment than this country ever had at any former period whatever. He would admit, however, that812taking the whole of our force together, our limited force was too great, and our unlimited force too little, but that to make a larger, portion disposable would not leave us without sufficient defence; all he wanted to impress, upon their lordships in, this case was that we had now a larger and a better disposable force than we ever had at any former period. But it had been stated there was a great deficiency in our establishment, and the ground was, that there was a deficiency in some of the regiments, and therefore, it was argued, there was a deficiency in our force; this was a fallacious mode of reasoning; because we had a greater number of regiments than were necessary with reference to the whole number of men we wanted; but the only successful way to raise them, was to have them spread as widely as possible, and hence arose the number of regiments, and although some of them were incomplete, it by no means from thence followed that the establishment was deficient; and this distinction was lost sight of when noble lords declaimed against government for having an army on paper only; but the question was not whether we had hot some regiments which were defective, but what was the real amount of our establishment, and this was to be judged of by circumstances, and a reference was to be had to the force of the, enemy likely to operate against us. Why then, if he had clearly established the facts, that we had a larger military establishment of every description than any other country upon earth; a larger army much in proportion to our population, than our enemy had he would ask, what was the ground for calling on that house to institute an investigation which would be productive of no advantage, but which might produce great evils, at all events great hazard, for it would introduce any project with any individual might chuse to propose. A course of proceeding, which he; Would take leave to remind their lordships, was always reprobated by the best informed persons, as a dangerous practice in parliament. He knew that the army was under the superintending care of parliament, as well as every other branch of the executive government in that respect; yet their lordships would recollect historically, not only that the most enlightened statesmen had from time to report bated the practice of the houses of parliament unnecessarily interfering with the813conduct of the executive government, but also that their very journals stated much jealousy of the houses of parliament taking into their hands the business of, executive government; and it had been emphatically said that the sword should never be in any hand but that of his majesty. He would conceive, however, that some specific measures might be proposed, on the emergency of an occasion, and that any noble lord might propose them; and although he should have many objections to any thing of that kind coming from any hands but those of the Executive government, especially if it were a proposition relative to the military establishment of the country, not in point of parliamentary form, for that he knew to be regular, but in point of expediency, which required that every thing of that kind should originate with executive government; still if ministers had neglected to do what ought to be done, the more regular and the safer way would be to move an address to his majesty to remove them. If, however, any noble lord thought that there was any material deficiency, in the conduct of his majesty's ministers, and yet did, not chuse to move that they should be removed, he might move upon it, but then he should make a distinct specific proposition, so that the house might at least; know, the extent of the evil; but this was so general that nobody could see the extent to which it might lead. His lordship then proceeded to defend the additional force bill. He denied, therefore, that this act had been, as was said of it, ineffectual. It had, on the contrary, been very considerably effective, and would be more so, if allowed to proceed. The ordinary recruiting had been increased by it, which had before been very much impaired. The army of reserve bill had raised a greater number of men in a short time, but had been found, to be attended with many inconveniencies, amongst which was that material and important one of raising the bounties. These incoveniencies all fell directly in the way of the success of the present bill at its first outset. To judge fairly of its probable success, they should look at its. operation for the last three months, and they would then be better able to judge what it was likely to do in future. His lordship agreed in opinion with the noble baron who brought forward the motion, as to the general scope of his arugument respecting the black corps; but814the noble baron must recollect that, notwithstanding such a sort of force might be the best for the defence of such a country in such a climate, yet it was of that kind which particularly required that limitation should be attended to; for it would be always necessary to proportion it to the number of white inhabitants, as well as to the number of white troops employed in the defence of the islands&#x2014;His lordship next adverted to the subject of enlisting men for limited service, which had been so much praised, and which might possibly deserve much of the encomium that was paid to it. For his own part, he had given it every attention and consideration in his power, he found it of such high importance, that he would have made himself master of it, if he could; but he found among those who were best informed on the subject whom he had consulted, so much doubt as to its success, that though there might be an appearance of advantage in many points of view, there were so many of a, contrary, tendency which presented themselves, at the same time, that he thought it would be better and safer to adhere to the mode which our excellent constitution had pointed out. His lordship declared himself averse to the system of innovation, which this motion was calculated to produce, and thought it wise to abide by that system which we knew, and of which we had felt the happy effect, by which the British army had been the glory of its country the terror of its foes, and the admiration of the world. He had gone through all the different statements of the noble lords who supported, the motion; he had endeavoured to prove there was no power equal to us upon earth in force, and that the discipline of that force was better than at any former period; he had proved that there was no specific ground for this motion, and that if any noble lord thought, his majesty's ministers had neglected their duty, the regular way was to move an address to his majesty to remove them. He had nothing more to do than, to take notice of the allusion made to what he had said on a former occasion, of the probability being diminished of the enemy making an attempt to attack us by descent; it was true he had said so, but to what was it owing? To a conviction that it would be the ruin and destruction of those who should attempt it. This was the result of the zeal and spirit of the people of this815country, from She commencement of the present war to the present hour, wherein they had shewn themselves greater than ever they appeared in any former period of its history. This was known; this was felt in every part of the world; the effects of which, he was convinced, would prove not only beneficial to us and advantageous to our security, but of permanent advantage, and finally conducive to the security of every country in the world.", "author_id": "/people/mr-robert-jenkinson", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},
{"date": ["1805", "mar", "08"], "content": "said, he would not reply either to the arguments or to the wish of the noble lord who had just sat down. He would leave both to make their foil impression on their lordships with the conviction, that the best idea that could be formed of the minds from which proceeded the measures he and his noble friends condemned, was from the speeches with which it was attempted to support them? He wished, however, that the noble lord, in pity, not to those on that side, but to those whom he wished to defend, bad looked to his right hand and his left before he ventured to charge him and his noble friends with inconsistency, in not supporting the measures the present government had brought forward. he did not mean to charge inconsistency upon his noble friend opposite, who voted for a motion similar to this last year, and who would vote against it this year. He thought that any man who saw reason to think the military state of the country greatly improved, acted an honest and conscientious part in giving his vote accordingly; but for himself, who saw not the smallest reason for changing his former opinion on this subject, lie thought it but reasonable and fair to claim credit at least for consistency, when he thought that if ever necessary, it was tenfold necessary now. But before he proceeded to that part of what he intended to offer to their lordships, he should observe upon the language that had fallen from the noble secretary of state opposite, that it was not fit that any proposition relative to the military state of the country should be originated in parliament, but by the executive government; Gould it be heard without astonishment, in the parlia-821ment of the United Kingdom of G. Britain and Ireland, that that parliament, which regulated and controuled by its acts the amount, the description, and the discipline of the whole armed force of the empire, and which, for the purpose of having that controul more complete, voted all the military acts only from year to year&#x2014;was: it to be heard without astonishment and indignation, that that parliament, or any member of it, bad no right to interfere with its own military acts! that it was to be converted into a mere elective assembly, to sanction or reject by its vote whatever ministers the crown may appoint, and whatever measures those ministers may propose! Such language had for the first time within his parliamentary experience, and he believed within the records of parliament, been uttered this night by a secretary of state, and he was sorry to say, as yet without any mark of the disapprobation of their lordships. In looking back to the proceedings of last year, when a motion precisely similar to that made this night was supported by all that was eminent in rank, talents, and property, in the country, united in what the noble lord opposite was pleased to call a faction, it was but natural to ask, what had been done since to convince any one, except, those who were then of that faction, but now members of the present able administration, that a similar enquiry was not deemed necessary now? Much as he had heard this night with sorrow, there was one thing that he had heard with infinite satisfaction. It was the avowal that the act of last year, the repeal of which had been moved by a noble friend of his, should be altered. He for one would most gladly support any alteration that might be proposed, for it was impossible that any alteration could have any effect but to amend it, though no alteration would be complete but that of a total repeal. He was sure the noble lords opposite saw the necessity of the repeal, for if they did not repeal it, it would repeal itself by falling to a mere nullity. It was, indeed, impossible the act could be enforced by the levy of the penalties. The act gave powers to the parish officers and the penalties were to fall on the parishes, which had no controul over the parish officers to compel them to do their duty. He was sure no court of law in England would compel a man to pay a fine incorred by no delinquency of his own not by any default which it was not822in his power to prevent or controul. He was sure, that if any court of law could be found to authorize such an injustice against the whole people of England, it would be impossible to enforce the decision. In proceeding, however, to the alteration proposed, it was singular that their lordships would have to take the very same step which was now refused because it came from that side of the house. They should go into a committee, in which the whole military state of the country was to be considered. The measure had been proposed at a period when we were told to count not weeks or days, but hours, in expectation of the danger of invasion. It was brought forward as a means of immediately raising a considerable force; yet, after all the predictions that had been, made, and the expectations that had been formed of its success, the result was almost too trifling to be mentioned. Supposing, which he much doubted, that it had raised 2,500 men, was that a number of which a great nation like this could boast, when it was considered how much had been vaunted of the act before it was put in force? The noble secretary of state, in the very extraordinary and delusive statement that he had this evening made, of what he termed the military force of the country, instead of shewing distinctly the situation in which it stood, had wrapped the seamen, the volunteers, & round the real military force, for the purpose, no doubt, of disguising it as much as possible. The object of the Additional Defence act was not to increase our whole military strength, but to raise a large and immediate disposable force. With all the claims which administration had made to the gratitude of the country for their exertions, if the house would look to the returns of the British infantry, they would rind, that in the last year, instead of having increased, it had decreased. On the 1st of Jan. 1804, the number was 105,886; on the 1st Jan. 1805, it only amounted to 105,033, making a decrease of 853 men in the year. After deducting garrisons, & there remained British infantry for general field service 78,195; but an allowance must be made for casualties that had taken place abroad, and of which no mention was made in the returns on the table. In the East Indies, where such bloody, though glorious, battles had been fought, and in the West Indies, where a malignant distemper prevailed, be could not calculate these casual823ties at less than 4,000, reducing the whole number to 74,19. The apportionment of v these troops would be, abroad 31,113, at c home 43,082. But the house should recollect, that our establishments in different t pans of the world must be maintained, c and this, on a moderate computation, would require thirteen thousand men, which I would leave the British infantry in this I country about 30,000 men. The only chance we had of re-establishing G. Britain in the rank which she held in Europe, before the peace of Amiens, was by a. cooperation with the continental powers; but to make this co-operation effectual, we must not be satisfied with granting pecuniary succours; how were we qualified to afford any other? We had but the paltry disposable force of 30,000 men; nor could we send even those to the continent, unless we determined to leave G. Britain with no other defence than the militia and Volunteers, and Ireland with no defence but the militia alone. The noble lord commented severely on the array of reserve act which he termed a wretched measure. It had been imagined by some, that if the defence act were repealed, recourse must be had again to the army of reserve act; but of this there was no danger. He recommended strongly the recruiting for limited service, and concluded by declaring his hearty assent to the motion of his noble friend.", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-grenville", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},

He referred to his own calculations respecting the extraordinary deficiencies in our regular force, compared with its actual amount, and contended that the more he considered this subject, the more he was convinced of the necessity of going into the inquiry which his noble friend had proposed. Another noble friend of his had, on a former occasion, alluded to the defence act, and had exposed its nullity in strong and conclusive terms. This, however, was the only thing which ministers had even attempted to increase our disposable force, and no noble lord could look at its effects without owning, if be spoke his real sentiments, that to trust to such a measure as a means of recruiting our army was little better than downright trifling. He thought that a noble viscount opposite (lord Sidmouth) and some of his late friends, were bound in consistency to vote for the committee if it were for no purpose but that of getting rid of a bill, which last session they had so severely condemned. Among other topics which his R. H. employed in support of the motion, was the state of the army employed in the colonies. The immense draughts of our regular troops to the West India Islands had long been a matter of deep regret, and the means of counteracting this evil had long occupied the attention of military men. The plan of employing corps of Sepoys in these settlements was one which had long struck him as worthy of serious consideration, and which would, if the committee were granted, of course be fully and deliberately enquired into. Many other important points, which on? this as well as on former occasions had been referred, would also demand serious investigation. His R. H. alluded to the present state of the naval defence, which he maintained was inferior in efficiency to what was supported by the noble lord lately at the head of the naval department. Here again he conceived a noble viscount opposite (lord Sidmouth) called on to state whether he gave any countenance to the accusation brought forward in another826place against the late admiralty.

It was not merely the repeal of the defence act which the present motion had in contemplation, but a great variety of other improvements, and the adoption of other means by which our military system might be much perfected. Equally inconsistent was the noble and learned lord on the woolsack in urging the same objection; for when the repeal of the act was proposed, that learned lord opposed the Motion on the ground that it referred to a single measure, and to no new system of measures that might tend to supply its place. When a motion was now proposed to furnish that new system or the opportunity of devising it, that motion equally met with the learned lord's disapprobation and opposition. Such misrepresentations and inconsistencies it was impossible for him to allow to pass by unnoticed and un-reproved.

As far as the general sentiment of the state of the continent reaches, it has my hearty assent; but if it should be sought to pledge us by any thing which has transpired this night, as to the time when aid ought to be given to the continental powers, or any opinion as to continental alliances, in the, existing situation of this country and Europe, and considering too, the difficulty of forming any such, which the right hon. gent, himself has not disguised from usin his speech, I should, sir, for one, and I rather think the committee would be inclined to differ with the right hon. gent. In the mode of bringing this subject forward, which is of a nature unconstitutional, there is a palpable irregularity. Heretofore, every matter of vote was previously brought forward in a committee of supply, whereas, in this instance, it is first agitated in a committee of ways and means. The committee of supply is, however, the only regular place fur such a business: for the house ought, first of all, regularly to decide in a committee on the propriety of the vote, its amount, the time of granting the supply, and all the other preliminary circumstances, of the transaction. And if there was no reason for extraordinary dispatch, all this might as well have happened on the present occasion. From the course that has been taken, we might be supposed to agree to the propriety of the sum; and not even to object to an almost immediate appropria-553tion. As the vote stands, the house might seem pledged to the grant. The 'right hon. gent, might, accordingly, on any future day, tell the house that there could be no material objection to provide for the sum; yet, most probably, we should see occasion- to object not only to the lime and manner, but also to the quantum employed. Undoubtedly, sir, I can believe that the right hon. gent. has no intention to jock up the judgment of the committee, I dare say he meant the question of the propriety of the vote to be left to the house; but as, still, the house might be thought pledged in some sense to the measure, I have thought it my duty to guard against the possibility of surprise.&#x2014;With regard to the taxes, some of them appeal to me to be extremely objectionable. The tax on horses employed in husbandry is of this nature; for I know of no tax that could be more severe on a class of men more useful. Before imposing such a tax, every enquiry ought to have been instituted, as to the ability of the persons on whom it must fall to pay it, without the total ruin of their prospects. No doubt the right hon. gent. has enquired respecting this; but I apprehend that more enquiry than he can have made was necessary. This tax will assuredly be much felt in the country. I have also, sir, a great objection to the tax on salt; but as the propriety of adopting it will be discussed hereafter, I shall not now enter into it. In another view I could wish, sir, to consider these taxes. The mode of raising the taxes within the year has my approbation, in a general way. The principle, if not found to be inconvenient in its operation, is good. But here the operation of the principle cannot prove beneficent. It must operate vexatiously. All the taxes proposed to be raised are of a nature to cause the utmost inconvenience, and operate as an intolerable hardship. They are almost all of them direct taxes. Excepting the tax on salt, hardly any thing is proposed to be raised on consumption; yet the tax on consumption is probably the only legitimate tax. Nay, sir; I doubt whether hereafter we can have any taxes on consumption. When I am told that the taxes oa consumption, now subsisting, have experienced a considerable defalcation, I must be of opinion, that the sources of taxes have been impaired. Without doubt, the defalcation of 1,200,0.00l. on a revenue of 50 millions is not very alarming, provided it does not continue to en-554crease. But when a diminution to that amount does exist, I do think there is some ground for apprehending that our, taxes on consumption haves reached, the limit, beyond which they cannot be made more productive. Another ground of objection with me is, the tax on property. The addition now proposed, I am sorry to say, will, if I am not much mistaken, lay the foundation of endless calamity to this country. One great objection to the tax on income is, that it affords a facility of getting near what we would most lament, that state in which a minister could take the property of the subject indiscriminately. This is precisely what we have to lament in regard to the tax on property, which can only operate as a facility to that deprecated end. This time 25l. per cent, are added, possibly there will be next time 25l. per cent, more put on it; after that, possibly, it will be doubled, then, possibly, trebled, until the principle is silently, but fatally established, of taking the money of the subject wherever, and however it may be found. I have also another objection to this tax, that though it is less unequal than the income tax, it is still very unequal. Landed property and property in the funds contribute fairly. But the other descriptions of property, such as arise from commerce and industry, do not pay in any proportion. If this is the case, I tremble for the consequence of going on increasing this tax. If a property tax be allowable^ even in time of war, it is only on the ground of its being regular and moderate. If this is to continue many years, and consumption, so far as yielding a revenue, is at I an end, it is likely the property tax will be considered as a land tax, or any of those other taxes that are voted annually as matters of course. I do not say that this crisis is near, God forbid it should be! If ever we come to the state when we cannot levy taxes on consumption, we shall inevitably be going the road that leads to the point at which we take from our income, where we can, and all we can, till we go to the principal, and in time take that like wise. With these impressions of the vast impolicy of such a growing tax as this, I own to you, sir, that I do from my heart wish the right hon. gent. could have devised any other measure. I never approved of this tax, nor of the principle on which it was founded, and I think that limits should be set to it which cannot be exceeded. In my mind, the taxes proposed, particularly555that oh salt, will be found highly exceptionable, and I do from my conscience believe, that others less oppressive must be eventually resorted to.", "author_id": "/people/mr-charles-fox-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

For when a house tax became too high, a man might avoid it by ceasing to keep any house; but property was a thing by which there could be no limit till the whole was taken.

It was surprising, that after a report of the committee of this house had been so long on the table, recommending the entire abolition of the salt duty, the first thing we should hear was a double duty being laid on that article. It was a breach of faith-in some measure, and must give the country a bad impression of parliament itself. Suppose a case in private life, where a superior should hold out hopes to a dependant, that he should be relieved from grievances of which he justly complained: what would be thought of that superior if, instead of relief, he should double the burden It was trifling with the people to hold out expectations to them without attempting to realize them. So much for England. But the case was worse with respect to Scotland. There it would be impossible to go through with this bill. Formerly when the duty was 10s. in England, in Scotland it was 6s. 6d. From this it was found necessary to lower it to 4s. If it was scarcely possible to collect it then, what could be done now, when the duty was so much more? The difficulty of making salt in Scotland would not account for the impossibility found in collecting the duty there. This difficulty arose from-making salt there from sea water, instead of salt springs, which contained more saline matter; but in Scotland, they used the rock salt of Chester in general, as well as, in- England. The tax fell much more severely on the poor than789on the rich, for a poor man especially in Scotland, was compelled to live principally on vegetable food, which required a great quantity of salt to stimulate digestion. The net produce of the tax in Scotland was 47,000l. This sum was nearly all expended in bounties to the Herring Fishery, and in the charges of collection, and therefore scarcely any thing was gained by it to the public. The design of the society for improving the Highlands, as appeared from their reports, was to prevent, as much as possible, the augmentation of the tax on salt, which had so bad an effect on the Herring Fishery. In the year 1769, in the Isle of Man, where the duty did not exist, the inhabitants were about 7000. They had since increased to 30,000, chiefly, perhaps, owing to their exemption from this duty. He had another objection to the tax, which was, that this heavy burden was laid on the people, for paying the interest of five millions subsidy to be given to the powers on the continent. We had no information of the nature of the services to be performed for it. It was vain to subsidize the northern powers, because, in order to make an impression on France, the co-operation of one, or both of the great powers contiguous to France was necessary.", "author_id": "/people/mr-george-johnstone", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

He contended, that the salt duties in Scotland could never be made to amount to more than 45,000l. a year, as there was a great chymical difference between the salt produced from sea-water in that country, and what was in England produced from springs impregnated with rock salt, insomuch that one bushel of Liverpool salt was equal to three bushels of Scotch salt.", "author_id": "/people/mr-charles-kinnaird", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

Instead of adopting such a measure as the present, he would advise the Colleagues of that right hon. gent, to take the liberty of recommending him in private to look at economy in the public expenditure. When his majesty's servants thought proper to have recourse to severe taxes of this kind, he thought it was full time to endeavour to find a substitute for them in the retrenchments, which were so loudly called for in the public expenditure. An hon. admiral (Markham) of high authority, had lately stated, (see p. 684), that a saving of one-third might be made in the naval expenditure, which was now 15 million annually; and if they could retrench even one thirteenth part of it, the people of the country might be saved some of the hardships to which they were now subjected.

To those who were not in the house at the time when he put some questions to the678gentlemen at the other side, whether they had any intention to prolong the commission, it was necessary for him to state, that he had put such questions, and had received no answer; and this was the cause of what might otherwise appear extraordinary, that the motion for the continuance was brought forward by him. Every person must admit, that the object of the commission, which was, to inquire into the irregularities and abuses connected with the navy, must be desirable. The persons appointed had, in the two years they had been in office, pursued the enquiry with an industry and integrity deserving the highest approbation; and their merit was established beyond the necessity of further proof, by the reports they had laid on the table of the house. At this moment they were still actively continuing their investigation, and they had yet much to do. The duration of the act by which the commission held its powers was uncertain. The act of the crown, which was but another term for the will and pleasure of a minister, might put an end to it in a moment, by proroguing parliament only for a day. The duration of the act was fixed, at its passing for two years, from the 29th of Dec. 1S02, and to the end of the next ensuing session of parliament. If parliament had met, as in the usual course, before the 29th Dec. the act would have held in force for another year. It was probably in the contemplation of parliament, at the time of the enactment, to afford an opportunity for the renewal of the act, if it should be thought advisable, by allowing the whole of a session of parliament to make a motion to that effect, in addition to the greater part of the session in which the expiration was likely to take place. He made this motion thus early in the session, because the commission was issued by act of parliament, and if parliament should think it necessary to continue it, it may be on its guard to do so before the act of a minister would deprive it of the power. He was not disposed, in cases of this kindy to place much confidence in men; The change that had taken place in administration, though it had not produced much vigour, had introduced much boldness. Another reason why he put himself forward on this subject so early was, that ministers on the subject of the suspension of theHabeas Corpus Actin Ireland, which they described as. so necessary and impor-679tant, had shewn so little vigilance as to render it unavoidably necessary to break through the forms of the other house to hurry the bill through, before the expiration of that which it was to replace, and even then a day or two of adverse wind would have caused it to arrive too late. Here the lion, and learned gent, recited the objects which the commissioners were empowered to inquire into. The official departments of the navy were the principal. Of these the admiralty had not been yet attended to. The navy board was much considered in the sixth report, but not completely examined. The office of the treasurer of the navy was described in the last report laid on the table; the victualling board had not yet been in any way noticed; nor the office for sick and wounded seamen, the department of prisoners at war or the transport office, nor the office of inspector of naval works. Thus a great part of the task imposed on the commissioners of enquiry remained yet unexecuted. It was impossible that in the ordinary duration of the session this remnant of the proposed labour could be gone through before its close. Much inconvenience would result from its non-continuance, which lie proposed to remedy by moving to continue it till the next session, when, if its further continuance was necessary, another motion of the same nature may be made. Those who supported the appointment of the commission were now called upon to vote for its continuance; and even those who opposed it, seeing the advantages that had resulted from the inquiry, were equally bound to give it full effect. The commission lately granted under the great seal to consider what remedies should be adopted for the evils discovered by the commissioners of enquiry, proved that the navy board was not adequate to the inquiry, as it was formerly urged by some, for this late commission stated, that the navy board was too much occupied to undertake even the secondary supervision there specified. He thought it not quite respectful to the house to. appoint, without any communication, those commissioners by royal authority, to act upon the reports of a commission appointed by parliament. The predecessor of the right hon. gent, has said, it was intended to submit to parliament distinct propositions on the. reports. The abandonment of this plan, and. the institution of the new royal So commission, he looked upon as disrepect-680ful to parliament. If the motion for the continuation of the act was not assented to, it would be seen, that there was in ministers a determination to resist reform. It was most notorious, that great abuses existed in all departments of the naval service; and those who made notoriety the ground for suspending theHabeas Corpus Act, could not deny it as a ground for the continuance of this commission.

But it was to be kept in view, that the proceedings of the commissioners had already been extremely laborious, that they had furnished many voluminous Reports, and that there was no reason whatever to suppose that in the short time which might intervene, previous to the termination of session, there would be time for bringing their investigations to a satisfactory conclusion.

It was the more necessary to allude to this, for he had formerly seen reports of abuses in the naval department which were suffered to sink into complete oblivion. He could remember 20 years ago such reports, and to this, though improvements had been suggested, they had never been reduced to practice, nor had enquiries, of which there was much promise and strong expectation, produced one important result, except the satisfaction of knowing that the public had been grossly plundered.

There was among these commissioners one name, the insertion of which in a commission appointed for enquiring into the means of reforming abuses in the navy, was to him altogether unaccountable. This name was the name of Mr. Fordyce, who has for several years been supposed to be indebted to the public in no less a sum than the sum of 80,000l.

It was evident that the bill, if allowed to be good at all, could not fulfil its object previous to the expiration of the session. There was no force at all in the observation of the right hon. gent, opposite, that at this period of the session the renewal was unnecessary. The house could have no means of knowing when the session was to terminate. It might terminate exactly when it suited the whim or the interest of a minister. But was the house to be told that an act, on all hands allowed to be beneficial, to be renewed just at the period when it suited the minister, and not when it was called for by the public interest? The idea was monstrous, and not to be endured for a moment. If parliamentary inquiry was to be instituted at all, then let it be instituted in the true spirit of inquiry, and not dependent on a minister's arrangement. But the right hon. gent. had endeavoured to argue, that there probably might be no necessity for renewing the act. Now, what single tittle of evidence had been adduced to countenance such an opinion? It was contrary to every conjecture, and every probability.687It was directly in opposition to the declared opinion of two hon. and gallant officers; the best acquainted with the subject. These hon. officers had expressly agreed, that it would be quite impossible for the commissioners to finish their inquiries within the period which might be expected to intervene, previous to the close of the session. One of the hon. officers (Sir C. Pole) had, indeed, expressed some doubt as to the continuance of the commission during the existence of a war; but he had expressed no doubt that much yet remained to be investigated, much yet was to be done be sore the mass of public abuses was laid open to view. He really could not help being astonished at the attempt to get rid of the original motion, by moving the order of the day. This was surely evading the: question in a most unhandsome and indefensible manner. If the right hon. gent, thought the commission unnecessary, or conceived that the commissioners made an undue use of their powers, why did he not, like the worthy baronet opposite (Sir W. Elford), state such an opinion openly and manfully? The worthy baronet had declared himself dissatisfied with the naval commissioners, and had expressed his opinion, that their inquiries should be discontinued. He had stated, that their Reports ought to be examined into, because he conceived they afforded ground for grave accusation. The hon. member had acted now as he did on a former occasion. On that occasion he had brought forward a direct charge, but by some misfortune or other, no member could be found to second his proposition.

If the right hon. gent, entertained similar ideas, why was it that he did not pursue a similar course? Surely it would be a course at once more honourable, as well as more parliamentary. To get rid of the motion by moving the order of the day was far from being a fair or candid proceeding. If gentlemen objected to the continuance of the commission, they would afterwards have a full opportunity of expressing their sentiments. They ought at least to suffer the bill to be introduced, and on the second reading they might then take the sense of the house, whether, it should be allowed to go to any subsequent stage. They had then only to oppose it, and. say directly at explicitly that the commission should688be closed. He thought that those who originally supported the act were now bound by every call of consistency to vote for the original motion. If they thought inquiry necessary, they certainly were bound to see that this inquiry was fully and advantageously pursued. If they had thought that gross abuses existed, on what principle was it that they refused their assistance in bringing them to punishment? On every view of public interest he was decidedly in favour, of the original motion, which he trusted the house would not suffer to be got rid of by the unfair and unmanly expedient proposed.", "author_id": "/people/mr-charles-fox-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

The farmers of this country, he said, were by no means that very opulent class of men they had been falsely represented to be, and he was well convinced, the times were better862for the farmer, when corn sold at 8s. or 9s. per bushel, than in those in which it had reached the very high prices, at which it had been in the course of a few years last past. He had been told, that this tax would, as taxes generally do, fall on the consumer, but who, be asked, are the consumers? The answer is very direct said he; those who eat bread: as such, it must fall with the greatest weight on the lower and poorer orders of the community, and therefore he was averse from it. A committee above stai[...]s had, in the course of last session, been a long time employed to enquire into the most effectual means of reducing the price corn, and, consequently, of bread, and the result of that inquiry was, that it would be necessary to take every possible step towards the improvement of agriculture. The present tax, he was convinced, would very materially impede the interests of agriculture, and there fore he was against it. He did not say this from any captious opposition to taxes, but from a thorough conviction, in his own mind, that he was strongly impelled by his duty to make the observations he had done.", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-plumer", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

Whenever this matter came to be canvassed, he should feel himself as not at all compromised by the vote he should give on the present occasion. A great deal had been said as to the intention of those who brought forward the measure, as to the time of its continuance. One hon. officer (Sir C. Pole) had declared his opinion, that it was not meant to be continued during a period of war. It was true that another hon. officer (Admiral Markham), had expressed his opinion that it was meant to be of unlimited duration, as long as there was any subject of inquiry not thoroughly investigated. Now, he contended, that with such opposite and contradictory opinions, in such a state of ambiguity, the house ought to pause before they came to any certain determination. This was precisely the object with the amendment he had in view. It was designed not to operate as a decision that the commission should be discontinued, but as a means of giving the house time to reflect to what period it should be extended, or whether it might not be possible to derive all the information required) without any renewal of the bill. Even allowing that parliament in the first instance intended that the bill should be extended to a period beyond what it would reach to without a new bill, the house now were not to be bound by such a determination. They were to be guided by dictates of policy and expediency. One hon. officer was of opinion that we ought by all means to preserve the commission in existence. Another hon. officer, equally well qualified to judge on the subject, thought, that during war, that operations689of the commission would be attended with many difficulties and embarrassments. When this was the case, what was there more natural than to adopt the amendment, which did not at all injure the commission at present, and presented the consequences of a too precipitate decision. There had been a good deal advanced respecting the propriety of bringing forward charges against the naval commissioners, if they were supposed guilty of any act of oppression. What situation would parliament be reduced to, if not a word were to be uttered in that house against a commission of five persons possessing larger powers than had ever been entrusted to an equal number of men? Was it not competent to any member to call in question the propriety of allowing a body to proceed in their usual way, which had been charged with having published a libel against so admirable a part of our constitution as the grand jury of a county? He did not think it decorous, that an hon. member, when such was his object, should be publicly asked, whether he was prepared to substantiate a criminal charge against the persons composing that commission.

He thought that parliament having once adopted the measure, was, in consistency, bound to continue it. There was little apprehension, that the ideas thrown out by some persons, respecting the danger which might result from the existence of such a commission, without any thing to operate upon, should ever be realised. The abuses which it was the object of it to discover and correct were numerous and notorious, and he hoped, that the advocates for passing strong measures, such as the suspension of the habeas corpus act in Ireland, upon the sole grounds of notoriety, would not deem themselves justifiable in opposing a measure founded on their own principles, and from the continuance of which it was universally allowed the public had derived the most extensive and important advantages.", "author_id": "/people/lord-henry-petty", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

It was allowed on all hands that the commissioners acting under this bill had, throughout the whole of their conduct, with the exception of one single instance only, deserved the highest praise. Why, then, should the house hesitate to invest such commissioners with the powers necessary to enable them to discharge their duty with full effect? In order to this, he thought the existence of their power should be stable, and not dependant on the duration of a session. As to the danger apprehended from such a commission during the existence of a war, he thought that the experience we had already had, was sufficient to remove that apprehension. The commission had originated in time of peace, but yet we had been at war during the greater part of its continuance, and yet no inconvenience whatever, appeared to have resulted from it, but quite the contrary; and it was his opinion, and that of many gallant and intelligent officers, that if it were interrupted in its progress before its investigations' should be completed, very great mischiefs would arise. An hon. baronet had stated, that if the object of the commission appeared to be unattainable before the expiration of the sessions, application would and ought to be then made for the continuance of the bill. But he would put it to the candid consideration of the house, whether, thinking as they and the public did, of the exertions of these commissioners, it would be decorous to limit them in point of time, or wait for their application to continue the act? Whether it would not be more becoming to be beforehand with them, and to renew the bill at once? His opinion was decidedly in favour of the latter692course, and he saw no good, though he could well suppose much evil, that might fellow from the postponement proposed by the motion of the right hon. the Chancellor of the Exchequer. To the assurance of that right hon. gent, that he would bring forward a proposition for the continuance of the act under consideration in the course of the session, should necessity appear to call for it, he was ready to give credit. But it might happen that the right hon. gent, however well disposed, would be unable to carry the proposition into effect. Many changes might occur in the course of a session; he did not mean to speak as to ordinary events; but even in the situation of the right hon. gent, a change might occur. Perhaps the right hon. gent. did not feel at all the uncertainty of a situation in power, though he could assure him, that he himself felt that uncertainty; and therefore it was that he could not entirely rely on the right hon. gent.'s promise, or, rather, that he could not rely on his capacity to fulfil it. He would not risk this important bill upon a contingency, and if the situation of the right hon. gent. should be changed* his wishes and eloquence might not possibly have sufficient influence to carry the renewal of this bill. For this reason it was, that he desired to press the motion for its renewal at present; and also, because he thought such immediate renewal necessary to give vigour and efficacy to the operation of the commission. No man could suppose that that commission could proceed with such effect, if they were to calculate upon the expiration of their power within three or four months, as if that power were enlarged in the manner proposed by the motion. It was impossible indeed, that they could accomplish the object of their inquiry within the session. They had, he understood, much information to look for from distant countries, particularly in their enquiry into the victualling department. How then could it be reckoned upon that such enquiry could be completed within a short time; particularly as it was stated by his noble friend, that their business was fast accumulating? With respect to the allusions made to the views of those by whom the motion was proposed, those views he did not know; but he knew the view which induced him originally to support this bill. That view was, because he thought it proper and necessary to investigate the abuses that were generally supposed to ex-693ist in the expence of the different departments of the navy. Of this necessity he was now fully convinced. The vast mass of evidence on the table, furnished by the reports of those commissioners, was the best testimony of their merit, and the strongest argument in favour of the motion before the house. Those reports contained such matter as was highly deserving the attention of the house, and such as he trusted would, by becoming the subject of serious consideration, prove that parliament was as anxious to interest itself in the concerns of public economy as in any other subject.", "author_id": "/people/mr-george-tierney", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

He did not say, that the usual punishments inflicted were more severe than necessary, for which reason, the clause he should recommend, would, in its effects, rather serve to strengthen the powers of regimental courts martial. As it must, however, be confessed that the punishments were at times extremely rigid, the greater attention should be paid to have them carefully administered. If the same gravity and dignity were infused into these regimental, that always accompanied general courts martial, the men, finding the same impartial trial in the one, as in the other, would be naturally led to a more cheerful compliance with their decisions. He maintained that the powers given to regimental courts martial went beyond the object for which they were originally established, which the act itself stated to be for the trial of small offences, which words certainly must imply that they would be limited to the infliction of small punishments. They were never designed to try mutiny, desertion, thefts, and those other serious charges which, were now brought before them; and though in usage the intention of the act had been prevented, yet if it had been foreseen that such causes would have been brought before them, there could be no doubt that they would have been subjected to the same solemnities of oaths as in general courts martial. To his proposal he never had heard any other objection made than the general one, that it would be an innovation in the service; but the same argument was applicable to any improvement that could be offered, and would have formerly applied with equal force against the bill itself. As the object of administering oaths was acceded to by the secretary at war, what remained for him to submit was, that the presidents on such courts should not be under the age of 21 years. He proposed it on the same principle on which it was required, that none should preside in general courts martial who were not of the rank of field officers, the object of which was, to provide that the presidents should be persons of a competent experience. It might, indeed, be said, that the presidents of regimental courts martial were required to be of the rank of captains, and that if a man was859not fit for Such a president, he could not be fit to command a company. In answer to this, he would declare it as his opinion, that it would be a good and salutary measure, if captains were required to be of the age of 21 years. He thought the genius and talents of some young men would offer an exception to this regulation, but, as a general rule, he thought it might have very favourable consequences as to the service.

He said he was not in the habit of offering himself to the attention of the house, but the strong call of duty constrained him to overcome his natural reluctance. He admitted the present bill was less objectionable than that which had been adopted in 1799, from the modifications it had received; but as he must resist the principle of it, those variations could not reconcile him to the measure. The bill was brought forward without any ground being laid for its introduction. When the former one was submitted to the attention of the house, a case of remarkable urgency was made out, although not such a case as, in his mind, vindicated the expedient. What was the situation at that time? In the year 1799, we had a prodigious defensive force: the Militia exceeded 100,000 men, and we had a numerous body of Fencibles. On the contrary, the regular army was wasted by a protracted war; and it was under these peculiar circumstances that it was permitted to recruit out of the Fencibles and out of the Militia, under the authority of parliament. In this instance the same scheme was recommended, when113the motive was gone. We were told by the right hon. the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the regular army had greatly increased; that the recruiting was active and effectual; and that his favourite act for the, augmentation of the disposeable force, was soon to be brought into complete operation. Why then should we resort to this odious and obnoxious method? If the quota of 17,000 would not enter as volunteers, would the right hon. gent. disband the national Militia? Did he, after all his expressions of doubt and alarm, begin now to consider the garrison of the Country as too strong? Had the fears of the nation been absurd and nugatory? Were the fleets of the enemy destroyed? Were his armies disbanded? Was his ambition annihilated? Did the invasion of this country no longer tempt his appetite for universal dominion? But there were constitutional objections to the measure. Every standing army in Europe, which menaced or destroyed the liberties of the soil by which it was supported, we were told, had its origin in a harmless militia; we ought, then, never to lose sight of that precaution we ought never to abandon that jealousy, which would prevent such dangerous encroachments. The best officers in the militia had been disgusted by the former regulation, and had retired from the service; but it was promised no such plan would be revived. Now insult and flattery were combined, and it was vainly expected gentlemen would submit to such illusions, and patiently bear with repeated mortifications. Whenever the act of 1799 had been mentioned in that house, and it never was mentioned unaccompanied by censure, it had been defended by ministers on the ground of the necessity of the times, and a solemn pledge had been given never to recur to the same mode of proceeding After this open breach of faith, how could we depend on any future pledge? how could we assure ourselves that when it was deemed convenient, government might not once more return to the charge and propose a further recruiting out of the 40,000 that were now allowed to exist?

{"date": ["1805", "mar", "26"], "content": "said, it was not to be supposed he had any objection to the increase of the troops of the line. That was an ob-124ject so much in conformity with all the sentiments he had maintained, and so directly in opposition to all those that had been supported by the right hon. gent. who moved this measure, that it was not likely he should oppose him in it. The right hon. gent. was now employed in taking down a part of the building which he had been so long employed in erecting. He applauded the workman and be applauded the work. It was a satisfaction to find that the right hon. gent. was so good-naturedly disposed to correct every thing erroneous he might have formerly established. Considering the length of time the right hon. gent. had formerly been in power, considering he was now in power again, and that many wished him to remain in power, it would be to be lamented indeed if he adhered to every error he had fallen into. The right hon. gent. had completely relieved the house from that apprehension, for a more formal, distinct, and pointed recantation of his former principles and practice could not possibly be exhibited. It was certainly a departure from his former system only in part, for with a happy variety, it contained in it what, in the sporting, language was called \"a hedge,\" the effect of which was, that there was a chance the right hon. gent. would at all events win. Here the hon. gent. adverted to the extent to which the militia system had been from time to time carried. The English militia was increased by the addition of the supplementary; then the Scotch militia was added, and afterwards the Irish. The building was elevated by heaping Pelion upon Ossa, story on story, till it was impossible to go further. The right hon. gent was at that time in the militia line, he afterwards opened shop for the abolition of the ballot; He had, however, stuck to the old trade till it failed; he kept close to the ballot till its death, and he cried out its last speech in the introduction of his parish bill&#x2014;this parish beauty, in coarse russet clad; of whom he was so violently enamoured. The ballot had not been given up till late. It had been given up, however; it was found that it increased the bounty, and that, by it means, men were not to be had for general service. Then the right hon. gent. set out with a general declamation against the ballot, which he at length found out was very injurious to the service. The abolition of the ballot was one step towards that negative system, which he and his125hon. friends had recommended. When being asked for their plan, they said it consisted merely in getting rid of all the impediments that checked the simple recruiting. TO remove an evil was certainly the first step towards effecting good; but the right hon. gent.'s change had not this effect. Two negatives, it was said, made an affirmative; but the right hon. gent.'s second proceeding was but a further departure from his former principles and practice. His parish bill went to abolish the ballot, or at least to remove it to a considerable distance. But if that took it away, this measure gave it back. Because the parish bill removed it to too great a distance, this brought it near, so as to enable him more easily to come at it. These observations, he confessed, went more to the author of the measure, than to the measure itself; but though measures were to be judged of in themselves, yet a part of their credit was connected with the personal character of those from whom they proceeded, and therefore what he had said on this head was not improper nor irrelevant. The right hon. gent. had argued, that he and those who were of opinion with him that the regular force was too small, and the Militia too large, ought to support this measure. Certainly, it would not be inconsistent in them to support it, but they were not therefore necessarily to do so. Though they argued that the militia should be reduced, and the regular army augmented, they were not therefore bound to approve all means whatsoever proposed for carrying those objects into effect. His objection to this measure was, that it did not produce advantage to the regulars in proportion as it did injury to the militia. The only difference was, that the number of men transferred would be applied to more advantageous service. He allowed the service was more advantageous; but it was not trained men that the army wanted, and he put it to the regular officers, whether they would not prefer unexercised men to those disciplined militia, who would never make good troops. He did not say that the militia were not in every respect equal to the regulars in training; in many instances they were accustomed to equally severe discipline, but from the nature of the service there was always something hanging about a militia-man which rendered him more untractable than was consistent with the well-being of the regular service. He did not mean in126this to argue that should ever be taken from the militia to the line, but never without great emergency.&#x2014;Another objection was much more extensive, and was founded on a remark which he had formerly made, that measures ought to be adopted wholly and not partially, as in the present instance, because the success often depended on the union of the several parts. In the plan which he had formerly proposed, the right hon. gent. seemed to have forgot that he had included service for a limited term of years, and the improvement of the condition of the soldiers. If this were adopted, people would flock to the army like bees, as long as you had a hive to receive them. He allowed that, if necessity required, he himself would be ready to take stronger steps with respect to time militia than the present, and he considered the mitigations allowed by the right hon. gent. as the most convincing proofs that the necessity of the measure was not felt.&#x2014;He regarded these expedients so frequently varied, as the ruinous resources of a spendthrift prodigal, who, to supply the want of the moment, cuts down the young timber of his estate, which in a little time would be double its present value. Those ministers who had reproached their predecessors with inefficiency, had found that they could not get through their own measures for six months. The shifts resorted to front day to day, by them, was an argument for the committee he had had the honour on a late occasion to propose. He did not believe this measure was in contemplation when the parish bill was introduced, which was a proof, that the system of ministers was temporary and unstable. Thus the parish bill, which was to produce 27,000 men, of which 9000 were to be allowed to go into the regulars every year, and to be supplied again from the country, had produced about 2000, which was nearly the same proportion a tailor bore to a man. Thus, instead of the full grown man that had been promised, the country must now content itself with this miserable tailor's apprentice. The house was in fact reduced to subsist upon its votes, as a noble lord had very properly expressed it on a former occasion. The house had voted the measure of last session, in the hope that it would produce recruits for the army to a great amount. The hope had failed. Now this measure was called for with similar promises, and it was unknown what127other equally infallible expedient was in reserve, if the promised hope should not be fulfilled. The measure now proposed would be attended with great inconvenience, and the officers of the militia were averse to it. He took occasion to revert to the irritation with which his hints at the propriety of reducing the militia had been formerly received. He then admonished the friends of that system, that they had less to apprehend from those who openly attacked them, than from those who afforded them a treacherous defence. (see vol. 3. p 606). There was a Spanish proverb, which said, \"protect me from my friends, and I will guard myself against my enemies.\" This applied well to the militia in the present instance. The right hon. gent. opposite (Mr. Yorke) had argued forcibly in support of his own sentiment on this occasion, but he allowed he had but few of his brother officers of militia with him. The question was not which opinion was right, but which opinion prevailed; not what they ought to feel, but what they do feel. When the right hon. gent. said, that 18 out of 32 militia colonels, who signed the resolutions against this measure, were actuated by party principles of opposition to ministers, he surely did not see the effect of this position; for if so large a portion of the aristocracy of the country, the runk, the landed property, and influence, were to be seized upon a distinct question of this kind, to convey their decided disapprobation of the ministers of the time, it was a pretty clear proof of the sense the best part of the country entertained of these ministers. The generality of the feeling, however, let what may be the cause of it, afforded no argument for the success of the measure. The country, notwithstanding the extraordinary success of all the measures recommended from the other side, was still extremely at it loss for a disposable force; this, with the expectation of possible circumstances in Europe to afford room for employing this force, were the reasons for resorting to that which the govt. was pledged not to recur to, except in cases of extreme necessity. The repetition of this measure went totally to change the militia from its original constitution, to destroy the principle connection, and thus to do a vast injury to the home service, without having any thing like a permanent good effect on the army. This measure could not be made a part of a general system for recruiting the128army. It was a measure of such a nature, that we could not long go on in it, but should soon come to a total stop. Our military system should be so constructed that its parts would correspond with and assist each other. The consequence of doing this thing in this case was, that one part of the existing system acted in one direction and another in the opposite. Then there was a sort of compromise, and such a compromise was most ruinous to any thing like a general system. For all these reasons, and tor many others, which he could adduce, he thought himself perfectly consistent in opposing this bill.&#x2014;The question being called for, the house divided&#x2014;For the second reading148Against it59Majority89 The bill was then read a second time, and ordered to be committed on Thursday.&#x2014;Adjourned.", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-windham-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

The cases stated, though I hope not likely to happen, ought to be provided for. The supposition cannot be made without some painful reflec-134tions: that lord Cornwallis, on his arrival in Bengal, which cannot be computed at less than six months from this period, will find India still involved in war, and that he may be obliged to take the field in person. If that be well founded, it gives us but a melancholy prospect of the state of our affairs in that quarter. I do not perceive that the bill gives lord Cornwallis any new or extraordinary powers; and, if it did, I should not be inclined to oppose it, for two reasons; first, because I should think it not at all unlikely that the exigency of the case might require such powers; and then, because I know of no person among those who have acted in great stations in my time, whom I should be more ready to trust with great power, than my lord Cornwallis. Judging of him by all his public conduct, I am convinced that power may be safely trusted in his hands, and that he will never use it but for the benefit of the public service. Ifmyvoice could contribute to his honour, he should have it without reserve, for the spirit that prompts him to undertake such a task, as I know it to be, and at such a time; and if it were possible to give him support in the execution of it by any effort of mine, he might be sure of it.

His plan was partially adopted in the volunteering from the militia in 1799, in which case the enlistment was for a definite term of 5 years, and during the war. There was no provision to that effect in the present bill, and that was his principal reason for voting against it on the second reading.

He would not admit that the bill would be a tax on the landed interest. The militia was originally, however, more a taxation on the landed interest than on any other. It was a wrong idea to suppose that the militia was raised for its own defence merely; for what would be our situation, if. on the call of danger, the York or Lincoln militia were to refuse to serve any where but in its own county? For these reasons, he thought the bill neither unconstitutional, unjust, nor oppressive. As to what was said of its being a breach of faith, it was not that, but a commutation. Still he admitted that nothing could justify the measure but the necessity of the case.

It was stated to be one of imperious necessity; but if so, that necessity should be proved, and then every objection, though even of a much stronger nature, would give way before it. He did not suppose that it would abate the ardour of the militia officers in the defence of their country, but some great necessity should be shewn for the adoption of a measure, by which, without that, their feelings must be wounded. Under the present circumstances he must oppose it, as impolitic and unjust, although, if otherwise, he should take pride in turning over to the regulars such men as appeared most likely to obtain most distinctions in the field of battle. He could not approve the policy of this change, which could not give us an offensive force, while the threatened danger of the country required that the men should be kept at home. He was indeed sure, that the whole force and talents of the country should be concentered for its protection, but that should always be done with a proper reference to our mild constitution. In the year 1799, there existed great political necessity, as we had then a gallant army, critically circumstanced in an enemy's country, and for the purpose of rescuing and preserving that brave army, he should not oppose any practicable method, if such could be found, of transporting not only the militia, but the whole population of the country, for its relief. This plan, therefore, did not bring an accession of 17,000 men to our offensive force, but transferred them from one branch of defensive force to another; and that in a manner calculated to produce dissatisfaction and disunion in the service. It should not be lost sight of, that in its present state, the militia was a great defensive force, created by the parliament, and so formed, as to be a check against any such improvident or ruinous enterprise, or expeditions of the ministers, if any such were meditated. To deprive the people of such a force, raised from themselves, and for their own defence, was as unjust as it was impolitic. Such varying systems, from day137to day welt inconsistent with stable maxims and principles of any country, and rendered it impossible to depend upon any expectations which might afterwards be conceived of them; whereas, by adhering to some steady and permanent military system, this country, considering, the spirit that now actuated it, would he enabled to keep up an army of transcendent excellence.", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-frankland", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

This measure, if it was disagreeable to the militia colonels, was brought upon them by themselves.

Before he should call the attention of the house to the particulars of the statement made by his right hon. friend, he must protest against, and even censure the habit of anticipating the revenue in Ireland, long before it was received in the treasury. Much inconvenience arose from this practice, and he believed a great deal of injury likewise resulted from it to the country.&#x2014;He could not refrain from lamenting that balances to an enormous amount should be constantly left in the hands of the collectors. It was in vain, therefore, that we looked for a productive revenue, whilst this anticipation and its consequent evils afflicted the country, and interfered with the application of the taxes in the most suitable ways. He did not think that it was necessary to raise any new taxes under the present circumstances of Ireland, or that any ground of necessity had been made out for them. From the review he had taken of the financial state of that country, however unfavourable it appeared, he thought he could satisfy the house that his proposition was well founded. His right hon. friend calculated the Revenue at 4,000,000l. the Loan at 3,500,000l. and gave credit for 800,354l. Now the whole of the sum to be raised amounting to no more than 8,464,983l. it struck him that any additional taxes were quite unnecessary; and he put it to the candour of the house whether they should be imposed. He said that the proposed taxes were unnecessary, because there remained due to the treasury of Ireland a great deal more than was sufficient for covering the13deficiency, and the sums to which he alluded were the balances in the hands of the collectors, the revenues still due, and the arrears of the quit-rents, which amounted to 1,129,000l. The house would be astonished to hear, that the balances which remained last year in the hands of the collectors were no less than 500,000l. He did not reckon much, however, on the greater part of this, as he supposed a great deal of it could never be recovered, and the rest at a considerable expense. The next source which he should propose for the supply would be, the surplus of the consolidated fund taken at 264,619l. and the profit of the Irish Lottery rated at 100,000l. The postage of letters he should also reckon at 14,000l. The extraordinaries, or the expenses thus termed, if well regulated, would, he was convinced, add considerably to the means of the country; he meant, by not being at all times a considerable and weighty drawback on its resources. There was one branch under the head of extraordinaries, which, he trusted, would be restricted: he meant the gain to this country, and the consequent loss to Ireland, on transmitting money to the Irish Treasury. Here the hon. gent. noticed the nature of the late loan, and the disproportioned exchange at which it was sent to Ireland. The hon. gent. also took a close view of the relative situation of both countries, and the balance of their respective debts, with a contrast of what should be the proportion of each, according to the Articles of the Union: 30,000,000 due by Ireland on the 1st of March, 1802, were in proportion to 469,800,000. due by England, as one to 15. When the debt of England was 469,800,000l. the debt of Ireland should be 62,640,000l. in order to make it equal to it in the proportion of 7&#x00BD; to one.&#x2014;58,926,356l. debt of Ireland were in proportion to 484,962,632l. debt due by England, nearly as 1 to 8, and some fractions. To make the debt of Ireland equal to that of England, in the proportion of 7&#x00BD; to 1, it should be 64,555,172l. The hon. gent. proceeded at great length, and concluded with expressing a most ardent wish that the affairs of Ireland were before the house. The real condition of that country would convince gentlemen that its ability to pay its proportion of the joint expences of the empire had been totally over-rated. What the motive for this could have been he knew not, unless it proceeded from vanity, or interested motives in those who were concerned in the arrangement which brought it about. Ireland was14literally a bankrupt at the time of the Union, and had been getting worse ever since; it was obvious, therefore, that Ireland could not discharge her share of the unequal contract entered into for her, and of course that England should ultimately pay all. He contended, that by borrowing so much money this year, Ireland increased the proportion of its debt compared with that of England, and of course must extend the time for equalising the burthens, which was proposed by the Act of Union. He again insisted that there would be no occasion for flew taxes in that country, if the government should call in the arrears now in the hands of the collectors of the revenue, and said he was determined to give his negative to the resolution.", "author_id": "/people/mr-james-fitzgerald-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

The noble lord pressed upon the consideration of the house, that auctions were already subject to a tax of from 10 to 12 per cent. and that small traders, who generally disposed of their goods in that way, and distressed persons who were often obliged to have recourse to it, would be much affected by the proposed addition.

It was surely full time that those accounts should be settled, as the committee formerly appointed had only met two or three times, and came to no determination. He expressed very strong objections to the proposed tax upon the importation of timber, as, whatever may be the case in the county of Louth, or those parts of Ireland with which the right hon. gent.(Mr. Foster) was best acquainted, it would operate very injuriously to the comforts of all the cottagers in those parts of Ireland with which he was particularly connected, where native timber was so scarce that they were obliged to have recourse entirely to such as was imported.&#x2014; Notwithstanding this necessity, he was sorry to observe that the tax upon timber was regularly augmented every year since the Union.", "author_id": "/people/sir-simon-newport", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

The right hon. gent. had stated that the cash balances in the hands of the collectors was no less than 550,000l.; and to shew that he distinctly meant cash balances, he compared them with the amount of the balance in the hands of the collectors in England, which was oily 37,000l. Whereas, if he had. meant the balance in charge against the Irish collectors, he would have compared it with the arrears of duties in England, which amounts to between 5 and 6 millions. The right hon. gent. now admitted that the cash balance in the hands of the collectors, instead of 550,000l. was only 130,000l. With regard to the increase of the export of linen, it was circumstance that gave him great satisfaction; but he could not attribute that increase to the taking off the duty, because of 37 millions of yards exported from Ireland, 35 millions was imported into English which did not pay the duty; and the quantity of Irish linen exported to foreign countries from Gr. Britain was not above one-fourth of the quantity of British16linen exported; he could therefore by no means conceive that the taking off the duty was the cause of the increase which the right hon. gent. had mentioned. With respect to the great increase of the debt of Ireland last year, he begged to observe, that out of the loan of last year he had paid off 1,700,000l. of exchequer bills, of which 700,000l. were outstanding when he came into office. This sum, when added to the balance remaining in the exchequer, made a sum of 2 millions, over and above the expenditure of the year.

and your Petitioners most humbly trust, that the religious doctrines, which permit such tests to be taken, will be pronounced by this honourable house to be entitled to a toleration, not merely partial, but complete, under the happy constitution and government of this realm; and that his majesty's Roman Catholic subjects, holding those principles, will be considered as subjects upon whose fidelity the state may repose the firmest reliance. \"Your Petitioners further most humbly shew, that 26 years have now elapsed since their most gracious sovereign and the honourable houses of parliament in Ireland, by their public and deliberate act, declared, that, \"from the uniform peaceable behaviour of the Roman Catholics of Ireland for a long series of years, it appeared reasonable and expedient to relax the disabilities and incapacities under which they laboured, and that it must tend not only to the cultivation and improvement of this kingdom, but to the prosperity and strength of all his majesty's dominions, that his majesty's .subjects of all denominations should enjoy the blessings of a free constitution, and should be bound to each other by mutual interest and mutual affection;\" a declaration founded upon unerring principles of justice and sound policy, which still remains to be carried, into full effect faithough your Petitioners are impressed with a belief, that the apprehensions which retarded its beneficial operation previous to the union cannot exist in the parliament of the united kingdom). \"For your Petitioners most humbly shew, that, by virtue of divers statutes100now in force, his majesty's Roman Catholic subjects, who form so great a proportion of the population of Ireland, and contribute so largely to the resources of the state, do yet labour under many incapacities, restraints, and privations, which affect them with peculiar severity in almost every station of life; that more especially they are denied the capacity of sitting or voting in either of the honourable houses of parliament; the manifold evils consequent upon which incapacity they trust it is unnecessary to unfold and enumerate to this honourable house. \"They are disabled from holding or exercising (unless by a special dispensation) any corporate office whatsoever in the cities or towns in which they reside; they are incapacitated and disqualified from holding or exercising the offices of sheriffs and sub-sheriffs, and various offices of trust, honour, and emolument in the state, in his majesty's military and naval service, and in the administration of the laws, in this their native land. \"Your Petitioners, declining to enter into the painful detail of the many incapacities and inconveniencies avowedly inflicted by those statutes upon his majesty's Roman Catholic subjects, beg leave, however, most earnestly to solicit the attention of this hon. house, to the humiliating and ignominious system of exclusion, reproach, suspicion, which those statutes generate and keep alive. \"For your Petitioners most humbly shew, that in consequence of the hostile spirit thereby sanctioned, their hopes of enjoying even the privileges, which through the benignity of their most gracious sovereign, they have been capacitated to enjoy, are nearly altogether frustrated, insomuch that they are, in effect, shut out from almost all the honours, dignities, and offices of trust and emolument in the state, from rank and distinction in his majesty's army and navy, and even from the lowest situations and franchises in the several cities and corporate towns throughout his majesty's dominions. \"And your petitioners severely feel, that this unqualified interdiction of those of their communion from all municipal stations, from the franchises of all guilds and corporations, and from the patronage and benefits annexed to those situations, is an evil not terminating in itself for they beg leave to state, that, by giving an advantage over those of their communion to others, by whom such situations are ex-101clusively possessed, it establishes a species of qualified monopoly, universally operating in their disfavour, contrary to the spirit, and highly detrimental to the freedom of trade. \"Your Petitioners likewise severely feel, that his majesty's Roman Catholic subjects, in consequence of their exclusion from the offices of sheriffs and sub-sheriffs, and of the hostile spirit of those statutes, do not fully enjoy certain other inestimable privileges of the British constitution, which the law has most jealously maintained and secured to their fellow subjects. \"Your Petitioners most humbly beg leave to solicit the attention of this hon. house to the distinction which has conceded the elective, and denies the representative franchise to one and the same class of his his majesty's subjects; which detaches from property its proportion of political power under a constitution whose vital principle is the union of the one with the other; which closes every avenue of legalized ambition against those who must be presumed to have great credit and influence among the mass of the population of the country; which refuses to peers of the realm all share in the legislative representation, either actual or virtual; and renders the liberal profession of the law to Roman Catholics a mere object of pecuniary traffic, despoiled of its hopes and of its honours. \"Your Petitioners further most humbly shew, that the exclusion of so numerous and efficient a portion of his majesty's subjects as the Roman Catholics of this realm from civil honours and offices, and from advancement in his majesty's army and navy, actually impairs, in a very material degree, the most valuable resources Of the British empire, by impeding his majesty's general service, stifling the most honourable and powerful incentives to civil and military merit, and unnecessarily restricting the exercise of that bright prerogative of the crown, which encourages good subjects to promote the public welfare, and excites them to meritorious actions, by a well regulated distribution of public honours and rewards. \"Your Petitioners beg leave most humbly to submit, that those manifold incapacities, restraints, and privations, are absolutely repugnant to the liberal and comprehensive principles recognized by their most gracious sovereign and the parliament of Ireland: that they are impolitic102restraints upon his majesty's -prerogative&#x2014;that they are hurtful and vexatious to the feelings of a loyal and generous people&#x2014;and that the total abolition of them will be found not only compitible with, but highly conduci[...]to, the perfect security of every establishment religious or political, now existing in this realm. \"For your Petitioners most explicitly declare, that they do not seek or wish, in the remotes degree, to injure or encroach upon \"the rights, privileges, immunities, possessions, or revenues appertaining to the bishops and clergy of the protestant religion, as by law established, or to the churches committed to their charge, or to any of them\"&#x2014;the sole object of your petitioners being an equal participation, upon equal terms with their fellow-subjects, of the full benefits of the British laws and constitution. \"Your Petitioners beg leave most humbly to observe, that although they might well and justly insist upon the firm and unabated loyalty of his majesty's Roman Catholic subjects to their most gracious sovereign, their profound respect for the legislature, and their dutiful submission to the laws, yet they most especially rest their humble claims and expectations of relief upon the clear and manifest conduciveness of the measure which they solicit to the general and permanent tranquillity, strength and happiness of the British empire. And your Petitioners, entertaining no doubt of its final accomplishment, from its evident justice and utility, do most solemnly assure this hon. house, that their earnest solicitude for it, at this peculiar crisis, arises principally from their anxious desire to extinguish all motives to disunion, and all means of exciting discontent. \"For your Petitioners humbly state it as their decided opinion, that the enemies of the British empire, who meditate the subjugation of Ireland, have no hope of success, save in the disunion of its inhabitants; and therefore it is, that your Petitioners are deeply anxious, at this moment, that a measure should be accomplished which will annihilate the principles of religious animosity, and animate all descriptions of his majesty's subjects in an enthusiastic defence of the best constitution that has ever yet been established. \"Your Petitioners, therefore, most humbly presume to express their earnest, but respectful hope, that this hon. house will in its wisdom and liberality, deem the se-103veral statutes, now in force[...]ainst them, no longer necessary to be re[...]tined; and that his majesty's loyal and dutiful subjects, professing the Roman Catholic religion, may be effectually relieved from the operation of those statutes, and that so they may be restored to the full enjoyment of the benefits of the British[...]nstitution, and to every inducement of[...]achment to that constitution, equally[...]in common with their fellow subjects throughout the British empire.

It was, however, some satisfaction to him to discover, that there were various ways of avoiding this imposition; and he could assure the hon. gent. that he should not pay one farthing to the tax, from the duty he felt to provide for his family. He would say nothing of the distress of the times, of the calamities during war, of the aggravated system of taxation; he did not wish to oppose the minister, but he flattered himself, in resisting this tax, he did him an essential service. He had formerly read a book, entitled, \"Private Vices, Public Benefits,\" and the advantages of general intoxication were insisted on in that work as a great source of national revenue. The waste and profusion of a general election were likewise contended for as conducive to the public interests, by enlarging the income of the state. It was on some such principles that the present tax could be justified. The inequality of the tax was another objection. It was peculiarly directed against the ill-favoured, and against the ancient maiden, against the diseased, the lame, and the blind. These were more properly objects of pity, than of taxation. If the tax were to be imposed, the two first years of the income of it ought to he laid out in hospitals and nunneries, that the objects of it might be permitted to starve decently.

Again, fathers seeing the consequence, of this tax, would leave the fortunes of their younger children to the duty, fidelity, and honour of the eldest, who would provide for his brethren according to the wishes of his deceased parent.

{"date": ["1805", "mar", "22"], "content": "observed, that if he was disposed to enter at large into the bill before the house, the speech of the right honourable gentleman furnished him. argument enough to prove the injustice of the tax. The general heir of landed property was exempt from its operation, whilst personal property was subject to it. He did not disapprove of the exemption, but he must say, that a direct tax on capital (as this was) would necessarily discourage that enterprising spirit in commerce which was so essential to its extension. He considered the tax also objectionable in a mixed monarchy like ours, in which the Aristocracy constituted one of the branches; but this must be sustained by property, for without it there would be little importance attached to rank. But, said the right honourable gentleman, (Mr. Pitt) landed property is not chargeable 'with this ditty; he agreed that it was not chargeable in words; but was it not so in substance? The right honourable gentleman referred to the prudence and tenderness of fathers, and argued that they would leave the legacies to younger children free from this tax. If they did so, how was it to be done? By charging the amount of this tax on the legacies granted, to the estate of the eldest son. Thus it was evident from the words of the chancellor of the exchequer, that the operation of the tax would be eventually on landed property. He contended, therefore, that the house ought to pause and reflect seriously before it acceded to a measure, which, by indirect wording, would have the effect of a positive duty on the land throughout the kingdom. He begged to remind the right honourable gentleman, that taxes of this description had been always censured by those who had written and thought most upon subjects of this kind; it should not be forgotten that they ascribed the imposing of them to evident symptoms94of a decline; this is was not only true in the abstract, but confirmed by the experiences of ages, and the history of those countries Which fell to rise no more. But if he objected to the bill on this ground, he was still more averse to it in a political view. In a mixed government, like this, the credit of an hereditary aristocracy could only be kept up by great possessions and extensive influence. These possessions and this influence were both attacked by the bill, which, for the first time, attached to legacies of land, as well as to personal property. Such taxes had ever been condemned by the wisest political economists. They had always been considered as evidences, when resorted to, of a declining state. He hoped and trusted that such was not yet the situation of this country; but it was impossible for any considerate man to see such taxes introduced without a considerable degree of anxiety. The tax was one of the most glaring inequality. It was indeed a direct tax on misfortune, and calculated to aggravate affliction. Every fresh death called forth its operation; and it was impossible to say how often or to what amount it might be paid. The right honourable gentleman's argument, therefore, of the smallness of the sum to be paid, was altogether nugatory. He fully entered into all that had been said about the hardships to which it would subject a younger brother. The right honourable gentleman had said, that if their portion was in land they would not be called on to pay. This was mere evasion; for every one knew that small divisions of land were not nearly so valuable, and therefore the younger brothers would have a strong temptation to sell their shares, even at a very disadvantageous price. But the right honourable gentleman had further contended, that a small additional sum would cover the tax, and remove the difficulty complained of. What was this but in other words to say, that the land was to pay the tax, and if so, why did not the right honourable gentleman propose the tax in this direct form? He strongly condemned the bill, as establishing a monstrous difference between heirs by settlement, and heirs by birth and consanguinity. This was an objection which had great weight in his mind. It was contrary to every principle of justice to place those on a worse footing, who derived their rights from nature, than those which arose out of positive appointment. The honourable member then replied to the defence of the right honourable gentleman, grounded on the smallness of the imposition. He said, with much artifice the principle of95this tax had been enforced upon the house, and the intention seemed evidently to be, to carry its operation much farther, so that neither the monied, nor the landed interest, could be able to ascertain what new sacrifices would be required under the pretence of supplying the demands of the state.", "author_id": "/people/mr-charles-grey-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

He began by stating, that by the law and constitution of the country, all the rights of war62were vested entirely in the crown, and no individual had any claims on account of captures; and that the rights of that sort which individuals could claim, flowed from the bounty of his majesty, and his predecessors, and immediately proceeded from the spontaneous declaration of his majesty at the commencement of every war, which not only gave to the captors a right, but which also regulates the distribution of the prizes among them. The acts, he said, which regulate this subject, respect either, 1. the persons to be entitled to the property: 2. the functions of the courts to decide on its appropriation: 3. the management of the property during the process, and the distribution of it after it has been adjudged. With regard to the first, the provisions of the act vary in their application, according to the peculiar circumstances and situation of the parties. With respect to the second, immediately affecting the constitution and dignities of the civil courts, the legislature has been extremely tender of interposing its authority, and introducing new regulations. It has considered, that the courts of Admiralty are not restricted within the narrow limits of municipal institution: the law of nature, and of nations, is the foundation on which they build; all the subjects of foreign states, on the general principles of justice and humanity, have a right to redress for injuries received upon the high seas, and look for protection to these establishments. The rights of parties grounded on these enlarged principles, are not less sacred than those which are erected on the solid basis of the common law of England; and the character and honour of every country, in a great measure, depends on the regard which is paid to the just demands of individuals, placed in the most remote regions of the world. There are three. modes in which the business of prize .agency may be conducted:&#x2014;1st. by a public officer: 2d. by persons selected by parties interested: 3d. by a mixed mode, in which both these are comprised.&#x2014;The mode now pursued is the second I have named, and it has many recommendations, although the trust necessarily reposed has been liable to very serious abuses. When we consider the number of persons, respectable for their characters and for their property, who have been engaged:in this business, we need not be surprised that agents of that description have received abundant encouragement. The great question is, if, under the violation of private ,right to which, in this mode of agency, in-63dividuals have been exposed, it would be eligible that public official men should interpose; and in our consideration of this, we are naturally led to enquire into the principal matters which effect the interest! of the parties. First; the security of the property is the great object; it is better that it should be forthcoming, however late, than that it should be wholly lost. While the decison is witheld, it is material that the fund should be accumulating, for the advantage of those who shall be declared entitled to it. Should the property be invested in real securities? Certainly not; because, from the nature of those securities, it would he liable to be empounded a considerable time posterior to the decision, when the parties might want to apply the property to advance their interests in their own private concerns. If it cannot be invested in real securities, much less can it he dependant on the risk of personal security, or submitted to the hazards of trade; even in its application to the public funds of the state, some respect is to be paid to private opinion and convenience, under the vicissitudes of national affairs. During one of the more atrocious periods of the-French Revolution, if any distinction may be made in the political profligacy of that republic, it was the practice to invest one of the officers on board every ship with the functions of a Judge of the Admiralty, and by this means, instantly that a capture was made, the prize was condemned, and an immediate distribution was made among the successful depredators.&#x2014; We are not, however, here governed by the laws of Algerine piracy, or the institutions of revolutionized France. England must act with good faith to every individual wherever he resides; documents must be procured, and all the parties must be heard. Delays have been complained of in our court, and in some respects, and to a certain extent, they are unavoidable. To give the parties an opportunity of .appeal is necessary, and this is one sourer; of delay. It is well known, that the general law of Europe has assigned the interval of a year and a day to the appellant. To prevent procrastination, the term of appeal was for some time limited to three months, but. however good the intention might be in this regulation, the legislature found it necessary to trace back its own steps. Appellants in America, in Asia, or even in the remote parts of Europe, had not sufficient time to resist, the decision they thought inequitable, thy, former interval for appeals was64again conceded. The object then has been, during the delay, to make the effects speedily productive, and to attend to the accommodation of each party as much as possible. If security were the only object, the delivery of the property into the hands of a public officer under the mandate of the the court, would be sufficient. In any new regulation on the subject of this question, however prudently formed, we cannot exclude all inconveniences. In considering the defects of the present system, we have the satisfaction to discern, that they are neither great nor numerous. The late act, which is the present law on the subject, contains many provisions; some of which I shall shortly state, in order to spew, that the evils we apprehend are not gigantic and formidable. Previous to this act, the prize agents gave no security for the faithful discharge of their duties. Now they are required to give security to the sum of 5000l. Under former statutes, agents might keep in their own hands the monies they received during the progress of a cause; now the captors may compel the agents to vest the proceeds in public securities, until the proper time of distribution. Formerly, mariners could only recover their shares by tedious proceedings in the courts of law or equity; now they may attain their right by a short and summary proceeding in the court of admiralty. Under the former acts, the charges of the agents were not submitted to examination and controul; now they may be inspected and reduced, when they are unreasonable, at a very small expence to the parties. At this time, the agent is obliged to remit the balance due on the prizes to the navy pay-office, where, as formerly, he could retain the money in his own hands. Heretofore, there was no provision for the payment of monies on the account of prizes, after the appointed time of such payment, so that persons absent, either on their private affairs, or on public duty, on their return, were frequently disappointed of the rewards due to their exertions and their gallantry: now, for two days in each week, the office of the agent is required to be kept open, for the purpose of answering to these claims. Under the prior forms, the prize-money was disposed of without regularity; now there must be a power of attorney for each captor. Thus it would be seen that much had been done to remove the evils, and to prevent the impositions to which a meritorious class of men were exposed. These regulations, then, deserve65the attention of the house in the formation of any new plan to counteract the disadvantages which the wisdom of parliament, from the nature of the concern, has not yet been able to remove. One great cause of detriment has been from their ignorance of the parties interested in the provisions under the late act, which have been made in their favour. If they do not know what is their situation in this respect, it is precisely the same as if no such prudent and humane regulations had been made. It is proverbial in our courts, that \"the law is made for those who are awake, not for those who are asleep.\" It has occurred to me, as the means of preventing the mischievous effects from the ignorance and inactivity of claimants, tat curators or guardians be appointed to enforce the provisions of the act. These may have full opportunities of acquiring information, and may communicate the result of their judgment on the legislative regulations, as applicable to the particular cases, to the parties themselves. This seems to me to be an obvious and practical remedy for most of the mischiefs from the cause to which I have adverted. In addition to this, some supplementary arrangements may be introduced with great propriety at the principal ports of the kingdom. It might be asked, if what I have proposed be consistent with what has been recommended by the commissioners of naval enquiry? It is perhaps unnecessary minutely to enter into this comparison in the present stage of the business; enough surely has been shewn, both in the present exposition of the law, and in the general notoriety of the facts, for the house to form some competent judgment on the fitness of bringing this measure under consideration.&#x2014;The hon. and learned gent. concluded with moving, \"that leave be given to bring in a bill for the encouragement of seamen, and for the more effectual manning of his majesty's ships.\"&#x2014;The question was immediately put from the chair, and agreed to.&#x2014;Adjourned.", "author_id": "/people/sir-william-scott-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

It was impossible therefore to put off this question, without some farther investigation; there were ample precedents in the house to authorise it to go into such investigation, and the arguments used against it, by noble lords on the other side, were not founded either upon law, upon justice, or upon principle, but were merely a detail of minute distinctions wholly unworthy consideration; he, therefore, trusted their lordships would be allowed to receive that assistance from precedents, and that a committee for that purpose might be appointed.", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-grenville", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},

{"date": ["1805", "mar", "19"], "content": "rose, and spoke as follows: Sir, in pursuance of the notice I gave some time since, I shall now submit a motion to this house respecting Mr. Fordyce; a gentleman who, by various documents of parliament, appears indebted to the public in a very large sum of money, and of a very long standing; and who likewise appears by a commission lately issued by the crown, and a copy of which now lies upon your table, to be one of five commissioners appointed for the purpose of carrying into execution most important reforms in the department of the navy, which have been suggested by the parliamentary commissioners appointed by this house to examine into those subjects. The first object I have in view is an inquiry into the circumstances of Mr. Fordyce's debt; into the engagement he has entered into for the discharge of it; into the security the public have for its final payment; and into the causes that have hitherto delayed its liquidation; and, with reference to these points, I will shortly state to the house the history of Mr. Fordyce's debt to the public, as I collect it from the different documents of parliament. The house knows, that by an act of parliament passed in the year 1780, certain commissioners were appointed for the purpose of examining the public accounts of the kingdom, and for other salutary purposes of reform. In the first report of those commissioners, and which was likewise made in 1780, 1 perceive that Mr. Fordyce was found to be indebted to the public, at that time, in the sum of 64,000l. and upwards, as receiver general of the land-tax of Scotland. An examination of that gentleman upon oath, taken before the commissioners, as to the means of liquidating that debt, appears in the appendix to that report; and Mr. Fordyce there refers to the most positive and precise stipulations, as having been entered into by him with the lords of the treasury, for the accomplishing that object. He states, that he had agreed to pay off 30,000l. before the then next Lady-day; 10,000l. before the 10th of the next month after; and that as to the remaining 24,000l. owing to particular circumstances, Mr. Fordyce states, he had obtained the indulgence from the lords of the treasury to pay that sum by instalments of 5000l. per annum. This, sir, was in the year 1780. The next mention I find of Mr. Fordyce is in the 8th49report of the finance committee in 1797; that committee, the house likewise knows, was appointed for the purpose of examining abuses in the expenditure of public money; and it certainly does appear a most extraordinary circumstance, that, after the report of the commissioners in 1780, that I have before mentioned, after all the engagements on the part of Mr. Fordyce I have before referred to, and after a period of 17 years to fulfil those engagements in, it does, I say, appear a most extraordinary thing, that Mr. Fordyce's balance to the public should make the prominent feature of complaint it does in that report of the committee of finance. It appears from that report, that although Mr. Fordyce was so much in arrear in 1780, he was nevertheless continued in his office of receiver general until 1783; and when, instead of his former engagements being fulfilled, and his former balance reduced, his debt at that time to the public amounted to upwards of 90,000l. At this period, in 1783, it appears he was dismissed; and the report proceeds to state, that from that period (in 1783) to the then present time, (in 1797) the whole of that arrear of 90,000l. with the exception of 700l. only paid in July 1797, had remained a debt due from Mr. Fordyce to the public, for which no interest whatever had been received. I find, sir, from the appendix to that report, that Mr. Fordyce upon this occasion, as upon the former one, appeared again before the committee, and again referred them to new engagements entered into by him with the lords of the treasury, for the payment of at least 4,000l. annually, and to a variety of securities, that were to produce the speedy liquidation of this debt; and I particularly beg to call the attention of the house to one statement made in the appendix to that report. It is stated, that in 1783 Mr. Fordyce's property was all assigned to trustees for the lords of the treasury as a security for the debt, but that it had at the same time been agreed, that Mr. Fordyce should retain the possession and management of his estate, subject to the direction and controul of the lords of the treasury, and lord advocate of Scotland. This, no doubt, sir, was meant as a beneficial arrangement for the public; that the skill and management of Mr. Fordyce might make his property more productive than it would be in the hands of the trustees; the experience, however, sir, of two and twenty years, must very much diminish, if not entirely extinguish, all our, reliance upon the skill of Mr. Fordyce, and50the controul of the lords of the treasury and the lord advocate of Scotland; for, during that period of two and twenty years, they have not produced one farthing to the public. The only sum paid since the finance committee's report, notwithstanding all the new engagements on behalf of Mr. Fordyce, and all the numerous securities he refers to, has been a sum of 8,250l. and this sum I find was given to Mr. Fordyce by parliament, out of the public money, for surveying woods in Scotland; and being in the exchequer, could not with much decency be paid out of it, to a person so much its debtor as Mr Fordyce. This sum was paid by Mr. Fordyce, or rather retained by the treasury in Feb. 1800; and during the 5 years that have since elapsed, no other payments whatever have been made. These last facts, respecting Mr. Fordyce's debt since 1797, I collect from the annual return of the balances of public defaulters, which is now laid before parliament, in pursuance of the act of 1800, for which the public, sir, are indebted to you. This, sir, then, is the parliamentary history of Mr. Fordyce's debt to the public: he now owes to them upwards of 80,000l.; he has owed it two and twenty years; the money came out of the pockets of the people for their taxes; a sum more than equal to the principal has been lost in the way of interest for this sum; no engagement of this gentleman for the liquidation of this debt seems to have been performed; no steps appear to have been taken by the lords of the treasury to accelerate the liquidation of this debt, although it has been so strongly pressed upon their attention by the commissioners report in 1780, and that of the finance committee in 1797, and although they are said to be in possession of so many and such valuable securities. I am sure, sir, the house must agree with me, that this statement of facts calls for a committee of this house to examine what these securities are that have been so long unproductive; what this property of Mr. Fordyce's is, that, after two and twenty years trial, neither his own Skill, nor the controul of the lords of the treasury, and the lord advocate of Scotland, can convert into any thing for the public. It cannot be said, I apprehend, that this gentleman is destitute of means to liquidate his debt to the public; if I am rightly informed, sir, he is in possession of a large estate in Scotland, that it made his qualification to sit in the present parliament for Berwick, that it enabled him to succeed in a very hard-fought contest for that borough,51and that he finally lost his seat in this house only from having been proved to have been too lavish of his money. Can it be said, after this, that Mr. Fordyce's estates Yield no rent? or, if they do, why have not the lords of the treasury, in their discretion and controul, prevented this public money from being thus squandered on a Berwick election? Sir, I hope I should be as backward as any gentleman in this house to press for any thing like persecution; I am willing to admit, as I did on a former occasion, that, from all I have heard, I believe it to be true that there was much misfortune in this gentleman's case originally; I am ready to admit, that it would be ungenerous to urge the public to withhold all reasonable indulgence in cases of allowed misfortune; but there must naturally be a limit to such indulgence, there must be a decency in the use of it; and, above all, there must be an impartiality in the distribution of it to persons similarly situated. There are many unfortunate debtors to the public besides Mr. Fordyce; many who, as securities for their principals only, are harrassed without pity by all the rigorous process of the crown. It is just and right that the laws of the country should be equally and impartially administered; and, of course, it is not right that Mr. Fordyce and his property should make the exception they do to the ordinary application of the law. Besides, sir, as I have said before, we are never to forget that the money Mr. Fordyce owes to the public came out of the pockets of the people for their taxes, that through him or his agents it has hitherto been lost, and that it is not very gracious to the people of England, whilst we are taxing the very sources of their existence, to be granting this exclusive compassion to Mr. Fordyce. Sir, it is not only the estate I have mentioned that Mr. Fordyce possesses as a means to satisfy his debt, the public knows that this gentleman enjoys a very lucrative office under the crown, and that fie has long done so; they know, sir, that the revenue, which has already lost so much by him, has been further burdened, for the purpose of building him a house of great magnificence, nominally, indeed, an office, but in fact a private residence, and built at great expence; and knowing as they do these facts, and feeling as they do the increasing pressure of an almost overbearing taxation, it is insulting the people of England to call upon them for any extraordinary sympathy in the case of Mr. Fordyce. As I said, sir, upon a former occasion, I can take no blame to myself for52making these observations, unpleasant as they are: the ministers have forced Mr. Fordyce upon the criticism of the public, and they must answer to him for the consequences; if, after two and twenty years forbearance, they still think themselves justified in withholding the process of the crown against Mr. Fordyce for the recovery of their public debt, they are at least hound in duty and decency to the public, not to exhibit Mr. Fordyce in any character of discretion or controul connected with the public revenue of the country. I am sure, sir, this is a sentiment universally felt by the public; and, what is more, it was a sentiment recognized and acted upon by the chancellor of the exchequer, who dismissed Mr. Fordyce from his office. The chancellor of the exchequer I allude to was lord J. Cavendish; and that noble person himself seems to have believed, that there had been much misfortune in Mr. Fordyce's case, so much so, that he was induced to promise him some indulgence as to time, and some place of profit, instead of the one he had deprived him of. But observe, sir, there was a condition annexed to this promise, namely, that the place to be given was to be in no way connected with the revenue:&#x2014;this, sir, was the just and generous sentiment of that noble person of humanity to the individual, and of respect to the feeling and to the interest of the public: if that noble person thought, two and twenty years ago, when Mr. Fordyce's debt was recently contracted, that the employment of him, in any way connected with the revenue, was an act of disrespect and injustice to the public, what would he have thought to have seen Mr. Fordyce now under all the aggravated circumstances of the duration of his debt, and the forfeiture of his engagements, enjoying a place of similar responsibility in the revenue to the one he was deprived of? What would he have thought to have seen this gentleman selected as the person who was to frame and introduce a system of reform and economy into the expenditure of the public money in the department of the navy? What could he have thought if he had, heard the chancellor of the exchequer of the present day pronounce Mr. Fordyce the fittest person that could be found to fill this office of reformer. There is another reason for the house agreeing to the committee I shall finally move for, and which I had omitted to mention: whatever doubts may have been formerly entertained as to public accountants being chargeable with interest,53there can be none now since the act of 1800, for which the public is likewise indebted to you, sir; under this act, there is now 20,000l. added to. Mr. Fordyce's debt, making the sum total 100,000l. and upwards, though I observe by the last return this interest is not added to the principal.&#x2014;This is all that appears to me at present necessary to be said upon the subject of Mr. Fordyce's debt; and I feel certain it will be sufficient to induce the house to accede to the committee I shall finally move for. When I mentioned to the house my intention of bringing this subject forward, I gave notice at the same time of my intention to submit likewise a resolution to the house respecting the impropriety of Mr. Fordyce's appointment as one of the commissioners in the new naval commission issued by the crown; a sentiment that I have by no means abandoned, but which at present I shall forbear from expressing in the form I had intended; if, however, sir, this house has any wish to appear in earnest with the public upon the subject of reform and economy in the expenditure of the public money, it will do well to direct its most anxious and particular attention to this new naval commission, because, under all the circumstances of the case, it is impossible that any thing can be more full of suspicion and alarm. We are all agreed, or at least we all profess to be agreed, that the commissioners appointed under the act of this house to examine into public abuses in the department of the navy, have been eminently successful in detecting and exposing the greatest frauds upon the revenue. An honourable admiral in this house, and who was one of the late board of admiralty, and who of course has had all the means of official information, has asserted, without being contradicted, that if the exposures made by the parliamentary commissioners were to be followed up by corresponding reforms, a third of the public money spent in the extensive department of the navy, might be saved. In times like the present, it is impossible that a discovery of greater importance could be made; but what security have we, sir, for the adoption of such reform? After two years and a half of such labours as, I believe, never parliamentary commissioners bestowed before, after nine volumes of such minute and detailed enquiries as were never made by commissioners before, the only object secured to the public is an alteration made by law in the management of Chatham chest. Sir, L understood that a pledge54was given by the late chancellor of the exchequer to this house, that he would move specific resolutions founded upon these various reports; no such proceeding has, however, taken place, nor is it likely now it should do so; for it is impossible for this house to conceal from itself that the present administration is hostile to that parliamentary commission; many of the gentlemen I see opposite to me resisted, with all their power, the act creating the commission; the admiralty who brought it in are the perpetual subject of their censures, and particularly for their economy. We have seen with what reluctance this parliamentary commission is to be permitted to exist as long as parliament intended it to do, and then, what is worse than all, we see that the reform of all the abuses that the parliamentary commissioners have discovered is not to be left to this house, is not to be followed up by resolutions of parliament, or by positive laws, but the whole is entrusted to commissioners appointed by the crown; that is to say, by ministers themselves; and over which commissioners, parliament has no controul. If parliament give this favourite subject of the public out of its own hands, the reform of abuses, the economy of the public money in the department of the navy, we might have been indulged, I think, with a reformer of more promise than Mr. Fordyce. We know very well, sir, the resolution, the courage, the unimpeachable character that are necessary to make a man a successful reformer, that can enable him to contend against that implacable host of interested jobbers that for ever swarm about the public money; and can it be said that Mr. Fordyce, whose very existence is at the mercy of the crown, whose character as a public defaulter is at the mercy of every man whose abuses he is to correct, can Mr. Fordyce thus situated, be that faithful and rigid servant of the public, which his office of reformer so peculiarly calls upon him to be? Having said thus much of the late naval commission, and of the suspicious light in which I view it, I shall nevertheless afford Mr. Fordyce an opportunity of doing his duty to the public, and I shall not at this present moment submit the resolution I originally intended; I beg, however, to give this notice to the house, that if my suspicions shall be too unfortunately realized, if we shall not shortly hear of the labours of these new commissioners, I shall think it my duty again to call the attention of the house to this sub-55ject, and endeavour to induce it to resume into its own hands this most important object of reform; and I shall now, sir, content myself with moving for a committee of this house, for the purpose of obtaining information respecting Mr. Fordyce's debt, which under all the circumstances of the enormity of that debt, the time it has been owing, the apathy of the lords of the treasury in the recovery of it, and the violation of all Mr. Fordyce's engagements as to the liquidation of it, the house, I apprehend, will have no hesitation in agreeing to. The hon. gentleman then moved, \"that a committee be appointed to examine what sum was now due from John Fordyce, esq. to the public in respect of a sum of 82,000l. and upwards, reported to be due from him by the finance committee in 1797; together with an account of what steps had been taken by the lords of the treasury for the recovery of the same; and also an account of all securities given by the said John Fordyce, or on his behalf, to the lords of the treasury for the payment of the said debt; also an account of all engagements entered into by the said John Fordyce with the lords of the treasury for the payment of the said debt, and of such of them as had been performed; together with an account of all the rent, produce, and profits of the estates and property of any kind whatsoever belonging to the said John Fordyce, and which had been by him conveyed to the lords of the treasury in 1783, as a security for his debt from that period to the present time.\"", "author_id": "/people/mr-thomas-creevey", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

It was not because he thought him unworthy to be trusted, but because he was in a situation of misfortune, and therefore58in a state of dependence on his majesty's ministers. The commission was appointed to make suggestions to government, and might they not have to report on such parts as some at least of his majesty's ministers, might be no friends to? However that might be, he was sure that no man in a state of absolute subjection to the power of ministers, could report with that sturdy, independence which ought to characterize the conduct of a public reformer. He had not the honour of being acquainted with Mr. Fordyce, but he had no doubt of his being a gentleman of talent, ability, and merit. He thought the house ought to be obliged to his hon. friend for having brought forward the business. Neither had Mr. F. any reason to complain that the subject was agitated, inasmuch as it gave him an opportunity of making known those favourable circumstances of his case, which were unknown before. Whether the facts should be laid before the house by motion, or ascertained by the inquiry of a committee, amounted to the same thing; he should therefore not differ from the opposition of the right hon. gent. opposite. He was inclined to agree in the opinion, that the case of Mr. F. was a case of pure misfortune. He had himself a recollection of the failure of the first Agent, Cockburn, who had been so strongly recommended to Mr. Fordyce, and the result of his recollection was, that it afforded a case of very strong equity in favour of Mr. F. As to the case of Mr. Fordyce, the banker, his failure was a misfortune of such an extent, as to produce an effect really astonishing. It would be rather surprising how lie should be able to speak to the circumstances. He had accidentally happened a few days back to read over the copy of a letter from Mr. Garrick to a friend of his in the West Indies, in which it was stated, that the receipts of the theatre had materially fallen off in consequence of the widely diffused effect of the failure of Mr. Fordyce. If the effect of that failure was so great that the pleasures of so great a part of the public were depressed by it in so perceptible a degree, he did not wonder that a person in Mr. Fordyce's situation suffered by it so materially. It appeared, further, that Mr. F. constantly exerted himself to make good his deficiency, but that the circumstances of the times, particularly the unfortunate circumstances respecting Grenada, had prevented his arrangements from proceeding in the manner that was to be desired. From what59was stated, there was reason to believe that in the process of time every thing that could be wished would be done. It was therefore for the benefit of the public that no interruption should be given to Mr. F's management of his means of clearing off the arrears. The facts, however, ought to be laid before the house in a parliamentary way.

He contended, that the loan was made to a larger amount than was necessary, and that if it were even necessary, the interest of it might be defrayed without having recourse to any new taxes. The revenue of Ireland was only taken at 4 millions; though every body knew that it would be considerably more. In the last year, the right hon. gent. (Mr. Foster) imposed additional taxes of 1,150,000l. by way of regulation, and 76,000l. to defray the expences of a direct loan; and he now stated, that there was out of last year's revenue a surplus of 843,000l. but that it must remain locked up in the Irish treasury until the proportion of Ireland to the joint expences of the empire should be paid. Upon this practice of retaining the surplus of the consolidated fund since the union, it would follow, that there must be now a total surplus of about 4 millions applicable to the expences of the year. This was a mode of proceeding very disadvantageous to Ireland. He sacrificed much by opposing the union; but now that it was effected, he considered the two countries as one, and thought they should be treated equally. The sums returned of duties due, but not immediately payable, were to the amount of 636,346l. which either were or ought to be now in the treasury of Ireland. This, as well as the balances in the hands of the collectors, ought to be a productive fund, and if it was not, he must call upon those who promised Ireland so much benefit from the union to put an end to this system of patronage and influence. It was allowed on all hands, to be a very great grievance to that country, and yet, notwithstanding so many complaints, the government had not removed any one of these collectors, though in a man's private concerns he would not allow an agent to pay himself, and also retain an eight part of his himself, and also retain an eighth part of his receipts, unless, on the assurance that the balance was quite safe.&#x2014;He had a right, therefore, to take if for granted, that this was a solvent and sufficient answer, for which reason he should bring it into the amount of the year. He would even venture to ask the right hon. gent. whether he had reason to think that a remission was given of any of these balances32and if he wanted a clue, he would refer to the memorable failure in 1800. These balances were so enormous a grievance, that as long as he had a seat in that house, he should bring the subject annually under the consideration of Parliament. Were these sums available, they would have superseded the necessity of a loan in this country of 2&#x00BD; millions for Ireland, and it would be easy to recede from the plan of borrowing an other million, and to issue government paper in the room of it. Even the four million revenue promised, must be more uncertain under this system, as it must come through the hands of the same bankrupt collectors, who were already so very much in arrear. To prove the hardships Ireland laboured under, he contended, that one of its greatest difficulties arose from the debt it contracted in the year 1800, for the purpose of purchasing the representations of boroughs necessary to be disfranchised for the put, poses of the union.&#x2014;He did not see why this should fall exclusively on Ireland, or why England, which benefitted by the union, should not pay a part of the expences of it.

The instructions to colonel Collins; the instructions to colonel Close; the treaty of Bassein, from which, as it appears to me, the war may be dated; and, finally, the map of India annexed to the papers.", "author_id": "/people/sir-philip-francis", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

It observed, that by the last Salt Duty bill there was a severe penalty laid on all retail shopkeepers who should sell at any thing lower than the standard price, and the same penalty was exacted in that now in its progress. When the present bill was brought in, an officer was sent down to Rotherham, and the places adjoining, to announce the new duty, and take an account of the stock in hand. In consequence of this, the salt manufacturers ceased to sell; but the retail shopkeepers continued to sell; at four-pence halfpenny a quart, as before, for which informations were laid against them to recover the penalties.

In referring to that schedule, he found the duties on spermaccti candles, copper, tar, &c.; raised to seven times their former duties, while rattans, walking sticks, and other inferior articles, experienced a diminution. As to timber, he said the last duty had diminished the consumption so much, since the union, that the revenue on them was 11,000l. The present tax, he thought, would reduce the consumption so much, that the duty would not pay the expence of the collection, and would render the cottages uninhabitable. The want of domestic comforts at home frequently encouraged the inhabitants of the country to idleness and riotous conduct at home. In the south of Ireland, the want of timber was a most grievous hardship, as in the county of Tipperary there were farms to the extent of sometimes 2 miles, without a hedge or bush to be seen upon them. He complained greatly of the want of security to the mails in Ireland, which were sometimes robbed34in the middle of the day by a single man only armed with a stick. The effect of this was that the letters from Waterford to Clonmell were obliged to be sent by special messengers, as none but boys are employed by the post-office. At the general post-office the letters were thrown by carelessly and promiscuously, and accessible to any one who should think proper to call for them. When the letters were sent out, it was usual for the postman to go home first to dinner, and then leave the letters behind him, while he went to a public house; so that if the expectant merchant went to the man's residence, he found the letters lying there totally unprotected; and the bills and notes were very generally either lost or embezzled. The costs of the accountants now were at their own discretion, liable to no check whatever, as there was no person to check them; and such he complained was the case in all the public boards and offices in Ireland.", "author_id": "/people/sir-simon-newport", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

It would not, he set out by observing, be denied, that the state of our immense dominion in the East, was a subject of the highest importance that could be submitted to the consideration of parliament. In proportion, however, as this empire was extended, it seemed to excite less of the attention either of the house or the public. It seemed as if its very greatness bad rendered it superior to the capacity of the house fully to understand or beneficially to regulate. If this really was the case, it was only an additional proof of the impolicy of that all-grasping system which had too long guided our councils in India, only an additional confirmation that such a system must continue to produce consequences of the most disastrous nature. Abuses must, from the very nature of things, spring out of this excessive lost for power. Abuses must arise from the remoteness of our possessions, so little liable to investigation or punishment. But it was fit that the house should bear in mind. that evils which originated in India would not confine themselves to that country. Even at this moment, some of those evils were already felt, and many more would follow in their track. India, under its present government, afforded us no revenue. It was on the contrary there that our resources were consumed in ruinous conquests, that the flower of our troops were cut off, fighting unnecessary battles, India, under a wise system of policy, might be at once a source of revenue and a fund of the most beneficial commerce. Before these effects took place, however, the present system of apathy, with regard to our Indian affairs, must be abandoned for a system of jealousy, of justice, and of moderation. From the conduct of parliament now, with regard to India, it appeared as if her authority to legislate fro that part of226the empire, were absolutely abdicated. From a deep conviction that this system could not long be persisted in, he had risen to call the attention of the house to the subject, as he had felt it his duty to do on many former occasions. Since he had last submitted the consideration of our affairs in India generally to parliament,the constitution of the house had been so much changed, as well as the individuals who composed it, that it became necessary for him to take a short view of our Indian policy, from the time of our first settling there down to the present day, describing briefly the principles which parliament had at different periods laid down for the regulation of our government. In the first place, he had to state the reasons which induced him so often to take up this office;this thankless office, as he had often experienced it. It was in 1773 that his first connection with India originated, when he was sent out by the government or that period to be a member of the supreme council. During a residence of six years in India, his conduct had ever received the strongest marks of approbation; and on his return in 1781 it had undergone the most rigid examination. A committee of the house had examined every act and every opinion which he had delivered while a member of the supreme council; and he was proud in the recollection that the report of that committee was as favourable as even his most sanguine wishes could have desired. It was a report of the most unqualified approbation. Other committees had made similar reports, and after all the inquiry which did take place, he had a right to say, that though not formally tried, he was much on his trial as even Mr. Hastings was, when he was formally arraigned before the highest tribunal in this country. To himself, who had received so little solid advantage from the attention he had bestowed on Indian affairs, it was a consolation to know, that his conduct, and the policy which he had ever recommended, had received the most flattering testmonies.&#x2014;Having said so much respecting the origin of his connection with India, be proceeded to the direct consideration of the question, in doing which he assured gentlemen that they had no occasion to be alarmed by any apprehension of long, dry details. All that he had in contemplation was a bird's-eye view of the business, for that would be fully sufficient for the object he had proposed on the present oc-227casion. There was a great deal of matter in the papers before the house, to which he should not feel it necessary to allude, nor did he now mean to say any thing of those military operations, the details of which were so numerous and intricate. With regard to the Origin of our connection with India, it was hardly necessary for him to remind the house, that it was originally purely commercial, but it was marked on the part of the native princes with every appearance of good understanding, and even kindness. They not only afforded us every facility for carrying on an advantageous trade, but actually conferred on us immunities and exemptions which many of their own subjects did not enjoy. It was, in a mercantile point of view, wise in the native princes to encourage trade with foreign nations. But while their commercial eve was open, their political eye was closed. They did not act on those principles which had so effectually excluded European nations from the dominion of China. It was not till 1765, that our situation in India sustained an important change. Our first connection with Bengal, was in the character of adventurers. Alter that period we began to assume the character of sovereigns. But what was then the language of lord Clive, a man to whom we owe the erection of our immense eastern dominion? His language was, \"my resolution and my hopes will always be to confine our conquests and Our possessions, to Bengal, Bahar, and Orixa. To go farther is, in my opinion, a scheme so extravagantly ambitious and absurd, that no governor and council in their senses can ever adopt it, unless the whole system of the company's interest be first entirely new modelled\".&#x2014; Such was the language of one whose knowledge was unquestioned, and whose policy laid the only Sure foundation of our Indian possessions. He himself knew that the government of that day fully adopted these principles of limited dominion. When in 1773 he went with the other commissioners to India, the government gave the most positive instructions to see that the same Principles were followed up, and the commands of the directors were absolute on the subject. These were principles laid down while a French force had possession of a considerable part of India, and when the idea of undertaking a war for conquest might have appeared some excuse for deviating in a particular case from the gene-228ral system of limitation. But it was not on these declarations that he found himself obliged to rest his opinion. In 1782, parliament unanimously resolved, that the British Empire should not be extended in India, and that no war should be undertaken from a lust of conquest. The same resolution was followed up by an express act of the legislature in 1784; and at the renewal of the charter in 1793, the continuance of the same policy was provided for in the most explicit terms. This general principle was therefore so clearly laid down, that it was absolutely impossible to attempt to controvert it. He was aware that a distinction was attempted to be taken betwixt wars of oppression, which were never to be undertaken, and wars which were founded on justice and necessity. It was not very easy to see on what grounds such a plea was brought forward. Of tile origin or justice of many of the wars in India, the house and the public were Frequently, or rather always, without the means of forming a proper judgment. We had never any evidence but the testimony of one of the Belligerent powers against the other, and therefore such testimony was to be received with diffidence. We knew only in general that wars had been begun, that great acquisitions were made, and we gave ourselves little trouble to ascertain how far they arose, either out of justice or necessity. The native princes of India had no ambassadors to plead their cause. They saw their country overrun, their wealth destroyed, and then they had only the satisfaction of being told that they had been actuated by lawless ambition. Many members might not, perhaps, be aware that there formerly existed in the government of Bengal a commission of Persian correspondence, through which our relations with the native princes were conducted. In looking, however, to the vast body of papers on the table, he had not been able, after the most diligent inquiry, to find above three or four short documents, containing no intelligence of the slightest importance. This correspondence was now, therefore, either altogether abolished, or had for a considerable time been suspended. Thus were the house and the public without means of judging of the origin of contests in India. Our commissioners might be honest persons, and their representations might be frequently founded in fairness and truth. But we were forced to believe them, without knowing what was229the nature of the remonstrances of the native princes, or what sacrifices they had made for the preservation of peace. He desired the house to consider what was the extent of our conquests in India. The hon. member proceeded to read the following list of native princes, who have either been extirpated, or whose states have sunk into ours: Nabob of Bengal, rajah of Benares, nabob of Oude, Rohillas, Ferokabad, nabob of the Carnatic, Tippoo Sultan and Mysore, now under an infant rajah.&#x2014;He then stated the following to be the list of those princes who survive under our government, or are suffered to remain as feeble tributaries.&#x2014;Rajahs of Tanjore, Tinnivelli, Travancore; subadar of the decan by a susidiary treaty made in 1798; Gwicowar and Guzzerat, Bundelcund, the Mogul, in short the whole peninsula from Delhi to Cape Cormorin, except the Mahratta country.&#x2014;But with all this extent of empire, with all that variety of dominion, the thirst of conquest remained unbounded, and the positive law of parliament for the limitation of our territories has been again violated, by a War with the Mahratta powers. The pretext for the war struck him as absurd, and indefensible in the highest degree. There was not the slightest ground for supposing that the Mahrattas entertained any views hostile to our power. It was true, that they were agitated by intestine feuds, but he defied any member, from the papers on the table, to shew that their proceedings could inspire any one with subject for jealousy or alarm. He knew it was common to represent the native princes in the most odious light, as absolute monsters of depravity; but from the language of those employed under the government of lord Wellesley, it was easy to see in what light these descriptions should be considered. To secure the tranquillity of our possessions, it was necessary that a treaty with one of the Mahratta chiefs should be concluded, and the Peshwa was selected for that purpose. Now what is the character of this prince, with whom it is necessary to stand on good terms, to promote our own security? Colonel Palmer says, \"I am to have my last private audience of the Peshwa this evening, when I will make a final effort to convince his highness of the lasting security, power, and prosperity, which he will derive from embracing your lordship's proposals; though I apprehend that nothing short of imminent and certain230destruction will induce him to make concessions which militate against his deep-rooted jealousy and prejudices, and of which he thinks he has already made extraordinary sacrifices.\" Colonel Close says, \"every day's experience tends to strengthen the impression, that, from the first, your lordship's amicable and liberal views in relation to this state, have not only been discordant with the natural disposition of the Peshwa, but totally adverse to that selfish and wicked policy, which, in a certain degree, he seems to have realized.&#x2014;In the midst of personal peril and the lowest debasement, he viewed the admission of permanent support from your Lordship with the deepest aversion.&#x2014;The dark complexion of the Peshwa's disposition and character, the disgustful history of his domestic and public conduct, his atrocious machinations, &c.;&#x2014;His faithless and sordid policy, his hatred and jealousy of the British name.&#x2014;The present Pesbwa has, ever since the year 1793, acted more like an enemy, than a friend of the company's government.\"&#x2014;\"Yet, after all, he appears to be a young man, of whom a chief of his own family says that he had retired from Poona, owing to the thoughtlessness of youth.\" &#x2014;Thus it is that a native prince is loaded with abuse by the government of India that he is called on to give up a great proportion of his dominions, and all this for the purpose of securing tranquil possession of his throne. It was not a little singular too, that the Peshwa is always represented as a Sovereign Prince, that he was the head of the Mahrattas, and that the other chiefs were only his servants. This representation was directly contrary to fact. The Peshwa was nothing more than the Prime Minister among the Mahratta Confederacy. He was onlyprimus inter pares, and had no right to conclude that treaty against which it was quite clear he entertained a. most powerful, and, in his situation, natural aversion.&#x2014;The hon. member directed the attention of the house to the manner in which Scindia was spoken of by the officers in the Indian Government. It is in terms such as these that a high spirited Prince was vilified and traduced, though it did not appear that he had ever entertained any Views hostile to our interests. \"The perfidy and violence of that unprincipled chieftain.\"&#x2014; \"The corrupt and profligate councils of that weak,231arrogant, and faithless chief.&#x2014; His violence, rapacity, and lawless ambition, have been the main causes of the present war with the confedera[...]Mahratta Chiefs.&#x2014;An inexperienced youth, who as yet could form no correct judgment of his own true interests.\"&#x2014;\"Indeed, Scindia appears to be an inexperienced youth, and is, I understand, not at all conversant in business.\" He left the house to make their own comments on such apparent inconsistency. But he desired to call the attention of gentlemen to the species of treaty offered for the acceptance of Scindia, thus so violently denounced as the great foe to the tranquillity of India. The proposal was transmitted to Scindia in 1802, from the seat of government at Bengal: \"1st. To subsidize a considerable British force to be stationed within his dominionsin perpetuity: to cede in perpetual sovereignty to the company an extent of territory, the wet produce of which shall be adequate to the charges of that force; to admit the arbitration of the British government in all disputes and differences between Scindia and his highness the Nizam, and eventually between Scindia and the other powers of Hindostan.\" \"To obtain for the company the cession of the part of the Duab which is in Scindia's possession, and also that the fortresses of Agra and Delhi should be ceded to the company.\"&#x2014;\"Whatever proposals you may offer to Scindia, under the foregoing instructions, should be stated to him in the light ofa concessionon the part of the British government, tending to the Security of his interests and the stability of his dominion; not as directed to objects in any degree necessary to the security of the British empire in India.\" \"Col. Collins in-strutted to state to Scindia the manifest advantages to the stability of his government, and to the prosperity of his affairs, which the proposed connection is calculated to secure.\"&#x2014;He was aware that the great argument against the Mahrattas was their harbouring French officers among them, with views evidently hostile to our superiority. It was even asserted that there was an army of 14,000 Frcnch troops, under Capt. Perron. Of the existence of such a body of troops there was not a Single tittle of evidence before the house. If there was so large a body under his command, it was quite clear they were not French troops. In-232deed, after the Minutest investigation, he found that there were not in the whole Mahratta army more than 12 French officers; it was, however, further urged, that the French officers would introduce European tactics among the Mahratta troops. This, so far from striking his mind as an evil, was a thing much to be desired, if war was to be Kept up with the Mahratta states. It was by abandoning their own irregular mode of fighting that they suffered so severely, and were so effectually repulsed. Had they persevered in the irregular warfare common to their country, they would have exhibited an appearance. far more formidable,and displayed a resistance tar more dreadful. The history of all ages proved the truth of this assertion. The Parthians often repulsed the disciplined legions of Rome, not indeed in regular combat, but by surrounding them, by cutting off their supplies of provisions, by taking all those advantages peculiar to a barbarous enemy. His view of the fighting of the Mahrattas had been well understood by military men. Mr. Hastings, one whose name he never could mention except when he had an opportunity of mentioning it with approbation, was fully of this opinion, and the same gentleman had expressed himself in very strong terms on the policy of limiting our dominions. As to any wish of Scindia to admit French troops into his dominions, he denied its existence. It was notorious that Scindia abhorred the idea of foreign troops in any part of his states. Perron was equally hateful and dreadful to him. It was a fact well known, that the knowledge of this hatred was one great inducement with Perron, to capitulate with the few troops under his command.&#x2014;In no view of the case, did he think, then, that the justice or necessity of the war had been established in a satisfactory manner. The reluctance shewn against the proud and insolent terms of our treaty was natural. It would have been astonishing if it had not existed. The hon. gent. desired members to put the matter to their Own feelings. Was it not natural for a high-spirited Chief to spurn at terms so abject? To be told that the capital of the Mahratta Empire was to be in the hands of a British garrison, and to be supported by the native princes, was surely the extremest degradation. It was unquestionably adding injury to insult. He begged leave to put a parallel case, and ask then,233what would be gentleman's ideas of the attempt, if Bonapart&#x00E9; were to propose to the independent Emperor of Austria to fill Vienna with a French garrison, and to have this garrison supported out of the Emperor's coffers? What would be thought of such a monstrous proposition? Would it not be treated with contempt and indignation? Would the king of Prussia, the elector of Saxony, or any other member of the Germanic Body, see it even hinted at with indifference? Should we not expect to see them in arms to resist it, if attempted by force, or should we not equally detest and despise their cowardice, if they allowed it to pass with impunity? Human nature was the same in all countries on some grand subjects of reasoning and feeling. If we should commend European Sovereigns resenting insolence and repelling oppression, should we not allow something to the feelings of a Mahratta Chief, indignant at seeing the capital of his empire in the hands of a foreign garrison?&#x2014;He called on gentlemen to think and feel, and then he thought there could be little doubt on the result of their inquiries. He was himself not satisfied that the war against Scindia was just or necessary. He found nothing in the papers on the table to support such an opinion. The hon. member touched on the mode in which our wars were conducted in India, allowing them even to be just or necessary. He strongly condemned putting British troops so much in the brunt of every engagement. If a town was to be scaled, if a pass was to be stormed, if any service of difficulty was to be performed, Europeans were always employed. This waste of men who were so invaluable, was altogether unaccountable. It should be recollected that Europeans were equally our protection against the hostility of the natives, the only security against the treachery of our Sepoys, whom the Mahratta chiefs might succeed in detaching from their allegiance. This last was a critical and interesting view of the subject, and was a most powerful inducement no longer to persist in extending our empire by useless and insecure conquests. If our army were scattered over an immense tract of country; if they were to stretch to Agra, to Delhi and to Poonah, it was impossible to say to what disasters they might be exposed. He said, with great emphasis, we first had commerce commerce produced factories, factories234produced garrisons, garrisons produced armies, armies produced conquests, and conquests had brought us into our present situation. He hoped all that reason could allow him from the noble lord lately appointed to the government of India. Whatever could be effected by prudence, justice and moderation, would distinguish his administration. The hon. gent. after complimenting the talents of lord Wellesley, concluded with the following motion: That this house adheres to the principle established by its unanimous resolution of the 28th of May, 1782, and recognised and adopted by the legislature in two several acts of parliament of the 24th and 33d year of his majesty's reign&#x2014;namely, \"that to pursue schemes of conquest and extension of dominion in India, are measures repugnant to the wish, the honour, and the policy of this nation.\" Upon the question being put from the chair.", "author_id": "/people/sir-philip-francis", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

It surprised him very much to hear the noble lord opposite him (Castlereagh) argue in the manner he had done; it surprised kiln much to hear him state that his hon. friend had no right to look bark to points which were more remote, and took place at a more distant period of time, merely because, as the noble lord stated, he had not come forward at every intermediate step, and moved for those papers, and that information, which might then have existed. He denied that this was any argument against his coming forward now, with this very necessary motion; but, even supposing it was, his hon. friend had complied with it in every respect, for, to his knowledge, no one instance had passed without his calling for papers, and doing every thing that could in any way be thought necessary. The hon. and learned gent. remarked, with some severity, on the term \"connection,\" as it had been applied to the mode which we pursued towards the Mahrattas, a nation containing 30,000,000 of people. The question, at the best, was on a point of very dubious policy. He praised the conduct of marquis Cornwallis when in India before, and trusted his return there would be attended with similar advantages. The noble lord seemed to misunderstand every thing advanced by his hon. friend, from beginning to end. What harm could result from re-asserting those principles which were already to be found in the resolutions of the house, and in the statutes? He condemned the modes practised by the company for the acquirement of territory in India. It was once given as Mr Hastings's opinion, that the possession of the whole of Bengal alone might242ruin the company. Formerly, there were a number of petty states between Bengal and the Mahrattas, which it was our policy to support. Now, we had swallowed up, one after another, all those Mohammedan powers. If the noble lord had chosen to go into the justice of the wars in which we had so frequently engaged in that country, he had no objection. The causes of, many of them were of a very doubtful complexion. The nabob of Arcot was punished for the offences of his grandmother; Cossim Ali Cawir for cultivating his country too well; and others were set aside on different pretences: the Nizam we had, however, left, under what was called our protection. We made him our ally to get more territory from kiln, to maintain an army which we sent him, and which army was, in fact, to hold his country. He should not have said so much on this point, had not the noble lord spoken of the justice of our India wars in such a tone of triumph. He saw nothing to stop this principle of aggrandisement; he saw no bounds but the wall of China, or the Russian empire, to our daily acquisitions of territory while this system continued. We were on the Mahratta borders. If they are disturbed, we are distressed. If they settled their quarrels, we were afraid they would have too much power. What was the true meaning of that word connection which the noble lord used? It was not connection, but dependence on our military power in India. The natural consequence would be, speedily to take the whole country. After the conquest of the Mysore, the Peishwa refused to sign the treaty of alliance we had proposed to him; but we took advantage of his misfortunes and flight, to force him to sign it, and he had not, after all, ever requested us to act upon it. We had adopted a kind of geographical morality, and a sort of policy of latitude and longitude for our own purposes in India, different from what we conceived of those things in Europe. Gentlemen could hear of the most terrible calamities in India without emotion, who, for a little finger ache at home, would dissolve in sentimental sorrow.

If Scindeah and Holkar had not been divided at Poonah, the consequence would have been the consolidation of their several great powers, and we should have had them both joined against us. The Mah-247rattas had always had it in contemplation, ever since the death of Sujat. UI Dowla, to extirpate the English from India. Madajee Scindeah had the same, and he thought the marquis Wellesley had the highest degree of merit, in being able to frustrate their machinations, and by attacking them separately, preventing those mischievous consequences which a combination of their powers could not fail to produce. From the character of the noble marquis, if he could have preserved peace consistently with the interests of the company, he was certain he would have done it. It had been the favourite design of the Mahrattas, for upwards of twenty years, to extirpate-the English from India, and for this express purpose they had been at a very great expence in improving their tactics and engaging in their service as many Europeans as possible.

He trusted, that it was with that view, and with these intentions, that marquis Cornwallis would set out for that country. In sending out that noble marquis in lieu of lord Wellesley, we were substituting the olive branch for the sword, and this at a time that such a substitution was essentially necessary. Such a declaration as that now moved for would shew that parliament are determined on a dereliction of the late system; and it would show the marquis and the native powers in India, that you do not send him out merely as a common governor-general, but that the country might derive advantage from that conciliatory disposition which is so much wanted to heal the wounds which, he thought, had too rashly been inflicted there. If we were to hold India, and to keep the French out of it, we must not think of doing either by the sword, but by conciliating the minds of the native powers, and convincing them that justice and moderation should be the future rule of our conduct towards them. No one could deny that marquis Wellesley had acted with great energy and activity. In his opinion the noble marquis was too active, too energetic and too enterprising. The noble lord had pursued the warlike system too far, and had thus created a discontent and disposition to resistance among the native powers, of which the French, or any power hostile to us, could easily avail itself, if it could obtain any footing in India.

But the right hon. gent. on the other side, seemed to say, that our -situation was materially altered since 1782, with respect to India. Where, he would ask, was the material circumstance of change? We were at war with France251in 1782&#x2014;The French were as willing to excite an opposition to us in India, and Tippoo was quite as willing to second such Views as the Mahrattas can be supposed at present. Yet under all these circumstances we concluded the resolution of 1782. He called upon the house to come to some discussion upon this point. If the extension of territory were desirable, let the motion be negatived at once, and let some course be determined on. But let not such a line of policy be followed as was calculated to keep alive doubt and suspicion, and forbid the possibility of confidence in our views among the native powers. Every pretence seemed to be sought for to declare war in India, and it appeared impossible to calculate when this propensity to war would cease. As soon as we had destroyed Tippoo, it was then stated to be very desirable to forma close connection with those Mahratta powers, which were previously pronounced our friends. This connexion we had soon formed with them, and we gave them something like what the French used to term the \"fraternal hug.\" We embraced the Mahrattas, just as the French embraced Holland. We, in fact, seemed in India, to be like Macbeth, \"so steeped in blood\" that we thought it vain to go back. Sed revocare gradum, hic labor, hoc opus est. After destroying Tippoo, who formed a barrier between us and our friends the Mahrattas, we then proceeded to destroy our friends themselves. But, it is said, that you waged war against the Mahrattas, merely from a fear of the French; and a similar plea may be alleged with equal justice, against any state in India, until, in the work of destruction, the English force may make its way to the wall of China, or farther if they could. War was declared against the Mahrattas, because they were the only power remaining in India. So that in other words, our govt. appeared to argue, that we could not be safe until all India was our own. His opinion, the hon. member declared to be decidedly different. The best way in his view to secure our interest and possessions, was to prohibit their extension. As to the allusion made to the character of lord Wellesley, he could not admit that the motion was meant to reflect on that noble lord, upon whose conduct he was not now prepared to pronounce any opinion. If the administration of that noble lord was meant to be inquired into, when he should return home would cer-252tainly be the proper time to institute such inquiry. An hon. gent. (Mr. Princep) was of opinion that the adoption of this motion would operate to fetter lord Cornwallis. But he believed, on the contrary, that it would serve to fortify the views and intentions of that noble lord. It would shew him that the policy he held was sanctioned by the voice of parliament. He remembered it having been said with respect to his India bill, that the objection was not so much to the measure as to the man; but on this occasion he should say, with .respect to the motion and lord Cornwallis, that this measure was the man. The hon. gent. on the other side entertained opinions directly the reverse of those professed by the three respectable directors of the India company, whom the house had heard declare an unqualified adherence to the resolution of 1782. The right hon. gent. had advanced some statements which shewed that he contemplated schemes of ambition far more wild and mad than the governor of India was ever suspected of. For the right hon. gent.'s ideas would go to this, that we should possess ourselves of all India; and if possessed of that vast empire, he contended that it would be an intolerable drain upon our military resource to preserve it, while its preservation would not be so conducive to our benefit, as India governed upon the principle laid down in the motion would be. But the main pretence rested upon by the advocates for further conquests seems to be this, that they are necessary for our safety. Now this was precisely the pretence of all conquerors and marauders, in all ages. According to Livy, whenever the Romans made war upon any state, it was only to secure their own safety. Such was the plea advanced and exactly the same was the ground frequently urged by Lewis XIV. and others entertaining similar views. In the name of common sense and justice, he would ask, where such a plea was likely to stop? Where was this resort for safety to end, for, according as it was applied, no man was likely to be at peace, for he could not calculate upon safety while there was another man alive who had strength enough to knock him down. Thus no state could be at peace, until every nation capable of attacking it was destroyed. Such was the tendency of the argument deducible from the abominable principle laid down to excuse our wars in India, respecting the weans of securing253our safety. The operation of such a plea struck him to have no end but in unbounded dominion. The hon. gent. concluded with expressing a hope that whether the motion before the house should be acceded to or not, something declaratory of the proposed system with respect to India, would be adopted as a guide to our governors in India, as a rule by which our views might be judged of by the natives. If that system should be consonant with moderation and justice, it would be founded on the principle of this motion, and best calculated, he was confident, to promote our interests in India.", "author_id": "/people/mr-charles-fox-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

{"date": ["1805", "apr", "08"], "content": "rose to make his promised motion, founded on the tenth report of the Commissioners of Naval Enquiry, and spoke as follows:&#x2014;When first, sir, I gave notice that, I should call the attention of the house to the subject on which I am now to address you, it was my intention to follow, the precedents by which the house have been generally guided, and to move that the tenth report of the commissioners of Naval Enquiry be taken into consideration in a committee. I have, however, since, on mature reflection, seen reason to alter this original resolution, and confining myself to the most important part of that report, to make that the foundation of certain propositions with which I shall have the honour to conclude. With due respect to all the commissioners which have ever sat under the authority and appointment of this house, I must be permitted to say, that none was ever more honourable in its origin, none had ever prosecuted its inquiries with more real advantage to the public interest. It is well known that this commission originated from the late Board of Admiralty, at the head of which presided that noble lord256who had so often signalized his prowess in fighting the battles of his country. That noble lord, however, not satisfied with combating and subduing her enemies abroad, returned home to overturn her domestic foes, by exploding those mines of corruption which rendered all advantages of victory fruitless and unavailing. The commissioners thus constituted have already made a variety of reports, though I am sorry to say that on few have any proceedings hitherto be en founded. I certainly do take some degree of merit to myself for having moved for certain papers calculated to elucidate the first report, and was then given to understand that a commission had been appointed to carry into effect such suggestions in the report as appeared likely to be adopted with advantage. What progress has been made by this commission does not hitherto appear, though at a future time I may feel it my duty to bring the matter again under the consideration of the house. But to return to the Commissioners of Naval Inquiry, I think it clearly demonstrated, that if they had greater difficulties to encounter than any former commission suffered; if they have been attacked in a manner contrary to all decency by the whole host of jobbers and depredators, whose villainies it was their object to expose; if they have been described as exercising the office of inquisitors rather than of commissioners; if their views have been vilified not only in this house but throughout the public at large; if every possible obstacle has been thrown in the way of their investigations; if every thing, in short, has been done to disgust them, and make them relinquish the great task entrusted to them by this house; and if, overlooking all these considerations, they have thought only of discharging their duty to their country, it will not surely be denied that their merit has, been greatly enhanced, that they are entitled to the warmest gratitude of the best interests of this empire. By their firmness and their perseverance they have discovered what eluded the most diligent inquiries of various commissions appointed for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of various abuses in the public expenditure, what all the vigilance of committees of this house could not fully bring to light. The commissioners having thus done their duty to the public, it falls to my lot to bring to justice the criminals whom they have exposed. It is needless for me to insist on257the importance of the subject on which I am now addressing you. It is important to the high person whom the propositions with which I shall conclude principally involve. It is important to the very salvation and existence of our country. It is important to the commissioners who have brought forward this most interesting report. If the house decide, as it appears to me that they are in duty bound, and as it strikes me it is almost impossible for them not to decide, it will prove that no person guilty of so flagrant a violation of an express act of parliament, as that contained in the tenth report, that no individual strongly suspected of conniving at such unwarrantable application of the public money, or receiving any advantage from this misapplication, however high Ins rank or extensive his influence, shall escape with impunity. The public will look with reverence to ours decisions; they will be convinced that a door is opened for the introduction of regularity and economy in our public expenditure, and that if our burthens are extreme, their produce will at least be applied to the purposes for which parliament intended them. If, on the contrary, our decision should be contrary to these just hopes and expectations; if we shall, in defiance of the report on our table, pronounce the noble lord not guilty, then indeed tile people will have serious cause for complaint and indignation; then the vulgar assertion may with great apparent plausibility be employed; we may with truth be accused of seeking only emolument as our sole object, in place of the good of our country. No longer can we he considered as statesmen animated by a laudable spirit of ambition&#x2014;that ambition implanted in our nature to incite us to high deeds. We must then be considered as acting only from the base, sordid motives which degrade the character of the statesman, and render him contemptible in the eves of his fellow citizens. Feeling these truths severely, I do trust that the house will accede to those propositions which it is my intention to found on the facts which the tenth report has disclosed. This report involves a considerable number of individuals. It is not only Lord Melville and Mr. Trotter, his pay-master, that are involved, but we have Mr. Wilson and Mr. Mark Sprott, who cut on inconsiderable figure in the scene. We have also brought before us the high and258respectable company of the bank of England. If I am not also misinformed, the report to a certain degree involves the character of the right hon. gentleman (Mr. Pitt) on the other side of the house. With respect to what is said in the report about the Bank of England, I am not satisfied that the conduct of the governors in allowing the money, the public money, to be withdrawn in the way in which it has been, was correct. On the contrary, it has every appearance of being in direct opposition to the express regulations of an act of parliament. The evidence of the, officer of the Bank, who was examined before the commissioners, does not fully do away this impression. With respect to what I alluded to respecting the right hon. gentleman opposite, I shall explain my meaning in a few words. I have been informed that the right hon. gentleman, several years ago, when he last held the same situation which he now enjoys, was informed of the existence of the practice of withdrawing the public money contrary to an express act of parliament, and that no steps whatever were taken to put an end to it. If this statement be correct, the right hon. gent. will permit me to say, that his conduct betrayed very culpable negligence, and a very unjustifiable connivance at a practice which every man who values the proper regulation of the public expenditure must consider as highly dangerous. In bringing forward a charge against lord Melville, I do not bring a charge against a mere unprotected individual. During the greater part of his life he has enjoyed an ample share of the public rewards, and public honours. For a period of thirty years he has been in the uninterrupted possession of some lucrative office, and he has at the same time exercised a most extensive influence. He has, no doubt, many friends attached to him by the consciousness of obligation, and though he is not now present to hear the charge preferred against him, he has many friends in this house who will be happy in the opportunity of undertaking his defence. Thinking, then, that I take no unfair advantage of him, I proceed to that charge which his friends will be fully able to explain to him in another place. In conducting this business, it will be my object strictly to adhere to that moderation which is the most adapted for the investigation of truth, but, at the same time, with that firmness and perseverance which my duty259to the public imposes on me. In the case which I have to lay before the house, there are some circumstances of aggravation which will render it necessary for me to occupy a greater portion of your time, than I could otherwise have wished, and to employ terms of greater severity, which, on other occasions, would readily be spared. When I look to the individual who is the principal criminal, against whom my charge will be directed, I see many reasons which increase the magnitude of his offence. .At the close of the American war, when we were plunged into the greatest national distress, and when the public began to see that there had been a gross misapplication of our resources, petitions flowed in from all parts of the country, praying for some reform in the expenditure of the public treasure. The right hon. gent. opposite was then in the dawn of his political life, and in nothing did he seem more desirous of recommending himself to notice and distinction, than by his zeal for the reform of abuses, and his anxiety to have a well-regulated system of economy established it, every part of the public expenditure. Committees were accordingly appointed, and on the reports which they produced, regulations were framed for diminishing every sort of unnecessary expenditure, and for removing all those causes which had formerly created these excesses. Of these the most prominent was the regulation for lessening the balances in the hands of public officers. It was at the same time resolved that a number of the fees and gratuities formerly existing in public offices should be withdrawn, and instead of them permanent and adequate salaries should be allowed. It was particularly laid down, as a most important regulation, that the paymaster of the forces and the treasurer of the navy should have a specific salary, and that they should neither directly or indirectly derive any advantage from the use of the public money. Now, these resolutions are alive in the recollection and feelings of many gentlemen who are at present members of this house; and sure I am, that lord Melville is the very last man in the world who can at all plead ignorance of their existence, He, indeed, distinguished himself at that period for his professed zeal, for the reform of abuses, with what sincerity I leave to the judgment of the house to decide. He surely could not have possibly misunderstood the intention of the legislature, and I am not now to inform him for the first time, that260the abuses in the offices of the paymaster of the forces and the treasurer of the navy were the leading features in all the reports of the parliamentary committees of that day. In 1781, a positive resolution passed on the reports of one of those committees, declaring it as their opinion, that neither the paymaster nor the treasurer of the navy should draw any part of the public money till it was positively wanted for the public service. The report further goes on to state the opinion of the committee, that the treasurer of the navy should henceforth act as an accountant, and not as a banker, to the nation. A report was at the same time made of the amount of the treasurer of the navy's salary, which was 2000l. exclusive of profit arising from the use of balances of the public money in his hands. It was on these reports resolved that all these balances should be forthwith paid into the bank of England, and that the salary of the treasurer should be fixed at 4000l. in lieu of all fees, emoluments, or gratuities of whatever description. What was the conduct of Mr. Barr&#x00E9;, at that time treasurer of the navy? Even before the resolution had been submitted to the legislature, he spontaneously paid into the Bank of England the whole amount of the balances at that period in his possession. In this case the house will see clearly that Mr. Barr&#x00E9; was not placed in circumstances at all parallel to those under which lord Melville has acted. There hitherto existed no positive law to force Mr. Barr&#x00E9; to surrender up his balances, but he very wisely bowed to the decision of a committee of the house, and shewed his readiness even to anticipate the future resolution of the legislature. Mr. Barr&#x00E9; thus gave the promptest proof of his obedience to the voice of parliament, and it was proved before the commissioners by the only person now surviving to attest the fact, that Mr. Barr&#x00E9;, never afterwards, directly or indirectly, received the least emolument from the public money beyond the established salary; and the same observation applies to every one of those in his employment [A cry of hear! hear!]. Lord Melville succeeded Mr. Barr&#x00E9; for a few months, as treasurer of the navy; and whether, during this short period, be received any advantage from the public money, whether it was placed in the Bank of England, locked up in the iron chest, or lodged in the hands of a private banker, I have not at this day the opportunity of deciding.261This is at least certain, that Lord Bayning, who succeeded Lord Melville, had no sort of difficulty in answering the commissioners. His answer was manly and honourable. On being asked, whether he enjoyed any separate emolument or advantage from the public money, he unequivocally answers in the negative. After the dissolution of the ministry of that day, we again have Lord Melville treasurer of the navy. On his resuming his old station he discovered that the salary did not exactly amount to the sum which parliament proposed. An act of council accordingly passed on this representation, and the net salary of 4000l. a year was established. This sum so established, was expressly declared to be in lieu of all emoluments, fees or advantages. In 1785, in consequence of a recommendation of his majesty in his speech from the throne, an act was passed, containing those regulations on which the future conduct of the civil department of the navy was to be orgarnised. At that tune the right hon. gentleman .opposite held out to the house the most brilliant picture of the beneficial effects of these plans of improvement. While he spoke of the means by which economy was to be promoted, he did not forget the noble lord against whom my charge is now to be preferred, but selected him as the person most fit to carry them into the fullest activity. He must now have seen his mistake, or, at least, the public were long since convinced both of the fallacy of the hopes by which they were flattered, and the peculiar unfitness of the noble lord to undertake any thing like national reform in any one of its departments. From the conduct which the noble lord has since pursued, one would think that he had been employed in the work of reform only to bring it into contempt; that he was put forth as an instrument of correcting abuses only to render them more inveterate. The bill of 1785 did pass, and the noble lord was the person selected to carry it for the approbation of the other branch of the legislature. Never was the spirit as well as the letter of any act less favourable to willful misrepresentation; never could any thing afford a more ,wretched handle for any thing like subterfuge and equivocation. I cannot suffer myself to believe that the friends of the noble lord will attempt to screen his conduct, under pretence that the letter of the law has not been violated. Such an apology would only serve to heighten his criminality; and, for the no-262ble lord's own sake, I trust it will not be resorted to. But, sir, let me only call your attention to the preamble of the bill, and the house will see that neither its letter nor spirit can be misunderstood for a single moment. The preamble of the bill recites all the abuses specified in the several reports, alludes to the resolutions for the correction of those abuses, and specifies that a specific salary is to be given in lieu of all fees, emoluments, or advantages. A competent salary was established, that all temptation to make an improper use of the public money might be avoided. Thus then, both according to the spirit and letter of the act, it was impossible for the noble lord, or any other human being, to mistake what was the direct object of the legislature. Now, what was the first act of the first part, in the second treasurership of Lord Melville, with this act expressly in his view? The act says, that all money shall be immediately taken from the hands of the treasurer, and lodged in the Bank Of England. The act passed in July, 1785, and it was not till the subsequent January that the balances were paid into the Bank, agreeably to the terms of the act. What possible excuse can be set up for such an extraordinary violation of an act of parliament, in the framing of which the noble lord himself, in all probability, took a. material interest? He is the first to violate that law to which so much importance is attached. In what manner too does this violation take place? It appears, that on the 31st January, 1784, the-balance in the hands of the treasurer of the navy was upwards of 70,000l.; and in July, 1785, it had increased to upwards of 113,000l. being an augmentation of more than 42,000l. betwixt the two periods to which I have alluded. I wish to know then why this delay, in the transfer of the balance took place? It is impossible to account for this by any consistent principle. The only way of accounting for the matter satisfactorily, is to suppose that it was withheld with the sole view of private emolument I know it has been contended that the delay took place in consequence of some regulations in the treasurer's office being incomplete, but will such a pretext as this impose even on the weakest understanding? What difficulty was there in the transfer which the act required? What new regulations were wanting to complete the sate lodgment of the balances of the treasurer of the navy in the263Bank of England? But it is to such wretched pretexts .as this that the noble lord is reduced when unable to give any other reason for the violation of an act of parliament than that which I have just referred to. Such is the situation in which we find the noble lord at the expiration of the first part of his second treasurership. I shall now go on to the consideration of the sequel of this second treasurership, which forms the grand subject of the tenth report. In doing this I shall arrange my observations under three distinct charges. In the first place, then, I charge Lord Melville with having applied the money of the public to other uses than those of the naval department with which he was connected, in express contempt of an act of parliament, and in gross violation of his duty. I charge the noble lord, in the second place, with conniving at a system of peculation in an individual, for whose conduct in the use of the public money he was deeply responsible, and for this connivance I denounce him as guilty of a high crime and misdemeanour. To these two charges I shall, on the present occasion, chiefly confine myself; but there is still a third, on which I shall not insist very largely now, but which, if the inquiry is instituted, I shall feel myself most powerfully called on to support in this house. I mean here to allude to the strong suspicion that the noble lord himself was a participator in that system of peculation to which I have referred, and is consequently liable to very severe pains and penalties. Unless what has been said could be unsaid, unless what has appeared before the commissioners could be obliterated, it appears to me almost impossible to get rid of this impression. I have said that I will pursue this inquiry with moderation on my own part, but I repeat, that I will follow it up with steadiness and firmness for the country. It is certainly to the honour of our public men, that even in times when party spirit was at its height, when the political world was the most violently agitated and convulsed, charges such as that which I now bring forward against the noble lord have seldom been preferred. It is a singular circumstance, however, that the only instance of a similar charge for a great number of years was brought against a great public criminal by the same noble lord whose accuser I now appear, I allude to the case of Sir T. Rumbold for malversations in India; but it is not my wish to carry matters to264such an extremity against the noble lord, though my duty impels me to bring him, before the proper tribunal. In making out my charge against the noble lord I must call your attention to what is stated in the report, for it is material to see what is the nature of the evidence produced. First of all, then, the commissioners found that there had been for a number of years deficiencies in the treasurer's department, to the amount of upwards of 674,000l. a year. I am not now wishing to rest much on the correctness of the particular sum. Whether it be ten pence, ten pounds, or even a million, the principle is the same, whatever be the magnitude of the deficiency. That a deficiency did exist is not denied, for even lord Melville himself owns its existence. In this situation the commissioners evinced a very laudable desire to ascertain how the deficiencies had originated; and for this purpose it was necessary that lord Melville and Mr. Trotter should be summoned before them. As in this state of the business I shall have frequent occasion to allude to Trotter, it may be proper, to say a few words in explanation. When I speak of Trotter, I speak at the same time of lord Melville, for in the whole of this business they are completely identified. The action of the one I view as the action of the other. This, indeed, is the exact view taken by the committees which, reported on the situation of the treasurer and paymaster of the navy. They considered the office of treasurer as a mere sinecure, the whole of his, business being done by a deputy, and in this relation precisely does Mr. Trotter stand to lord Melville. The one transacts the, business, and the other incurs all the responsibility. The treasurer of the navy, as in lord Melville's case, was often a privy and even a cabinet counsellor, and it is very fit that he should be relieved from the cares of office. But if he is to enjoy, emolument without labour, it surely is not, asking. too much to have a little responsibility attached to the distribution of the public money. So much then as to the, identity of Mr. Trotter and lord Melville in this business. So zealous did lord Melville appear for the proper administration of the civil department of the navy, that, not satisfied with the bill of 1785, he actually proposed and obtained an act of council for authorizing, in the management of the pecuniary concerns of the navy, a variety of fresh regulations. [Here the hon. member read a few passages from the, act.]&#x2014;Thus, continued he,265were all the regulations that the noble lord proposed for the economical govt. of the navy conceded to him, and he had nothing left to impede his favourite plans of improvement; and he is the man to authorize his own paymaster to hold in contempt the peremptory orders of the legislature! He heaps up regulations and takes not the least care that they shall be in one shape or other observed. On the contrary, these deficiencies are evidence how grossly the intentions of the legislature have been evaded.&#x2014;Before I consider what Mr. Trotter's answer was, let me remark, that the general complexion of the evidence before the commissioners was of a very extraordinary description. I had almost said, all the witnesses gave a reluctant and disgraceful testimony. I was rather unguarded in my expression, for I own that several respectable gentlemen gave their testimony with a candour that did honour to their character and feelings. The others gave a testimony extorted from them, or sheltered their guilt under mysterious silence.&#x2014;Much as I approve of and admire the proceedings of the commissioners, I do wish that they had forced some of these gentlemen to favour us with a little more of their reluctant information. I think they might have done this in perfect consistency with the powers with which they were invested. What is stated in this reluctant testimony has, however, this advantage, that it possesses the strongest character of credibility. It has been strangely asserted by some persons that the report of the commissioners is altogetherex parte, and ought not to be the foundation of any decision. I really am at a loss to conceive: how any man can make such a strange assertion. I ask, had not lord Melville and Mr. Trotter a fair opportunity of vindicating their character before the commissioners, if they were conscious of innocence? When lord Melville was asked a plain question as to his appropriation of any part of the public money, what had he to do? Why, he had only to declare on his oath and his honour&#x2014;No. What had Mr. Trotter to do? He had only to give the same answer of&#x2014;No. But how do they think fit to proceed? Instead of following the plain path of integrity and honour, they profess total ignorance of deficiencies in the public money to a vast amount. The paymaster is called before the commissioners, and he professes to know nothing at all of the matter. By and by he, however, turns the matter266a little seriously in his mind, and he does begin to recollect that he does know something of the business. He confesses that he had been, from 1786 down to the period when he was examined, in the habit of drawing out the public money, and placing it in the hands of his own banker. The commissioners inquire a little further into the matter, but he will give them no satisfaction. \"You have no right to ask me these questions, that is my private money.\" Nay, he even arraigns the commissioners, and in a paper which, from mere indulgence, they allowed him to present, he pretty clearly insinuates that they were a parcel of gentlemen making themselves a great deal too free with other people's secrets. Five different times is Mr. Alexander Trotter examined, and he refuses to give the commissioners the information they require. He talks, indeed, of sums advanced for other departments of the government, and alludes to Mr. Long having repaid to him some of the sums so advanced. I am sorry that Mr. Long was not examined before the commissioners. I think his statements might have thrown a good deal of light on this subject. Though, however, Mr. Long was not examined before the commissioners, the fact of the advances is admitted by lord Melville in his first letter to the commissioners. Indeed this letter was altogether of an extraordinary complexion. It was, however, of a piece with his lordship's evidence, and with his last letter, on both of which I shall, before I sit down, make a few observations. His lordship tells the commissioners that he cannot give them the information they required, because he cannot disclose confidential communications of government; but his great argument is, that he is not in possession of the papers containing the advances to other departments, having, for mere amusement no doubt, committed them to the flames. I do maintain, that this avowal of the noble lord is highly culpable. The destruction of these papers was, in a person of his knowledge of business, a great crime and misdemeanor. He ought to have known that papers of such a description are the property of no individual; they are the property of the nation. I recollect several committees complaining of the destruction of papers, and stating that, in consequence of such destruction, their inquiries were either retarded or altogether destroyed. To destroy public papers, referring to a recent date, does, in my267mind, imply something suspicious. I cannot easily trace it to any other principle than a wish to prevent criminal proceedings from being unravelled, and accompanied with merited punishment. But it seems that the noble lord has not only destroyed his papers, he has also actually lost his recollection of the whole affair, though it had so recently occurred. This does, I confess, seem a little strange, that a person of his lordship's great talents should labour under such a wonderful decay of memory. Of this, however, I shall say something more before I finish my observations. On the subject of these advances to the other departments, I condemn the practice in the strongest terms. I would in no case permit it to exist, but I could never for a moment suffer it to exist without explanation, and that too of the most satisfactory nature. Here, however, I hear the noble lord allowing that such advances were made, but he will give me no satisfaction as to the extent of the advances or the manner in which they were applied. In spite of the noble lord's silence, we know that the navy service was not in a situation to allow great advances of money, and what an apology would it offer if a demand on the navy board could not be paid, because, forsooth, lord Melville, and Alexander Trotter his paymaster, had agreed to accommodate the other branches of the service with loans of the public money? It may be said that the advances were to the secretary of state for important purposes. I shall not easily be brought to sanction these accommodations betwixt different servants of the crown. But lord Melville was minister at war, president of the board of control, and treasurer of the navy, all united in his own person, and here is a transaction, not betwixt two individuals, but one individual, uniting three different characters. It is Mr. Dundas lending Mr. Dundas with the one hand, and borrowing of Mr. Dundas with the other. It was a ridiculous, as well as dangerous combination. I know that some gentlemen on the other side will find all this system of accommodation very excusable. The public service is expedited, .and no loss is sustained. I confess I cannot assent to such doctrines. I know that they were often urged by the right hon. gent. opposite, last war, and I have not forgotten all the fine things he told the house about the appropriation paper, and the manner in which each sum was satisfactorily accounted for to the public. I268was never satisfied with such a loose way of dealing with the public money, and I always thought that the solid reasoning of my hon. friend near me (Mr. Fox) shewed completely how hollow and dangerous they were in practice. But even allowing the right hon. gent.'s arguments all their weight, they did not at all go to prove that such advances were either legal or expedient. Legal no man dares to call them, and certainly there is a great difference betwixt the treasurer of the navy and the finance minister of the country.&#x2014; My second charge against lord Melville is, that he connived at the appropriation of the public money to private purposes. Mr. Trotter does not deny that he had large sums in the hands of Mr. Coutts, his private banker; and he has the effrontery to tell the commissioners, that it is more convenient for him to have his cash in the hands of a private banker than in the Bank of England, where an express act of parliament has declared that it shall be placed. This very ingenious gentleman thinks proper to add, that he finds himself more secure when his money is in the hands of Mr. Coutts than when it is in the Bank of England. Not only does he affirm, but he calls his patron, Lord Melville, to confirm his testimony;&#x2014;Lord Melville, who had promoted the passing of the act of 1785, which expressly says the money shall be lodged in the bank;&#x2014;Lord Melville, who, not satisfied with the act of 1785, gets new regulations, still more stict, in 1786. He likewise tells the commissioners, that Mr. Trotter's mode is also most convenient for the public service. Sir, I am really astonished to hear of the inconveniencies of having the money at the bank instead of a private banker's! Is not the discount at the bank easier than at a private banker's establishment? Cannot bank notes be more easily procured? But if the present mode, of which Mr. Trotter appears so fond, be so very advantageous, how comes it that Lord Melville never came to parliament to get it formally recognized? Mr. Trotter, indeed, finds a very ingenious reason for placing his money in the hands of a private banker. He says, that he was so anxious for the security of the money that he placed it in Mr. Coutts's, as the best place of safety. If any thing comes of the money I am an undone man, and my mind will never be at ease till Mr. Coutts has taken it into his protection. Now, it was not, though very improbable, altogether impossible that269a house, respectable as Mr. Coutts's was, might fail, and what then becomes of the careful Mr. Trotter's security?. Why, sir, it is completely crushed and annihilated. But if he was so very careful as he pretends to be, why did he not place it in the Bank, where, even if a failure were to take place, still Mr. Trotter would be secure in his obedience to an act of parliament? I wish to ask the house for what purposes these perpetual draughts of money, this constant fluctuation of accounts in the name of Mr. Trotter, took place? At the time that Mr. Trotter is so anxious for the security of his money, was it lodged at Mr. Coutts's, allowing that to be a place of safety? No, it was employed in discounting bills, in forming speculations, in gambling on the stock exchange. I am really almost appalled, and I think that the house will likewise be appalled, at the reflection of no less than 134 millions of the pubic property having passed through Lord Melville's paymaster's hands. Why, sir, the report states explicitly that upwards of 8,000,000l. had been in the hands of the private banker, and nearly 7,000,000l. more. is alluded to as having passed through the same channel. But, what we have hitherto had disclosed is, perhaps, not one fourth of the money transactions of Lord Melville's paymaster, and much of the money in his hands when he was absolutely destitute of funds to make good the loss of one thousandth part of the public property in his hands. But while all these transactions were going forward, on what was Lord Melville employed? Does he know any thing at all of the state of Mr. Trotter's accounts, for every one of whose actions he alone is responsible? Has he carefully examined the use which Mr. Trotter has made of the public money, and is, he satisfied with the result? The truth is, if you are to believe Lord Melville himself, he knows nothing of the matter. What, then, is the state of Mr. Trotter's accounts? He himself pleads ignorance, and cannot satisfy the commissioners. What was the cause of all this affected ignorance may hereafter appear.&#x2014;One would have thought that a person of Mr. Trotter's perplexed turn of mind would have been anxious to do business in as simple a manner as possible, and in order to separate the public from his own private money, nothing would have been more easy than the simple device of having a public and a private account. This,270however, did not exactly suit Mr. Trotter's purpose. He preferred having a chest in which he was to receive money promiscuously. One man comes with live guineas, another with ten guineas, and a third with twenty, and so with different sums, and they are all thrown promiscuously into the chest. They return in a short time for their money, and Mr. Trotter, very complaisantly, says, \"Tis true, gentlemen, I did receive your money, but I threw it promiscuously into the chest, and it is altogether impossible for me to separate the different sums.\" Exactly similar to this is the conduct of Mr. Trotter in transacting his money concerns. He opens no less than five accounts. We have his own account&#x2014;his separate account&#x2014;his account as paymaster of the navy&#x2014;his broker's account&#x2014;and Jelicoe's account. He opens all these accounts, and when the commissioners ask him for what they were intended, he has the assurance to tell them that they had no right to interfere with his private affairs, and very flatly disclaims their powers.&#x2014;He draws under these heads immense sums of the public money&#x2014;as for example, a million of money in one day. On all the accounts there might be expected to be a number of curious and interesting items. The commissioners demand explanation, and again Mr. Alexander Trotter refuses to answer, and tells them to draw their own inference. The commissioners, baffled in getting information from Trotter, take up the business themselves, and here a curious scene is disclosed. Mr. Trotter, it is found, is busily engaged in buying all sorts of stock, and particularly active in purchasing navy bills, when they were at a price which rendered it almost certain that they might be afterwards disposed of to advantage. But while Mr. Trotter is so busy, what has become of lord Melville and his responsibility? Does he ever interfere to prevent these speculations? Does it never occur to him that it is extremely indecent for a paymaster of the navy thus to be sporting with the public money? I do think that it was the sacred duty of lord Melville to have told Mr. Trotter that he must either give up these connexions, or cease to be paymaster of the navy. If it had happened that in some of his extensive speculations he had been disappointed, inevitable ruin must have been the consequence. Had Mr. Trotter fell, it was not to him but to lord Melville271that the public were to look for redress. Lord Melville was involved in the fall of his paymaster, and all the consolation the public had, was to know that they were again to make good what the, servants of the public had peculated. I. cannot allow myself then to think that the house will be backward in agreeing with me that the negligent criminality of lord Melville was deserving of the severest reprehension. Let me, sir, recal to your attention what was the period when these speculations were going forward. It was in the very midst of our distresses; it was while the people were struggling up against that load of public burdens under which we groaned, that Mr. Trotter, with the assistance of that silent and discreet stock-broker Mark Sprott, were laying their heads together to lay out the public money to the greatest advantage. What was the whole amount of the sums so employed we have not the means of ascertaining. But this is of no consequence; for, as I have already observed, it is not the extent of the sum misapplied, but the general principle of misapplication that I contend for. I assert that Mark Sprott ought to have been more severely interrogated. There is no doubt that he is the man to give the clue to this nefarious business. Even his silence, however, was extremely expressive. It is not easy to conceive any thing more strange than the reasons, he urged for his silence. He tells the commissioners openly, \"I have had the opinion of Mr. serjeant Shepherd and other eminent lawyers, and they advise me to preserve a religious silence.\" Only be silent, say nothing, and we may be able to do something for you; but if you give answers, we much fear it is all over with you. Lord Melville and Mr. Mark Sprott are not quite uniform on this part of the business. Mr. Mark Sprott says nothing, but Lord Melville owns he knew of the transaction, but not of the detail. Sir, I say, if he knew of the transactions generally, and not of the detail, this, so far from rendering him less criminal, renders him still more guilty. If be was apprised that his paymaster was speculating in the funds, and if he derived no part of the profit, he was bound to see what was the extent of such speculations. He ought to have felt that his responsibility was in danger, and that it was full time for him to put a stop to so serious all evil.&#x2014;After illustrating this idea by reference to Mr. Trotter's salary as in-272adequate to any extensive speculations, the hon. gent. proceeded to animadvert on the origin of Mr. Trotter's connexion with lord Melville. Lord Melville had found Mr. Trotter clerk of the navy office. He made him his paymaster, and in a short time lord Melville contrives to make him his agent. In this situation of an agent, lord Melville has pecuniary concerns with Trotter to a vast amount, and when his lordship is examined he is unable to inform the commissioners whether the advances made by Mr. Trotter were from his own or from the public money. The honourable member animadverted strongly on this declaration, which was on the part of lord Melville extremely suspicious. How was it possible that lord Melville could for a moment suppose Mr. Trotter to be making advances out of his own fortune? The fact was, that Mr. Trotter had originally no fortune. He was a man of a good family in the part of the country to which he belonged; but lord Melville knew when he first began to patronize him that he had no property but what he derived from his salary as paymaster of the navy. It was absolute equivocation then to pretend that lord Melville could be ignorant of Mr. Trotter making use of the public money to a vast amount. He condemned, as extremely suspicious, Mr. Trotter's acting as lord Melville's agent. When Mr. Trotter, the paymaster and agent of lord Melville, was known to have extensive dealings with Mark Sprott a stock-broker, was not the inference the most natural that their dealings were mutual? Would not people have a right to presume that lord Melville shared in the profits of those speculations, to which there seemed every reason to think that he was accessary?&#x2014;But, indeed, it was not easy to see how this conclusion could be evaded. Was lord Melville ready on oath to disclaim such a connexion, or that he had ever derived the slightest advantage from any speculation in which Mr. Trotter was engaged? What was the language of all the predecessors and successors of Lord Melville? When the paymaster of Mr. Barr&#x00E9; was asked, whether he had received any emolument from the application of the public money? he readily answers&#x2014;No. Had lord Bayning received any advantage? Had lord Harrowby?&#x2014;No. Had Mr. Bragge? Had Mr. Tierney?&#x2014;No. Lord Melville is compelled to give evasive answers. He shelters273himself behind the confidential communications of government. He can afford no information, for his papers were destroyed. He has no recollection of what took place only a few years ago. The noble lord was remarkable for his retentive memory. He could reckon up, with accuracy unexampled, all our losses or our victories during the late contest. The right hon. gentleman opposite had not unfrequently derived the benefit of the noble lord's memory, when recollection was not of the most trifling moment. Yet here the noble lord's recollection totally forsook him, and certainly such an instance of weak recollection was not a little remarkable. Surely it was no great effort of memory to recollect whether profit had ever been received from the use of the public money, and a simple monosyllable was sufficient to state that recollection. Unfortunately this monosyllable was absent, at a moment when it was most wanted. Mr. Trotter's answers, too, respecting lord Melville, were of the most damning description. Did you receive any emolument from the use of the public money?&#x2014;I won't tell you. Did you know of the amount of the sums advanced for the confidential service of government?&#x2014;I won't tell you. Did lord Melville authorize you to use the public money for private emolument?&#x2014;I won't tell you. Did lord Melville share with you in any profit arising from such a use of the public money?&#x2014;I won't tell you. Here the hon. gentleman read and commented on lord Melville's evidence, and adverted to the case of Jelicoe, who had been suffered to remain a public debtor for a whole year, after he was known to be in arrears upwards of twenty-four thousand pounds. During the next year eleven thousand pounds more arrears had accrued. He had a strong suspicion that Jelicoe was in the same partnership with Mark Sprott, Mr. Alexander Trotter, and his lordship. It would not have been fair to have turned too short on an old companion. It would have perhaps too been dangerous, since unpleasant discoveries might have met the public eye. It looked very much as if, mutually conscious of criminality, they had agreed to be silent and keep their own secrets.&#x2014;Mr. Whitbread next commented on the last letter of lord Melville, which rather aggravated than palliated his guilt. His lordship even admitted the violation of the act of parliament. He allowed274that Mr. Trotter employed the public money for private emolument, but he denied his generally participating in the profit of such application. This denial was nothing. It was not that fair open denial which was the only test of innocence. The hon. gent. then apologised for having. exhausted the patience of the house in going through the statements which he had deemed it necessary to submit, to make the subject so intelligible as he could wish. If in the course of his investigation he had departed from that moderation which he had professed at his outset, and which it had unquestionably been his object to preserve, he should feel extremely sorry. He was happy, however, in supposing, unpleasant as his task had been, that he must have a majority of the members of that house to support him in the resolutions which he had that night to propose. A wound had been inflicted on the very existence of the country, which it was the duty of every member of the house to see checked and punished. When he turned his eves to the country gentlemen, those guardians of the public purse, he could not doubt of receiving their cordial support, in opposition to a principle of peculation which had been successfully practised on the public of Great Britain for many years, and that, too, by persons entrusted with the official conduct of its resources. If he looked to the officers of the army or navy, who composed part of the house, he knew that there was not one of them who would vote in support of a system of corruption, such as had been practised by the persons against whom his inquiry was directed. He was convinced that their minds were not tainted with such sordid and corrupt notions as to induce them to support public peculators. If he turned to the commercial men, he was satisfied that they were not filled with horror and disgust alone, but even with trembling, at the conduct which he had now endeavoured to point out, by which it was possible that ruin might have been hurled on them. Even as it was, had not the speculations of Mr. Trotter injured many of them? And might they not have injured not only the mercantile interests of the country, but also have been productive of great loss to the public in general? Would it have been a vindication of Aslett, supposing his speculations had been more fortunate than they ultimately turned out, to have come forward and said, \"there is your money275back again&#x2014;you are not injured&#x2014;you have no right to complain&#x2014;I only took an accommodation from you, by which you have lost nothing, and you have no right to pass any punishment on me for so trivial and innocent an offence?\" Such, surely, would, to gentlemen acquainted with mercantile affairs, be an excuse provoking only indignation and resentment. Or would it be esteemed a better argument to allege that the books and other documents from which it might have been possible to have cast some light on the accounts, had been burnt or intentionally destroyed? An allegation of this kind must with them meet with equal respect and attention. Every day of their lives, they were called on to prosecute for offences of less magnitude. Would the right hon. and learned gent. who presided in a court of equity; would another right hon. and learned gent. whose duty it more particularly was to prosecute for delinquencies, and who did think it so incumbent on him to check even the appearance of corruption, as to prosecute a person in an inferior rank of life for an attempt to bribe a right hon. gent. then at the head of administration (now lord Sidmouth);&#x2014;would they attempt to palliate a business of this kind, or would they not rather feel it their duty to join with him, and assist in bringing delinquents of a higher order also to justice? He begged gentlemen to keep in view the distressed state of the country in general. The opulent were obliged to part with their superfluities; and, from the nobleman to the peasant, every one was obliged to make corresponding sacrifices. We were told, indeed, that such were necessary for our salvation; but, in a case like the present, it was the duty of that house and of the public to be satisfied that our resources, so painfully raised, were not thrown away by improper management.

He had never heard the right hon. gent. with more surprise, than when he had accused his hon. friend of travelling out of the road of facts, to inflame the passions of the house, although the resolutions were composed entirely of facts, and the speech principally of deductions from facts. Another accusation against his hon. friend was one which might be thought not very consistent with inflaming passion, that he had loaded his speech with a complication of figures, But if his hon. friend had travelled out of the road of facts, had not the right hon. gent. in his view of the case, omitted facts, and those the most essential, on which the whole strength of the question rested? Had he not forgot that lord Melville had, by his own confession, proved that money had, with his knowledge, been drawn from the bank and placed at a private banker's? Had he not forgot, that lord Melville himself admitted, that he applied to other services, money issued for the service of the navy? Had he not forgot, that lord Melville had found himself unable to deny, that he had connived at his paymasters reaping private and illegal profit from the use of public funds? Was this complication of figures? Were they not, on the contrary, plain and important facts, which no subsequent inquiry could do away, no other evidence or examination of evidence could shake or invalidate; unless, indeed, that could be believed of lord Melville, which, even after all that had passed, would hardly be imputed to him, that he would wantonly forswear himself, and declare that to be false before one tribunal which he had declared to be true before another,&#x2014;The right hon. gent. had endeavoured to extenuate the guilt of290the noble viscount, by stating, that the public had suffered no loss. He could neither admit the argument nor the inference to be founded. If no loss had been suffered, a great risque of loss had been incurred. But the right hon. gent. contended, that no loss from anticipation could have taken place, because the forms of office rendered it impossible that money should be drawn for before it was wanted. He would not pretend to follow the right hon. gent. through the forms of office, with which he was so much better acquainted, but he would put this dilemma to him: if money could not be obtained till it was due for navy services, how was the money obtained with which other departments had been accommodated by the treasurer of the navy, which the right hon. gent. admitted in another part of his speech, and was willing to proclaim, that a part of them had passed through his own hands? Why, then, it was plain, that either by some means or other, money could he drawn by the paymaster of the navy, before it was wanted for navy services, or the navy service must itself have been left in distress for want of its necessary supply, which would only be an aggravation of guilt. Thus means were discovered to procure money before it was called for; and this path once entered upon, let the house consider to what length it might be carried. But it was contended, that the speculations in which the money was employed, had at least been successful. For this it was not impossible to account. Let it be remembered, how the persons were situated who were thus connected together. Mr. Mark Sprott, the broker, confidentially employed by Mr. Trotter, the paymaster; Mr. Trotter, the paymaster, confidentially employed by lord Melville; and lord Melville confidentially employed for the public. He had heard of jacobin combinations, and other combinations; but it would be difficult to imagine a combination more detrimental to the public, than that of these three persons, which touched the cabinet on one side and the stocks on the other. What changes of fortune, what convulsions in finance, was it not capable of effecting! But that which he thought would alone afford ground for the house to proceed immediately, was the systematic deception practised by lord Melville, by which he, eluded any inquiry that was instituted into his office, and most especially his declarations to the committee of finance. To that committee the right hon. person who was at the head of it, and now so honorably filled the chair291of this house, might recollect, that he had stated, that by the institution of the, accountant's branch, all the old arrears would be brought up, and a prompt mode of settling established for the future. But did he tell them, that as soon as the accountant had settled the balances of the other ex-treasurers, when he came to those of the right hon. Henry Dundas, he was to be withdrawn, and employed in other business?. Did he tell them, that a period of 7 years would be allowed to elapse, between the final settlement of the accounts immediately preceding, and any attempt to investigate those of his own treasurership? But he had gone still further. He had positively affirmed to the committee of finance, that by the regulations he had introduced, the intention of the beneficial acts that had been passed was carried into full effect; although at the time he made this affirmations he must have known, that the principal, and avowed object and purpose of the acts in question, that of transferring the custody of the public money from the treasurer of the navy to the bank, was at that moment directly and grossly violated, and that not accidentally for a particular occasion, but had been so, systematically and constantly, for a period of ,10 years. Did not such wanton misrepresentation call for an immediate expression of the indignation of the house? He was at a loss to conceive, where the difference could be seen between this case, and that of any private gentleman with his agent or steward. Let it be supposed that Mr. Mark Sprott, in answer to any inquiries that might have been made by Mr. Trotter, had told him, that he was not quite certain whether he did not sometimes vest money of Mr. Trotter's in his own name, that he might occasionally have placed some of the interest, when he received it, to his own account: could any one imagine, that after such an answer Mr. Sprott would long have remained broker to lord Melville or Mr. Trotter? But, perhaps, Mr. Sprott might have said, that he did it unintentionally, and that it was the necessary result of the manner in which he kept his accounts. Some one might exclaim; what broker on the exchange would keep his accounts in such a manner! To this he would answer: what treasurer of the navy of Great-Britain would keep his accounts in such a manner; and had not the people of England, who paid the public servants largely and liberally, and in no instance, perhaps, more largely and liberally than in that of the office now be-292fore the house, had not they a right to be served with as much accuracy, and as much fidelity, as any gentleman who employs a broker on the stock-exchange? It was impossible for the house to recognize innocence when guilt was professed. When he considered the examination of lord Melville, the letter of lord Melville to the commissioners, and most of all, the extraordinary letter which had been addressed to them subsequent to the report, he was reminded of Cicero's address to Piso, when after enumerating the various proofs of his misconduct, he breaks off, and exclaims, \"Quis te miserior? Quis te damnatior. Qui neque scribere ad senatum de te rempublicam bene esse gestam, neque pr&#x00E6;sens dicere ausus es.\"&#x2014;If when lord ,Melville first, introduced his bill in 1785, such member of this house had arisen, and addressing his lordship, with something of a prophetic spirit, had said, \"I oppose your bill, and the resolution of the house on which it is founded; but your labour is vain, your scheme is useless, for 2 years will not have past, before there will be found treasurer of the navy, who will wantonly and successfully violate the bill, and that treasurer. will be yourself:\" with what apparently just indignation would the noble lord have repelled so foul an assertion upon his character? Yet such was the case. But what should we say; if such a person had carried his conjectures further, though it was to be hoped with a spirit less prophetic, and said, \"still more useless is your plan, still more vain is your labour; because, when this violation of law, after having been systematically carried on for 14 years, during which the public expenditure will have doubled or tripled in its amount, shall at last, by a happy coincidence of circumstances come to be discovered, there will be found another house of commons, so different from that in which we sit, so indifferent to the care of the public purse, and so lost to every feeling of public duty, that they will turn away from the discovery, and readily embrace any pretence that is offered to them, to avoid .pronouncing an opinion on an act so gross, so flagrant, so unjustifiable.\" This last conjecture, he trusted, would not receive the same confirmation with the former. It would be fortunate, indeed, for the country, had this commission never been appointed, and these abuses never been discovered, if the result was to be, that these reports were to lay a dead letter on the table, to prove and to proclaim, that although there might exist in293this country a minister virtuous enough to institute inquiry, although there might be found persons honest and assiduous in conducting it, there was after and behind all this, a power able and willing to interpose between justice and its object, to step in between the law and the offender against the law and thereby to establish at once the most fatal and the most shameful of all precedents, that of guilt known and acknowledged but not censured, of a breach of the law ascertained but not punished. He trusted, that the event of this night would teach a very different lesson to the world; that it would shew, that whatever difference might exist amongst us, if indeed there did exist any, on the principles of government, or on the application of those principles to public measures, yet when such questions as these came to be determined, whether the law should or should not be observed, whether the public expenditure should be watched, or should pass unexamined and uncontrolled, there was to be found but one voice, one opinion, and one cause: the cause of men of all descriptions, who pretend to any sort of principle, in opposition to those who either do not profess any, or what is as dangerous, if not as bad, who think none essential to the honour, the safety, and the existence of the country.", "author_id": "/people/lord-henry-petty", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1805", "apr", "08"], "content": "complimented his noble friend. It was a matter of pride to any man to be allowed to call himself the friend of such rising talents and eloquence. He agreed with him that nothing was more fit than to appoint a committee after the first point should be agreed upon, a committee in which all that related to accounts and calculations might be sifted arid made clear. The transfer of money from one service to another was also matter for a committee, but what was to be done with the remainder of the tenth report? Did lord Melville ask for further delay, saying he had evidence sufficient for his acquittal? Did Mr. Trotter say any thing to that effect? But the people of England looked to this night for the opinion of their representatives on this important case. He would ask the right hon. gent. how long it was since the expedient of a reference to a committee occurred to him? The right hon. gent. was anxious for the production of lord Melville's letter, and still more, that the public mind should be set at rest on this point before the Easter recess. Why send to a committee that which no committee of that house could, throw any fresh light upon? Could any man in that house lay his hand to his heart, and say he could controvert those propositions? Would any evidence disprove that money had been drawn from the bank contrary to law? Would Mr. Sprott say now what he would not say before? Would he be open-mouthed when not on his oath, and close when sworn? No farther explanation could be given. He then reminded the house of the report of the committee on the late sheriffs of Middlesex, when the committee made their report, which was received as full evidence, and counsel were merely as a supplementary explanation. Would any man in being, he asked, say that lord Melville, Mr. Trotter, or Mr. Mark Sprott, by an after examination of the facts, could add any thing for the satisfaction of the house? His right hon. and learned friend had gone over the whole of the case, and pressed the necessity of a select committee; but the commissioners of naval inquiry had been occupied for 6 months in no other business than that of investigating the matters of the tenth report. What utility could it then be of, to go into a new com-295mittee? he wished to see what reason could be urged for it. The right hon. gent. Appeared anxious to know the extent of the deficiencies, not for the purposes of criminating, but for the purposes of refunding, as appeared from his enumeration of the several sums paid and received. The money was not kept in the bank; no, says the right hon. gent., it was lodged at Messrs. Coutts, to save trouble: a clerk of the navy office takes a cheque for a large amount, receives the value at the bank of England, passes Somerset-house, and carries it down to Messrs. Coutts. This was the convenience. He did not want any further illustration of the fallacy of the pretence.&#x2014;One point more he begged leave to advert to. While he had the honour of holding the office of treasurer of the navy, no inconvenience whatever arose from a strict adherence to the act of parliament, which was one of the most salutary and useful ever framed, nor could he see how it was possible Mr. Trotter could see any thing in the act which could leave the least doubt upon his mind of the true spirit and meaning of it.&#x2014;With respect to the participation of the emoluments by lord Melville, with Mr. Trotter, there did not remain a doubt upon his mind on that part of the case. Was it possible for lord Melville to go on as he did, for 12 years, merely for the advantage of Mr. Trotter? He could not be blind to the rising prosperity of Mr. Trotter; he knew he originally had nothing; and this alone should have been sufficient to rouse his jealousy. The accommodation of 10,000l. of 20,000l., and various other considerable sums, left not a shadow of doubt upon the subject; and it fully appeared his lordship had gone on systematically for 12 years together. He hoped it could not be said he was actuated by any peevish motive to lord Melville in giving his vote in support of the resolutions that night. Nothing would satisfy the country but meeting the question fairly, broadly, distinctly, and without delay. The public understood the question as well as those who made speeches for his lordship; but what defence could the house make to the public, if they delayed or passed by the consideration of such transactions? As to impeding sailors' wages by these speculations, he wished to state it publicly, from having been in the office himself, that such a report, which he hoped had not been made, was groundless, as the thing was impossible. But he must add, that in such a war as this, the loss of public confidence, and of the respect the people pay to296high authority, would be the worst blow that could be inflicted on this country. He would be the last man to proceed harshly against lord Melville or Mr. Trotter, but they did not ask to be heard by counsel, or pray for any delay. Their friends allowed they could not ask for an acquittal upon the tenth report: and, therefore, why go out of the way and delay the business for 3 or 6 months? The house of commons would only incur odium by such a step. Shew him the law was not violated, or he would not consent to a moment's delay. This was an odd way of treating the parliamentary commissioners. The right hon. gent. Had said there was no regular trial, and had described all the forms of a trial. In this case the witnesses were the accounts of the persons accused, and the parties were called upon, and had every opportunity given them. \"Can you make out the answer in June?\" \"No.\"&#x2014;\"Can you do it in July?\" \"No.\" \"Have you any thing to say or to shew in your favour?\" \"Nothing.\" The trial was as fair as the nature of the transaction admitted. What more trial could they have before the committee of the house? Was this sort of language used respecting the report of the commissioners of accounts? As to the errors the right hon. gent. Had endeavoured no argument of weight against the commissioners, since the very documents on which the right hon. gent. Reasoned were furnished by the commissioners themselves. It was his pride that he had been a member of the last administration, to which that commission of inquiry was owing; and he called on all those gentlemen who supported that administration, particularly in that measure, to come forward now and support the commissioners in the hour of their need.&#x2014;When the right hon. gent had concluded, the Master of the Rolls and Mr. Canning rose at the same time, but Mr. Canning first caught the eye of the speaker.", "author_id": "/people/mr-george-tierney", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1805", "apr", "08"], "content": "said, that on any other occasion he should undoubtedly have given way to his hon. and learned friend, but after the speech he had just heard from the high authority of the hon gent. Whom he had succeeded in the office he now held, and considering that the present question related peculiarly to that department of administration which he was most intimately connected with, he felt particularly anxious to deliver his sentiments on this occasion. He observed that the house, in its usual love of justice, would give an opportunity to297inquire, whether the whole of the charge now exhibited against the noble lord might not be done away, or was capable of being done away? And if they thought so they could not possibly vote for the motion proposed by the hon. gent. But what was the alternative? That the house should come to a final determination on the subject, by which all possibility of explanation would be excluded. Now, upon that subject he could not help saying, that the mode proposed by his right hon. friend was the true way to answer the purpose of justice, by instituting an inquiry, with all the circumstances of the case on both sides, which hitherto had not been done. But the right hon. gent. Who spoke last had stated to the house, that the mode proposed by the original motion was recommended by a late precedent in the proceedings of the house on the subject of the Middlesex election; in that case the house had decided that it would not proceed in the examination of evidence at the bar, but took up the case on the report of a committee, and adopted its statement upon the ground that the evidence which was adduced before the committee was upon oath, and that which was to be heard at the bar must be without oath&#x2014;that the case was the same here, for that the evidence before the committee of naval inquiry was upon oath, but if the house heard any further evidence upon that subject, they must take it without that sanction. Now, begging pardon of that right hon. gent., the two cases had no common nature, or indeed any resemblance to each other. The decision on the late case of the Middlesex election, in which the house had adopted the report of the committee, and concluded upon it without hearing further evidence, did not turn on the point of difference between evidence upon oath and that which was taken without that sanction; but upon the principle, that the parties charged with misconduct had been fully heard, had been allowed all the forms, and what was much better than all forms, the substance of a fair trial; they were called upon to answer; they knew the charge, had heard all the evidence in support of it, had actually cross-examined that evidence, and were heard by counsel as to the effect of that evidence, and it appeared, upon full investigation of the case, that the party had nothing to say in answer to the charge; they were found guilty, because their guilt was fully substantiated, after they had been fully heard. But the present was the reverse of that case, for here the298party had not been heard, and all that was now asked was a full hearing. And here he would put it to the house, and, indeed, to the gentlemen opposite to him, whether it was fair to call on the house to convict the party without a hearing, which had not yet been had? and what would bring the point more distinctly before the minds of those whom he had now the honour of addressing was this, that no part of the case now before the house on this report was matter originally intended by the course of examination taken by the committee, but it came out incidentally, and it was no part of the object of the committee to try the noble lord who was the object of the present motion for any thing, and therefore it was, from the nature of things, absolutely impossible that he should have had a fair trial, since he had indeed hitherto had no trial. But the right hon. gent. Who spoke last had observed, that in former times a committee, on the model of which this was formed, had made many wise regulations, and that the act which was now the subject of the consideration of the house of commons passed without further investigation than that of a perusal of the report of the committee on which it was founded. This might be, but he believed the right hon. gent. could not shew him any regulation of parliament by which any individual had been condemned, without having had an opportunity of defending himself. And here the case was mot singularly hard, for it was the case of an individual knowing for the first time from the report, now said to be conclusive, what was the nature of the charge which was exhibited against him. He was speaking now of lord Melville, for he understood that noble lord was the only person against whom gentlemen on the other side of the house were pressing. From these complicated accounts, thus brought without notice to his lordship, before the committee, the guilt of that noble lord was to be inferred; and he was said to have had a fair trial! and the house was called upon to confirm that assertion, without its having at all investigated the case! This application to the house was repugnant to the principles of justice.&#x2014;But then the right hon. gent. stated, that an act of parliament had in this case been violated by the application of public money to other uses than those specified by the act. Now he ventured to say, the violation of the act of parliament was a point by no means so clear as some gentlemen affected to state it; but on the contrary299he believed that doubts might be very reasonably entertained upon that subject. Here he wished to guard against, being misunderstood. When he said that the act was not so clear upon this point as it seemed to be conceived by some gentlemen, he was, not thereby to he regarded as the champion of illegal defiance to the rules of law, or an imitator of such a practice. He knew that laws even if unwise, must be obeyed, while they were in full force. But the question was, whether the party here said to be guilty of a breach of the law, knew that he was really causing to be applied the public money to the private use of individuals? Now, considering the law as attentively as he was able, he denied that either the letter, or the spirit of it, prohibited the drawing of money out of the Bank in the manner contended for by gentlemen on the other side of the house. He was confident that the spirit of the act could not be so, because it could never have been the intention of any law to throw insurmountable obstacles in the way of public business; and he contended that the strict letter of the act could not be so construed; for, in many cases, a compliance with an act, so construed would be physically impossible. In the course of 26 days the amount of the sums to be paid to claimants on the navy was 6,400l.; 3,500l; of which was made up of sums under 20l. A great multitude of the items were from 8s. 6d. to 1l. 8s. He wished gentlemen to turn this in their minds&#x2014;whether all these sums could be paid by drafts immediately given to the claimants to receive the money at the Bank? And if this were so, he wished gentlemen, who maintained the affirmative of that proposition, to shew him the clause in the act by which it was supported; and when they had done so, they would have proved that every person who held the office of paymaster of the navy since the passing of the act had been guilty of an infraction of it. After all, if the law was so, the breach of it was of course not to be justified; but then came the question of the degree of impropriety of the conduct of the individual, and much of that depended upon the question of&#x2014;whether he did it knowingly and unnecessarily? To pursue the idea of convenience in transacting public business of this kind a little further, he would observe, there were now 6,800 ships books for payment, and in the course of the last three weeks payment had been made upon 40 ships books, and they abounded with items of.14s., 12s., and 15s. 9d. Now he would300ask, whether it was to be contended by any gent. in that house, with any regard to practicability in the dispatch of business, that every one of these items should be paid by a distinct specific draft upon the Bank given to the claimant? If not, then there was an end of the argument upon the dry point of the illegality of drawing money out of the Bank for any but a specified purpose for the use of the navy! Thus the argument upon the illegality of the practice fell to the ground. Then the question of strictness of law being at an end, the rest was a question of degree, or extent to which the practice had been carried, and that, like every other, must be governed by that which was reasonable; for he did not say that it might with impunity be carried to a blameable extent, or be endlessly followed up. It would be always just to mark it with censure whenever it was done unnecessarily. But he said it was not a question of mere law, as gentlemen on the other side of the house took it, but a question of degree. That was to be determined upon the circumstances, and the house should judge, or rather a committee should judge, how far it. was necessary or unnecessary, and which the house possessed the power of deciding after a proper inquiry had been had into all the circumstances of the case, but no such proceeding had hitherto taken place. The diversion of the public money, which was another topic brought forward, was very fit for inquiry. As to the charge, or rather an imputation, founded upon an inference, against the noble lord; that he had some participation of the benefit arising from the use of the public money while employed for the advantage of private individuals, that was a subject fit for inquiry, but to decide which, the house, at present, had no materials; and upon the question of the extent to which the public money had been drawn out from the Bank and here he must advert to a part of the report of the committee of 1782, which had escaped the notice of the hon. gent. who brought forward the motion, which was to the following effect: \"we consider that this excess is not money for which the treasurer is accountable to the public, but belonging to the proprietors of these bills, and remaining in his. hands at their risk, until they apply to him for payment.\" Now, he said, if this doctrine be correct, the whole money in the hands of the treasurer was not that for which he was responsible to the public, but to the individual to which these sums belonged, and if they had, received301their money upon application, there had been no breach of the act of parliament, and the house would find, upon inquiry, that what he had. stated hypothetically was the facts.&#x2014;He maintained that the deficiency stated in page 128 of the Report was incorrectly stated as to the amount of it. He did not say that the mode stated on the other side was the proper mode of keeping the money of the public; but what he contended was, that the case was not that case of aggravation which was contended for on the other side. It was, however, a matter which he did not ask gentlemen to take on his statement, but leave it for inquiry; for that he believed it would turn out that the violation of the act of parliament in this respect, so much insisted upon, was in a great measure imaginary.&#x2014;He now came to the great point, which was, the imputation to the noble lord that he had participated in the use of the public money. This was not made as a distinct charge, only it was thrown out, or insinuated as a matter of inference. Now, he would put it to the conscience of the hon. gent., who brought forward this motion, and to use language already uttered in the course of this debate, to lay his hand upon his heart, and ask himself, whether he could believe that out of the monies which had been drawn out of the Bank, the noble lord had really any participation in the profits of using for private purposes? And whether he believed that a vote, carried to the extent of that now proposed, in deference, as that hon. gent. might think, to the public opinion, would not be to confirm such opinion to its full extent? He would ask whether that was fair? Whether the carrying the motion now before the house, would not be to impress upon the minds of the public an idea that lord Melville had been found guilty by the house of commons of foul and corrupt malversation? (A cry of hear! hear! from the opposite side.) If gentlemen really thought so, they were right in pressing the motion; but he was at a loss to find out upon what foundation such a conclusion could be drawn from the premises before the house; for the case could not, even on the face of the report, before the other side was heard, amount to any thing more than a case of suspicion. He would then ask the hon. gent. what he would think of the hardship of that case, if hereafter it should appear as he believed it would, that the suspicion was without foundation?&#x2014;He then pro-302ceeded to :observe on that part of the report of the commissioners, in which they disapprove of the manner in which the accountants' branch, consisting of principal and eight clerks having been established by order of council in: Aug. 1786, for the express purpose of bringing up the old, and keeping up the new accounts; and they were surprised this had not been done, but that the clerks had been employed in the current business of the pay-office; and on which the committee said, this was a false economy. He admitted that no economy was more pitiful than that of starving the public service by a paucity of clerks in public offices; but there was erroneous conception on this subject. It was generally considered, that the power of the treasurer of the navy was much greater than it was, he was considered as a kind of despot in the office, when in truth he could neither add to the number of the clerks nor to their salary This economy, pitiful as it might be, was not the economy of lord Melville, for he had applied to the admiralty for additional clerks for the accountant's branch, and they were not allowed. Since lord Melville became first lord of the admiralty, he had applied, and these clerks were allowed long before the commissioners suggested the necessity of them. There was another detached point, upon which great stress was laid and which seemed to be considered a material feature in the case. He meant the circumstance of Mr. Trotter having drawn 1 million in one day from the bank, and lodged it in the house of Messrs. Coutts. His right hon. friend (Mr. Pitt) had said, that much doubt lay upon this transaction, and that it might admit of explanation. Now he should go farther. He would undertake to explain it satisfactorily. The fact then was, that this million was not the whole sum drawn that day. He begged the house not to be startled when he stated how the case was. The fact was, it was part of a sum of 2&#x00BD; millions drawn upon the same day, viz. the 10th of April. Of this due intimation was given in the Gazette by the commissioners of the navy and victualling office, stating, that treasurer of the navy had that day received money for the services of these departments for 6 months, and giving the creditors an option of money or bills, as they should think proper. The next day, the 11th, these 2&#x00BD; millions were offered to the persons having any demands against these several departments, and therefore there was nothing secret or clandestine in the transaction. The303next detached charge particularly concerned himself. It had been insinuated out of doors, in consequence of something contained in the report, that he, as treasurer of the navy had thrown obstructions in the way of jnquiry. The right hon. gent. here entered into a justification of his own conduct. He said, he had been called upon by the commissioners to furnish four several lists, but, on consideration, he found he could not furnish more than three, and even these not in the precise form required. These three, however, he did furnish in the most complete form in his power, from the documents which his office afforded; and for any further information upon the subject he referred the commissioners to the books of his department, The report, however, in noticing this transaction, and his first answer, goes on to say, \"his accounts were afterwards made out,\" implying, as he conceived, that they were at first refused. Having said thus much, however, he hoped he should not be suspected of having thrown any impediment in the way of the commissioners, to whose object, fairly and liberally pursued, no man was a greater friend than he. He added, that he wished to stand well in the opinion of the house and of the public. He concluded by observing, that if he thought this motion well founded, that a case was made out against the noble lord, he should not lift up his voice against such a motion; but he thought he did not ask too much, when he asked the house not to suffer itself by prejudice within, or by intimidation from clamour without, to take upon itself to decide without full and competent information upon the question now before them.", "author_id": "/people/mr-george-canning", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1805", "apr", "08"], "content": "rose, and spoke to the following effect:&#x2014;Sir, I am satisfied that the right hon. gent. who spoke last, thinks, as he speaks, that there is matter in this business, highly deserving of the most serious consideration of this house. I am sure he thinks it a question highly deserving of a committee, for the purpose of proving the innocence and purity of Mr. Trotter; for, from all I have heard of his character, I am certain if he did not think Mr. Trotter pure and innocent, he would not continue him in office. I think it right, sir; to quote the right hon. gent.'s conduct, in proof of his sincerity; for, I am sure he would not vote for farther delay, if not from a consciousness that it was necessary to the exculpation of Mr. Trotter. He surely would not. continue him in office, or act in any way, merely for the purpose of screening an304accused person from justice. But while I give the right hon. gent. credit for all this candour and regard for truth, there is one circumstance which strikes me as somewhat extraordinary. The right hon. gent. through the whole of his speech, uses the phrase, 'this charge,' as if it were limited to one. Now, this is an error; for there are several distinct and separate charges comprised in the offence. For example, one of the heads of accusation is, that lord Melville, the very, man. who proposed the law in question, and afterwards treasurer of the navy, did violate the provisions of that law, by conniving at the conduct of his paymaster taking the public money from the bank, and applying it to his own private profit and emolument. Is not this single, distinct, and substantive charge? Has this any thing to do, in the, remotest degree, with accommodation afforded to another office? or with the charge of a participation of gain with lord Melville? Is not this, then, a distinct and separate accusation? and, if so, how does it become necessary to its ascertainment, to inquire what office received the loan; or whether Mr. Trotter divided the profits with lord Melville? The right hon. gent. pursuing this error, says, as a reason for farther time, and inquiry, it is difficult to decide upon complex and intricate accounts, meaning thereby the accounts of Mr. Trotter Sir, these accounts have nothing to do with the charge which I have stated. I ask the house, will they, after 10 years of consideration and examination, enable you to say, that lord Melville did not connive at Mr. Trotter, his paymaster, taking money out of the bank, and applying it to the purposes of, private emolument? You know they will not; and, therefore, as to this charge, no delay is necessary. But it has been said, that the accounts are not correct; as it will appear that the sums transferred to the bank of Messrs. Coutts were only 7 or 8 millions, and not 15, as therein stated. But how will this, admitting the fact to be so, acquit that noble personage of corrupt connivance at the breach of the law? Is he innocent, because he only connived at the misapplication of 7 millions of the public money? The next objection urged is, that the charge against the noble lord and Mr. Trotter is supported only byex parteevidence. Why, this is indeed curious objection. The gentlemen chuse favorite terms for themselves, and then they quarrel with their own phrase. It is indeedex parteevidence, but of what party? Is it of the accuser? no. It is the evidence of the305party accused stating every thing he thinks proper in his own defence and justification. But it has been said, that these parties have been hardly dealt with; they have been taken by surprise, and have had no notice of what was going forward. What! I thought that commission issued for the purpose of inquiring into abuses, with a view to correction and amendment. Have I been mistaken, and was it then for the purpose of inquiring into the transcendant merits and virtues of the treasurer and paymaster of the navy, and to ascertain what farther honours and rewards they deserved for their distinguished services? These worthy parties, it now seems, were most cruelly deceived. They attended the commissioners, never once dreaming that abuses could have crept into their office, which the commissioners wished to investigate, but fancying it was to be only an examination, to ascertain the degree of their merits and virtues, and confidently anticipating a brilliant reward. Now, to come to thisex parteevidence, as it is called: lord Melville being asked, did you permit Mr. Trotter to draw the money from the Bank of England, and place it in his private banker's hands? his lordship answers, \"I never gave him a direct authority, but I knew he did it.\" Now, surely, it would have been more manly in his lordship to have said at once \"I did,\" than to admit that he knew what was going on, and did not prevent it. It was skulling from his duty. It was as much as saying to Mr. Trotter, make money of your office as you can, and I will protect you. And who is this Mr. Trotter, with whom lord Melville cannot be presumed to have any fellow-feeling? Why, the general agent of lord Melville. Why, knowing him to be acting in this illegal way, did he continue him in the practice? Can any man believe it was exclusively for Mr. Trotter's sole benefit? But even though it were, lord Melville would not be the less responsible; as principal, he was as corrupt as if the act of his agent had been done personally by himself.&#x2014;The next argument advanced is that no loss has been sustained by the practice. This I can easily conceive, without giving the parties much credit for their innocence. Mr. Alexander Trotter is an expert calculator. He might know very well how far he might use the public money, before the demands for it should come round upon him. It was only the common science of every banker, who knows when his bills are payable, and to what amount, and regulates his issues in the mean time, according-306ly. This argument, of no loss to the public from this practice, is an extraordinary excuse from a right hon. gent. so well versed in the financial system of the country, and the laws that particularly relate to it. Does he re collect the act which prescribes the form of the bills, and the mode of drawing them? That act says, \"any man counterfeiting one of these bills, shall be guilt of a felony, without benefit of clergy.\" Now, suppose an expert forger, and many such there are, had forged a bill of 500,000l. but had the money to replace it when it became due; and supposing this transaction to be afterwards discovered, would or could the right hon. gent: advise his Majesty to pardon that man, because the money, was made good? To excuse, therefore, a public officer, guilty of mal-practices, upon the ground of no loss, is monstrous language. It is language that puts an end to the definite provisions of the law, and the constitution of the house of commons. What! no loss? Is then every public officer to speculate with the public money for private profit, and if no loss ensues, is there no criminality? What is the use of your laws, if they may be thus dispensed with at pleasure? What becomes of the house and its duties? Is the house to vote a sum of money for one particular service, and may any officer apply it to another as he pleas, and if no loss follows, is he to remain guiltless The right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer says he knows of one sum of 40,000l.that was thus applied to a purpose different from that for which it was voted, and he adds, judiciously applied. I ask, however, if any regard were paid to the votes of the house, why was not that payment afterwards disclosed, and a bill of indemnity demanded for those that made it? It is monstrous that any minister should think himself justified in taking such a liberty with the public money, and not call for a bill of indemnity. It said that the accounts are not correct; that the sums lodged with Messrs. Coutts are not so great as they are stated. This does not signify. It appears that Mr. Trotter took all he could. He was a good calculator; and if he took only 5 millions; instead of 15, it was because he could not make free with more. It is a proof of skill, not of his innocence, and, perhaps, it is for that skill he has been reinstated in office. Great pains, we are told, have been taken to inflame the public mind. It is said that hand-bills and publications have been circulated, for the purpose of exciting odium against the parties. If so, it is base.307The hon. gent. opposite (the, attorney general) will feel it his duty, I am sure, to ascertain the fact, and punish these libellers; but why are we to stop the proceedings of the house, because offensive and libellous publications have been circulated? The proceedings of the commissioners in 1782 have been referred to, but they have nothing to do with the present business. The question is, whether the act of 1785 has been violated? The conduct of the commissioners in 1782, he would venture to say, did not sanction the conduct of Mr. Trotter. Their recommendation was, that none of these public officers should have public money in their hands, or be exposed to the temptation of private gain, that might end in public loss. I cannot conceive why we should postpone the resolutions. Can you obtain evidence from a committee, that the law has not been violated? This is the first instance of an application to parliament in a grave business for delay, without stating any grounds. If you have any ground, why not state it? I think the gentlemen are not aware of the consequences of delay, if any is to take place. In such event, I think bills ought to be bought in to restrain lord Melville and Mr. Trotter from leaving the country. The proceedings of a committee will occupy a great length of time. What is to become of lord Melville and Mr. Trotter in the mean while? If it shall appear that the sums have been great, it will not be fit that they should be allowed to walk the streets at large, and be at liberty to convey in trust to their friends those funds from which restitution ought to be made to the country. The right hon. gent. (Mr. Pitt) will therefore find it due to his character to follow the case of Sir Thomas Rumbold, and take care that any funds they now possess shall be forthcoming to satisfy the public demands. And now, sir, let me tell you, there never was a moment in the history of the country where the character of the government was so essential to its welfare and security. By a measure, of which I own I did not approve, this house has received an addition of 100 members from Ireland. I own, sir, I am anxious that they should give this night a proof of their spirit and purity. Public rumour stated that at the time of the union many were induced by large sums to part with their legislature too easily, and their integrity was not free from doubt and suspicion. They have now an opportunity of throwing from them that imputation. I should be deeply afflicted if that measure308were only to give the minister an increase of influence, and not of purity and virtue. I should be ashamed to walk the streets of London, if it were the general opinion that the members from Ireland were not as clear of corruption as the members of this country, and that there was any virtue in the one from which the other was shut out. Sorry should I be were the two representations to meet like two running sores, wasting the strength and vigour of the body by their confluent corruption. This is the first opportunity they have had of giving a proof of the virtue and integrity of my countrymen, and I hope they will not lose it. You are now engaged in a war alone, without an ally, with a great nation, led by the most extraordinary man the world has ever produced. You have imposed heavy taxes upon the people. This session you have followed the poor man's last luxury into his cottage; you have taxed his salt. Will it not then be wise to shew, that if you call upon him to make great sacrifices, you will take care that they shall be administered with integrity and economy? Is it not incumbent upon you to shew, that no rank, no power, no influence can screen a public malefactor? and that the man who would abuse his trust, and misapply the hard earnings of the people, cannot be screened from the justice of the country? When you have established this character, as I hope and trust you will this night, you may carry on the contest as long as you may think it necessary for your honour or your safety; but, if the amendment be adopted, you will incur a very different opinion. I put it to you, whether it will be considered as a mode to ascertain the innocence of a man, who stands convicted upon his own oath, or a stratagem to shelter him from punishment by delay? I can make great allowance for private friendship. I am sure, however, it is the sentiment of the house that lord Melville cannot be defended; for I observe that not one gentleman has arisen this night to speak for him, but such as have been his colleague in office. I cannot find fault with that friendship; but sure I am, that if they cannot acquit him upon oath, of what he has admitted upon oath, they can not acquit him of a corrupt breach of the law.", "author_id": "/people/mr-george-ponsonby-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

For if, unhappily, the vote of the house should be opposite to that which he hoped and wished, he should feel very uneasy indeed that his name should partake of the universal odium that must attach to any decision tending to second such notorious delinquency as the report on the table declared. He could never reconcile it to his mind to be silent upon such an occasion, lest he should be suspected of declining to mark with the strongest reprobation, guilt310of a nature so glaring, that any man who gave it the sanction of his vote, or attempted to protect it from punishment must be viewed in the light of an accomplice, or one at least disposed to become the accomplice of similar transactions. Before he would proceed to the merits of the charges under consideration, he thought it proper to notice the arguments of the gentlemen on the other side, not because he considered those arguments possessed of any intrinsic force, but lest from the authority of the persons from whom they proceeded they might have the effect of leading the house to a decision, which, if it should correspond with the wishes of those by whom such arguments were used, must destroy its character with the country and with all Europe. The first gentleman with whom he would begin was the last who spoke. That learned gent. directed the whole of his observations to shew that the house should go into a committee in order to ascertain whether the breach of the act of parliament, not of which lord Melville stood charged, but of which he confessed himself guilty, proceeded from corrupt motives. If corruption consisted merely in a man putting money into his own pocket, according to the vulgar conception, perhaps some of the deductions of the learned gent. would be right. But he would contend that nothing could be more corrupt, in his opinion, than to permit a man's own agent to convert the money of others to his own private emolument. This was the amount of lord Melville's confession; and although it might be possible, from a further examination, to prove the noble lord more guilty, it did appear to him utterly impossible to prove him less so. For the most conclusive evidence of the noble lord's corruption, he would only refer to that paragraph in the report, in which the noble lord stated, that although he knew his agent Trotter was applying the public money to other purposes than that for which it was legally intended, that he did not prohibit him from doing so. What was that, he would ask, but complete corruption, even taking the casesimpliciter;but combining it with other circumstances, could any man entertain a doubt upon the subject of his guilt? What greater aggravation of his delinquency in tolerating the breach of his own act of parliament could be imagined than allowing his agent to misapply the public money, for the safe custody of which that act was intended? But it is pretended that no loss had accrued to the public from this311malversation, and a very singular argument was advanced, that as there was no loss there was no risk. Now, said the hon. gent., it unfortunately happened in certain parts of my life, which I do not quote with a view to recommend my example to others, that I was in the habits of engaging in certain speculations which are commonly called gaming. If a man should, in that kind of speculation, win a large sum of money, I am sure that an argument would not thence arise that he had made no risk. I rather think the natural inference would be that his risk was considerable. Probably however, in this case, lord Melville did take care that Trotter should not lose any money. Trotter was the confidential agent of lord Melville, and lord Melville was the confidential agent of the state. Therefore, in this sort of speculation in which Trotter engaged, lord Melville could guard against much risk. If two men play at cards together, and a third person stands behind one of them and throws hints to the other, he that receives the hints is tolerably sure of winning. Just so in this business; lord Melville knew when the navy bills were likely to be funded, and Mr. Trotter could act upon the information he might receive. Will any one say, then, that from such acting upon such information, no loss would accrue to the public? On the contrary, I maintain, that the public did suffer a loss of 1 per cent. upon the discount of such bills. But, then observed the hon. member, the learned gent. desired the house to go into an inquiry, in order to obtain facther evidence. He would appeal to the judgment of the house, whether any farther evidence could be necessary to enable it to come to a decided opinion upon the breach of law, which the noble lord himself confessed? That opinion the house was called on to declare. The public had a right to demand from them. It was said, that the house ought not to think of acting judicially, of inflicting punishment without the fallest examination into the merits of the accusation, and affording the accused the fullest opportunity of vindicating himself. And so far as the confession of lord Melville went, he had been already tried. He would, however, fey those gentlemen who rested their objection so much upon the question of punishment, to shew, that it was at all in the power of that house to inflict any punishment on such delinquents as lord Melville and Trotter. But if the house should determine on prosecution in any way with a view to punishment; whether by directing312the attorney-general to prosecute; whether by moving an impeachment, or preparing a bill of pains and penalties, which perhaps would be the more proper mode of proceeding, he would maintain that the confession of the party accused, would be evidence to proceed upon, and that the house was now called on to act, as it must in every similar case, as a grand jury, to pronounce upon the guilt of the accused. It was strange to hear it asserted, that the accused was not guilty, because no loss had accrued from this scandalous transaction. To those to whom the loss of honour was nothing, perhaps, it might be said that no loss had arisen. But what was the loss of honour to that government which after such a palpable instance of delinquency, should preserve its connexions with the delinquent? and what the loss of character and honour to that house, should it attempt by its vote, to search such a delinquent? infinitely more than any sum of money could amount to&#x2014;Whatever the learned gent. to whom he had already adverted might assert, he could not see that any farther inquiry could be necessary to enable the house to decide that a great public officer who allowed his servants to make illicit profits from the public money, in the teeth of an act of parliament, was guilty of a most serious offence. The guilt consisted in the violation of the law, and it never could be pretended that any such violation could be innocent. There were, indeed, many cases in which the most severe punishments attached to offences to which the charge of moral turpitude did not apply, but which were criminal in consequence of the precept of the law. Such were many of the offences against our revenue laws. Not two years ago an act was passed declaring a man guilty of felony, without benefit of clergy, if paper of a certain sort should be found in his possession, this sort of paper being used for the manufacture of bank notes. Now, the reason of this statue was this, that a man could not be presumed to have such paper in his possession but with a criminal intention. Therefore the breach of the act was proof against him. And the act of the 25th of the king, which applied to the case under consideration, was drawn up upon a similar principle, and the breach of it was to be deemed the proof of the criminal intention. Upon this proof those which arose out of the reason of the law, he had no hesitation in pronouncing the noble lord guilty. At all events, there was no man who could say that strong suspicion,313did not attach to him. When private individuals became the objects of suspicion, it was their own affair; but when suspicion attached to men of high rank in the state, it became a matter of great public interest. Putting all the circumstances of the case together, he could not see that any thing could be obtained to avert the judgment of the house from farther inquiry. Whatever delay might take place, there was only one mode of confirming still farther the guilt of lord Melville, and that was in case Trotter should \"peach;\" but there was no mode or evidence possible to be imagined that could refute that which lord Melville himself confessed. On that confession then, he called upon the house to proceed, by adopting the motion of his hon. friend. With respect to the charge of lord Melville's having participated of the profits resulting from Trotter's application of the public money, he could not say that there was direct evidence before the house; but there certainly was strong ground of suspicion. The noble lord, it would be recollected, retained the office of treasure of the navy for several years after he was appointed to that of secretary of state, and when in that house allusion was made to the circumstance of his holding the two offices, the answer from the other side of the house was, that although he held those offices, he only received the salary of secretary of state, and nothing from the treasury of the navy. Ay, that is nothing of the legal salary. Did not this justify something more than suspicion? Why should the noble lord so fondly cling to this office of his friend, Mr. Trotter? There were many other persons among even his own relations who would have been glad to occupy this situation. But no; lord Melville seemed particularly attached to it, and would any man of common sense, in considering a thing of this kind, make no inference from that attachment. Another objection arose against the proposed committee, from this consideration, that he did not see that any of the difficulties which some gentlemen complain of could be removed; that any of the obscure accounts could be explained. Those accounts were indeed of such a nature, that the parties themselves could not understand them, and how, then, could it be possible for a committee of that house to make any thing of them?&#x2014;It had been said that the house should proceed with the utmost deliberation in deciding upon character. But upon whose character were they to decide on314this occasion? Not, upon that of lord Melville, for his character was entirely gone; but upon the character of the house and the government, which must depend upon the vote of this night. As to the character of lord Melville it was so completely destroyed in public estimation for ever, that he would venture to say, that were the vote of the house unanimous in his favour, it would not have the slightest effect in wiping away the stigma that was universally affixed to his name. What, then, must the world think of retaining such a man at the head of the glory of the country? It was dreadful to reflect that the most honourable claims should be placed at the disposal of a man, with whose name dishonour was inseparably associated&#x2014;who had confessed himself guilty of an act of corrupt illegality.&#x2014;Are we, said the hon. gent., to connive at and approve of all this, when even the right hon. gent. who has moved the previous question, will not go the length of approving all he has done. Sir, we have heard to-night, with sentiments of exultation, the brilliant efforts of a noble friend of mine (lord H. Petty) on the bench behind me: there is not a man in the house capable of appreciating virtue and genius, who did not feel a secret satisfaction in the speech of that noble lord. I recollect, sir, when the right hon. gent. on the opposite bench (Mr. Pitt) made his first essay in this house, I recollect, and many in the house must recollect also, the just pride which we all felt to see him, much at the same age then that the noble lord behind me now is, distinguishing himself in hunting down corruption, in unmasking abuses in the public expenditure, in proposing and enforcing reforms of various kinds. What a contrast does his conduct on this night afford! Under what sort of figure does he appear? \"Heu! Quantum mutates ab illo!\" The right hon. gent. (Mr. Canning) who now fills the office of treasurer of the navy, asserts that it is physically impossible to act up to the letter of the act, and has amused the house with an account of fractional sums of 8s. 6d. 14s. and 2s. and then turns short upon us, and asks how it is possible to pay all those trifling claims by drafts upon the bank? I do not say it is; but does he not keep money in the iron chest of his office to pay them, and are not the sub-accountants furnished with the means of liquidating them? But these abuses, it is said, can never occur again; Mr. Trotter, in his dying legacy to his successors, has pointed out the means of preventing it.315No;.it shall not be done for the future, says Mr. Trotter, and he bequeaths that to his successors which he never thought proper to enjoy himself. The act can never be violated again; I hope not; I hope the decision of the house this night, will render it impossible for the gent. who at present holds the situation of treasurer of the navy, or for any future treasurer, ever to violate it. But if we do not come to this decision, what security have we, that some future Melvilles and Trotters will not break through any new act we may pass, in the same way in which they have done the resolutions of this house in 1782, and the act of the 25th of his present majesty founded upon them. I hope and trust, sir, that a large and virtuous majority of this house will be found to put the seal and stamp of their reprobation upon such monstrous and unblushing delinquency. But, say some gentlemen, the depositions are not evidence. That I deny. If an impeachment were carried against my lord Melville and his associate, these depositions might be produced against them at the bar of the house of lords. Really, sir, I have a strong repugnance to enter into all the disgusting particulars of the conduct of this person with whom I had once some slight connection; God knows, it was a connection of hostility; but after what appears on the face of this report, I should be ashamed of myself if I belonged to the same class Of society with him. What is any honourable man to think of a person, who either refuses to answer a plain question, or who answers it equivocally and under reservation? Did you derive any advantage from the use of the public monies in the hands of your paymaster? 'To the best of my recollection I never did.'&#x2014;Now, the hon. gent.s' objection to this is, that the noble lord should have occasion at all to mention his recollection, on the subject. He should have been confident. There are some cases where a man may be allowed to speak as to his recollection, while in others, to mention it is to betray him. If a man were asked whether he was on a particular night in a particular room with John a Noakes, it might he very well to answer, that to the best of his recollection he was not, but if he, were asked whether John a Noakes did not charge him with an attempt to pick his pockets, and kick him out of the room&#x2014;what would be the inference if he were to answer that John did not, \"to the best of his recollection?\". With respect to the noble lord's offer to swear positively that he did not316profit from the misappropriation of the public money, it was remarkable that his offer was confined to the period in which Mr. Douglas, who was now dead, was paymaster of the navy, but did not at all extend to the paymastership of Mr. Trotter. What was the conclusion then to be drawn from this? Why, that he was ready to make oath as to the paymastership of Douglas, because he was dead, but did not think proper to swear as to Trotter, because he was alive.&#x2014;As to the letter which has been brought forward, and which, in my opinion, only aggravates and confirms his guilt, we never heard any thing of it, although his examination took place in Nov., until a few days previous to the day appointed for his trial. It is said that lord Melville never saw it till it was in print. Can any one believe it? Is it credible that the noble lord never had the curiosity to dispatch some confidential friend to make an extract of that part of the report which he had good reason to suppose must refer to him? When, indeed, he finds the effect of it on the public mind, when he finds that there is not a man, woman, or child, in every corner of the kingdom, in whose mouth the tenth report is not to be found; then, in order to do away the impression of it, he comes forward with his letter. But what can he now gain by this last shift of his? Nothing at all. But if he was suffered to avail himself of the delay he sought for, would not the country feel that the house of commons favoured public abuses, screened a great and criminal delinquent, and that our navy, the greatness and glory of the nation, was still possessed by that very man? Then in what respect would the government be held in the eyes of the people, and of foreign nations, should this man, in a state of accusation and suspicion, be suffered to hold his present high situation, when the bravest and most honourable commanders in the army and navy are always suspended from duty during an accusation of which the result might be an honourable acquittal. The impression on the public mind would now be, that lord Melville fled for protection to power and not innocence. I hope and trust that this dreadful and disgusting business, like all other evils, will produce some good: that, this day will be an &#x00E6;ra for commencing an examination into all public abuses, and be the former of such reforms as shall prevent great mischief in the country. I hope the right hon. gent. will himself undertake this great work; and that the commissioners of naval inquiry, to317whom the country is so much indebted, will continue their laudable and salutary pursuits, and bring every great delinquent to condign punishment.", "author_id": "/people/mr-charles-fox-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1805", "apr", "08"], "content": ".&#x2014;I do not rise, sir, at this late hour, to detain the house for any long time, but I cannot satisfy my mind without saying a few words in support of the original motion; for, notwithstanding I have listened with all the attention I am318master of, to the arguments of gentlemen who have opposed it, I must confess that it is impossible for me to leave the house this night without giving my vote in support of the resolutions moved by the hon. gent. It seems to me, that if I were willing to admit all which the advocates of lord Melville argue for, yet I am. equally bound to vote for the original motion. If the house were to step out of its way to adjust all the shades of criminality which belong to this case, then, indeed, it might be necessary to take some proceeding or other, similar to that which has been recommended to us by my right hon. friend, the chancellor of the exchequer. But here is plain, broad fact, which no subsequent elucidation can possibly explain away. Here is my lord Melville publicly declaring on his. Oath, that he has tolerated his dependant in a gross breach of an act of parliament, for the purposes of private emolument. I really cannot find language sufficiently strong to express my utter detestation of such conduct. In my mind, the friends of lord Melville have not at all affected the plain, simple state of the transaction. What advantage can we derive from going into a committee, for the purpose of contradicting an examination given on oath? I confess, sir, that I can not make up my mind to believe that lord Melville received any direct gain from the transactions alluded to. But, though I do not believe that lord Melville has been a participator in the profits, yet I think it by no means improbable that he may at times have drawn more freely upon Mr. Trotter than he ought to have done. I will not say that lord Melville has not received accommodation from these profits. The bare fact of his having borrowed 10 or 20,000l. at a time from one of his clerks, is a very suspicious circumstance. It is clear that Mr. Trotter is a man who acted on the great scale, and this fact was of itself calculated to produce strong suspicion. Let me ask any of my hon. friends around me, if there are no suspicious circumstances attending these transactions? If the house was once to suffer a minister to say that he had connived at the breach of a law by a person who had been his confidential servant for a number of years, and that superior was to pass un-censured because no personal corruption had been proved against him; if that was once to be admitted as a principle by which the house of commons was to be directed, it would open a door to every species of corruption, and there would be no security left319for. the faithful discharge of any public trust. Minsters may be desirous of waiting till the public feeling shall have subsided, and fancy that the whole business may blow over. But they are mistaken. They appear to me to have placed themselves in this situation. They might have prevented it. Had I been in their places I would not have risked my reputation by setting up such a justification as they have done for lord Melville.&#x2014;As to the argument that there has been no actual loss to the public by these transaction; when we reflect upon the consequences that might arise from the detention of money intended for the payment of so great a department as the navy of this country, when we reflect upon the lengths to which men may be induced to go if the mind is once accustomed to abuses, and when we consider the influence such conduct must inevitably have upon all the inferior departments, I do contend that the loss in a pecuniary view, may have been to an extent almost incalculable. It has been elegantly and beautifully said by a noble lord (Petty), that it would be fortunate indeed for this country had these abuses never been discovered, if the result was to be, that these Reports were to lay a dead letter on the table of this house, to prove and to proclaim, that although there might be found in this country persons honest and assiduous in conducting an inquiry into abuses, there was after and behind all this, a power able and willing to step in between the law and the offender against the law, and thereby establish at once the most fatal and the most shameful of all precedents, that of guilt known and acknowledged but not censured, of a breach of the law ascertained but not punished. But have we not sustained a loss which no money can-repay? Such is the opinion which I entertain of the consequences of the loss of honour, that I esteem it beyond any thing that can be set in balance against it. Would to God we could be restored to the state we were in before this happened! If abuses such as have been brought to light by the commissioners of naval inquiry are tolerated or in any degree countenanced by this house, melancholy indeed will be the result. As to the \"clamour\" that has been mentioned, it is not the cry of popular faction, but it is the universal sentiment of persons of every rank, of the rich as well as the poor, of the middling class of the community, who understand the constitution perfectly well. Greatly as the people of England disliked the conduct of Charles the First in levying ship money, it was not320so much the measure itself which such general discontent as the circumstance of the judges having given their opinion favour of it. Lord Clarendon concludes his reflections on this transaction with remarkable words: \"and here,\" says' he \"the damage and mischief cannot be expressed, that the crown and state sustained by the deserved reproach and infamy that attended the judges, by being made use of in this, and like acts of power; there being no possibility to preserve the dignity, reverence, and estimation of the laws themselves, but by the integrity and innocency of the judges.\" It is not only lord Melville, but we ourselves that are upon our trial, and a fearful trial it is. If we shrink from it we shall hereafter have reason to repent of our conduct. The house is now appealed to as the constitutional guardian of the rights of the people, and I should ill discharge my duty to the public, if I did not give my most cordial and sincere support to the present motion.", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-wilberforce-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

It did so happen that they identically corresponded with each other. This shewed that the reports which had gained ground without doors, as to a list of names having been industriously circulated, for the purpose of composing that important committee, were well founded. The house had already decided, that it was no breach of the orders or512customs of the house to circulate such lists; so that that he believed it would be deemed a breach of order in him to say that the treasury were guilty of so doing; and therefore he should endeavour to abstain from so expressing himself; though it was a fact of which he entertained not the smallest doubt. He would appeal to the right hon. gentlemen themselves whether or not they could venture to deny the fact to him. It was a conduct which, no doubt, appeared highly discreditable to them. Let the house recollect in what situation the right hon. gent. opposite (the chancellor of the exchequer) then stood. He (Mr. Pitt) had boldly come forward and taken upon himself a very great responsibility as to the country. Intimately connected with lord Melville, he had appealed to the house and the country as to the purity of his conduct. The right hon. gent. had, by his own account, his hands pure and his character unimpeached; and this assertion he (Mr. W.) was not disposed at that moment to call in question. He could not but observe, however, that a considerable deal of suspicion was created by the manner in which that right hon. gent. had prepared himself to go to trial. The persons who were to judge of his conduct were such as were appointed by himself. This surely was a circumstance not very creditable to that right hon. gent., and, in short, it appeared perfectly ludicrous to see a man stand up and say, \"here I am, ready to meet any accusation the house may think proper to bring forward against me, or call me in question from the beginning to the end of my political career. Who are to be my judges? Let them be declared in the face of day; let them be named by ballot.\" This conduct really appeared like a sham fight, in which that right hon. gent. had marched his troops out beforehand, and had seemed confident of being victorious. Let the house recollect the situation in which the business stood. Lord Melville was a principal object of the tenth report. He has been withdrawn from it, and the right hon. gent. has said, that there was nothing in any one page of that report which in the least impeached his own character. He begged leave to differ from that right hon. gent. and to state, before the appointment of that committee, that he stood under very suspicious circumstances, particularly with regard to the delicate and confidential transactions of government, and thequietusthat was granted by him to lord Melville, on the case of Mr. Jellicoe disclosed in513that report. An acknowledgement had been made by that right hon. gent. that he was actually in the knowledge of such transactions. It was natural to suppose, that the knowledge which he must have had of most of the transactions under the cognizance of lord Melville, would have implicated him in some degree, and required that he should be regularly and openly freed of any suspicion. Now, that lord Melville has been withdrawn, up starts the right hon. gent. and says, \"I am the person who is the object of the enquiry.\" It was particularly necessary to enquire, whether any representations were or were not made to the chancellor of the exchequer with regard to the withdrawing of the money from the bank. Such were the circumstances under which he (Mr. Pitt) had come down most magnanimously to move for a select committee for an enquiry. To whom were the house to confide the investigation of this important question? The right hon. gent. had named, amongst others, three persons who had made oath at the table of the house, that they thought it would be very much to the detriment of public business if they were obliged to attend on election committees. The first person he should mention was lord Castlereagh, who had positively sworn, that he conceived that it would impede his official business if he attended on a committee. The master of the rolls had sworn, that he could not attend on a similar committee, without creating inconvenience to the suitors in the court of chancery. Sir William Scott swore, that it would be attended with difficulty for him to attend, on account of his avocations in the court of admiralty. Now, there were these three persons who were thus disqualified from attending on this select committee, which disqualification was proved by their own depositions on oath, on account of their having occasion to attend to other public business. The oaths which he had mentioned were not taken on a peculiar case, such as the Middlesex committee, requiring their immediate and constant attendance, but it had been their regular practice hitherto. He apprehended that every member appointed upon such an important committee as the present, should be perfectly efficient, and able in every point of view devote his time and attention to such an important enquiry. Much suspicion was attached to the formation of this committee. He would appeal to the right514hon. gent. himself, whether he really wished, or thought it was for his advantage or that of the country, to have such a committee appointed? It was a committee of that right hon. gent.'s recommendation, if not nomination, (a cry of no! no!) He should wish to know if those gentlemen who were crying on this occasion, no, no, were willing to go to proof with him upon the subject. Perhaps he might think of calling some of them as witnesses to prove that the right hon. gent. had circulated these lists among his friends. He should put it again to the right hon. gent. standing, as he had done, in the place of lord Melville, and appearing magnanimous and gallant on the subject, whether it was a proper situation for the first minister of the country to stand in? and whether he himself should appoint the committee intended to investigate his own conduct? He had heard of persons playing at cards naming their own trumps, but the right hon. gent. carried this principle somewhat further, because he was taking upon himself the privilege of naming the whole of his own cards. He meant no personal disrespect to the individuals, but he had great objections to their political connections with the right hon. gent., which he thought, rendered them unfit persons. He thought on such a charge, the right hon, gent. should not have thought of making his own political friends his judges. That might not be the safest way; and the safest way seemed to be refused by the right hon. gent He, for himself, in such a situation, would not have desired to be tried by his coadjutors, in a case wherein his oldest and steadiest political ally had, as it had been expressed in this very enquiry, become a disgraced and punished political friend and associate. Especially he objected to the noble lord (Castlereagh), whose conduct, for many years, rendered him an unfit person. There was also another noble lord, from the same country, who held an office under the present administration(lord Dunlo). There was a right hon. gent. too in a place of high rank (Mr Foster), and the master of the rolls, and sir W. Scott, who could not attend without public detriment. He had rather, whatever respect he might have for them, see two country gentlemen in their places, though their talents and knowledge of business might be inferior. The noble lord (Castlereagh) was not merely a placeman, but a perpetual placeman. Nothing could move him. He was not to be shaken515by political storms and tempests, they only bound him more firmly to his post. That noble lord seemed invulnerable; he laughed at the convulsions of government and parties. Nothing short of an earthquake could shake him. He had been already celebrated for having two strings to his bow, and he kept his bow always strung. He seemed not to have two strings only to his bow, but as many as a certain person was noted for having to his knees. He was in power in the right hon. gent.'s last administration. He performed him some services at the union; after the union leaving Ireland, he came here, and was in place again. That administration went out on a specific public ground, and another came in on a directly opposite principle; but still the noble lord clung to office, and kept in place. That ministry was turned out by the help of his right hon. friend; but then was the noble lord again in power, and now he is in a new coalition. He did not question the purity of his principles, in all those evolutions by which he contrived to maintain his position and keep himself where he was: but would the country think him a proper person to investigate the conduct of his patron? He and his patron, no doubt, deserved each other's friendship, for their mutual services. He would give his lordship credit for manly policy, and gratitude to the right hon. gent.; but though this might be very gratifying in private life, it rather disqualified him for the situation to be allotted him. For what was the committee to examine into? Delicate and secret transactions! The noble lord had been engaged in similar transactions in Ireland already, and his palate may have become vitiated in these matters, and the public and he entertain very different ideas on the uses and abuses of public money. He might refer to some late matters. The noble lord had been charged by the right hon. gent. now sitting beside him (Mr. Foster) with a scandalous misuse of money, in payments to persons in Ireland, to carry the union, and had sat mute. He felt convinced that the right hon. gent. opposite could not, from his usual accuracy, have made the charge, could he not have proved it. It was repeated last night. He would refer the noble lord to his right hon. friend. If he denied it, what if he examined Mr. Foster at the bar? What might not turn out in these \"delicate transactions\" of lord Melville? Was the noble lord a person fit for that committee? Let the enquiry be516ever so severe and honest, the public would not be satisfied with such a committee, after such a charge which he (Mr. W.) offered to prove. He reckoned, therefore, such a motion not extraordinary, after what had happened, though not precedented.&#x2014;The hon. member then alluded to his own name, and observed, that he would gladly withdraw from such a committee; but if it appeared the general wish for him to remain on it, he should certainly take care to attend to it. Let him, however, be struck off, if any person thought his conduct in this business rancorous; if they considered him a persecutor instead of a prosecutor; or if they could see the folly he was accused of, respecting the alleged changes in the order of his motion. He liked his conduct the better for the censures he received from some persons.&#x2014;After dwelling with great force on the modes attempted to screen lord Melville, and the limitations of the power of the committee, he maintained, that with the first majority of one, and the minorities since, the people of England, Scotland, and Ireland, went hand in hand, and applauded their justice and spirit. Was all talent gone? Could no independent gentlemen be found to make up a committee for such a purpose as this? He would put it to the gent. of the opposite side, whether they would make this committee a screen; or a stalking-horse? Would they have the public consider it as a cloak to cover lord Melville? He thought he could name a gentleman, even in the place of the Master of the Rolls, though less able, yet whom the country would like better; and this would apply more largely to the other objectionable persons. He could find persons as competent, and possessing more of the faith of the public. Instead of the name of the noble lord, he would propose a gentleman whom he had loved and respected from youth, but whom he had almost constantly opposed in politics, both in and out of that house; with whom he must have sometimes had the heats and even the bitterness of contest&#x2014;a bitterness of zeal and not of acrimony; one who had given the right hon. gent. an independent support for years. This gentleman he had even within these few months opposed actively in his election to serve in that house, and he did not repent of it: he might do so again. He meant Mr. Baker, of Hertford; a gentleman of talents, and anxiously laborious in every thing relative to public advantage,517and commanding every respect from all who knew him. He should therefore conclude by moving, \"that the name of lord Castlereagh be struck out, and that of Mr. Baker substituted in its room.\"", "author_id": "/people/mr-samuel-whitbread-2", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

{"date": ["1805", "apr", "30"], "content": "said, there was a warmth intruded into the discussion, which did not belong to it. The real question was, which side of the house most conduced to support the character of the house, and to fulfil the just expectations of the public? In some degree the right hon. gent. seemed to have a correct notion of the subject, but in order to justify himself, he presumed to call the opinion of the nation a party cry. Were the resolutions of the City of London a party cry? Were the meetings all over the kingdom a party cry? Was the vote of the house of commons, supported by the independent spirit of its speaker, a party cry? It ought to be known, that the time was at hand, when it was necessary to encourage the friends of the state, by the loud voice of the people. The gent. on his side of the house did not challenge the individuals proposed for the committee without cause. They distinctly said, no one holding a place under the crown, is a proper person to examine the conduct of the first lord of the treasury. They said, a person like the noble lord, who had since the union acted with the minister, went out with him, came again into office with him, and remained to open a back door for the right hon. gent.'s admission, is not a fit man to be employed on such an occasion. Perhaps, their&#x0153; amantium,of which gentlemen had heard within these few hours, rendered him,522if possible, yet more objectionable. Could it then be said (he would repeat the question) that no cause was shewn for the challenge? It was extremely suspicious, that the first person proposed by his hon. friend (Mr. Whitbread), being a partizan of the ministers, should be resisted, and the proposition for the ballot immediately succeed. The right hon. gent. said, \"shall I be stripped of my friends? Is no person in office, no one connected with me to appear in the committee?\" It was not required that no colleague in place should be on the committee, but it was demanded, that the members should not be pestered with treasury lists. Could the right hon. gent. not trust to the league of private affection? And if his confidence were deficient there, could he not repose in the expectation, that, for the many favours received, and the many more in reversion, his connections would not be unmindful of his security? It was not fair to say, the exclusion, on some important occasions, of persons in place, was unknown to our law; this was the case under the circumstance of appointing committees on delinquency in the East Indies. Who brought in the bill by which this was enacted? Lord Melville. This was the public reformer who was so lately libelled by the house of commons; this was the man who was chairman of the committee, and who prosecuted the unfortunate delinquents with extraordinary severity. But this was not an Indian delinquent, it was the person advanced to the head of the king's government. How much more expedient then was it, that this great officer of state, if guilty, should not be protected by the companions in his crimes? The right hon. gentleman forgot himself. He (Mr. Sheridan) told him he was himself upon his trial, but he replied, that there was no charge, no report against him. The right hon. gent. prescribed three things, which the committee were to try, and it was extremely unlucky that in all three he himself was implicated. The first was, if he had authentic information of the purpose for which the money was drawn out (that was, if the first lord of the treasury had such intelligence of the proceeding of lord Melville and Mr. Trotter). The second was, if the money was withdrawn for the purposes for which it was voted, and applied to the delicate services which had been adverted to. It was curious to see a person put on the523committee, of whom it was said he had corrupted the Irish parliament. If he would commit such practices with regard to one legislature, his inclination at least would not be deficient to do the same to another. On this charge of the misapplication of the money, the right hon. gent. was to be tried, and if it should be found that the first lord of the treasury authorised such conduct, it would be no wonder if the subalterns in office took advantage of it to effect their own purposes. The third regarded the discharge given to lord Melville, on account of the defalcation of Mr. Jellicoe. Was it not then most obvious, that the right hon. gent.'s purity was the question to be determined in all these? Then his hon. friend very naturally enquired what would a man of honour do if placed in such an unhappy predicament? The right hon. gent., when the subject was started, made no objection to the committee. He felt himself so closely touched, so sore when his conduct was doubted, that he would have the matter fully examined, and, to use his own words, he would have it sifted to the bottom. Then said his hon. friend truly, a man of honour, in such a disposition, would have no concern with, and if possible, no knowledge of the parties by whom the enquiries were to be prosecuted. But what was the course of the right hon. gent.? He said, \"I will prescribe the line of your march. I will appoint the commanders in the field.\" He drew up the indictment by which he was to be arraigned, and then nominated the jury before whom he was to be tried.

He reprobated the terms that had been employed by some hon. gent. in speaking of the committee, and thought his hon. friend (Mr. Lascelles) perfectly justifiable in resenting the general language of opprobrium that had been applied to it.&#x2014;They had been told by an hon. member that he was far from meaning to attach any disrespect to his hon. friend, or to impute any disgrace to individuals of the committee. What! said the right hon. gent., is it then no disgrace to belong to a packed jury, such as they attempted to represent this committee? He was glad, however, his hon. friend had taken an opportunity of having such broad imputations contradicted.

The right hon. gent. had not, it seemed, entirely forgotten the early habits of his life, and had therefore talked in the language of that profession, to which he was bred, \"of a challenge for cause.\" He begged, however, as a professional man also, to remind the right hon. gent., that there were in our law two sorts of challenges, and that the other of them was \"a challenge of the array,\" by which last the law provides that no public officer shall chose his own jury, and he was astonished the right hon. gent. should attempt to take advantage of being tried by a tribunal of his own nomination.

The official con-527nexion which he (Mr. W.) had had with lord Melville, the social intercourse thence arising, and the impression made on his mind by the many amiable and estimable qualities, which the noble lord was known to possess, were all circumstances, which tended to disqualify him for the duty meant to be imposed on him. It was a duty which he did not wish to undertake. As to the nature of the committee, it ought in his judgment to be composed, not merely of impartial, unprejudiced persons, persons who would receive and report truth when submitted to them, but of those who would be disposed to go in pursuit of it, and would be zealous and active in their researches. The committee was not meant for judicial decision, but to collect and bring forth the grounds for a charge, which should be submitted, afterwards, to the consideration of the house. The character of the committee was rather accusatory than judicial. Was it not then singular, that the very person accused, should himself nominate the committee that was to examine the grounds of the accusation? When a friend was thus appointed to pursue such examination, he must be rather a sturdy moralist, who could use the necessary diligence in order to seek out facts likely to lead to conviction. The task was more ungrateful than ought to be imposed on any one, and the confidence was too much for the house to repose.&#x2014;It was a trial which he was not willing to encounter. The only argument that could be used was, that it was not so much lord M. as the rt. hon. gent. (Mr. Pitt) that was the object of charge, as the powers of the committee were now limited. But this was only to change the person, leaving the case the same. He once acted with the right hon. gent., although he now disagreed with him; and, indeed, to speak correctly, even when he did act with him he could not be said properly to agree with him. The agreement was rather comparative than absolute&#x2014;rather with reference to the sentiments of those than opposed to the right hon. gent., and with from he (Mr. W.) now concurred, than from a complete coincidence in the views entertained by the right hon. gent. Still his connection with the right hon. gent. had been such that he did not wish to be a member of a committee appointed to arraign his conduct. In considering the powers with528which this committee was vested, combined with the persons of which it was composed, he really did not think it was calculated to give satisfaction to the country. And however little he might be disposed, or might wish that others at different times had been disposed, to enforce a devoted reverence for public opinion on great questions of general policy, upon which, what was called the public was generally incompetent to judge; yet upon such an occasion as this, the case was directly the reverse. Here public opinion was not only entitled to peculiar attention, but was itself a great part of the question. The weightiest part of the charge against the noble lord (lord M.) was the shock he had given to public opinion; and the first duty imposed upon the house, was to take such measures, consistent with justice, as might be likely to restore it. Where the suspicions of the public were reasonable, whether they should ultimately turn out to be well or ill founded, they had a claim to consideration and satisfaction. As Dr. Johnson said of the partisans of Ossian, 'to revenge reasonable incredulity by refusing evidence, was a degree of insolence to which the world had not been accustomed!' It was the duty and interest of the house to preserve itself from suspicion in any part of its proceedings upon this delicate question. The wife of Caesar should not only be pure but unsuspected. If the committee were to be constructed according to present appearances, his conviction really was, that although the condemnation of the party accused by such a committee might have weight, their acquittal would have no weight at all&#x2014;[a cry of hear! hear!] He conjured the house to take such a course as should satisfy the public; and though this was a phrase which, used too generally, would rather befit the proprietor of a theatre or a tea garden than a great and grave assembly; yet it was a fit address to the house on this occasion. The public was the party to be satisfied, for it was the property of the public that had been misapplied, and what was still more to the purpose, it was the confidence of the public, that had been shaken.&#x2014;If obliged by the vote of the house to become a member of this committee, formed as it had been, by ballot, and limited, as it was, in the objects of its enquiry, he desired to be understood as engaging in it contrary to his inclination, and as entering his protest against the proceeding.", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-windham-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

The noble lord had stated that his hon. friend had no respect for parliament but when it acceded to his wishes. Such a declaration he considered unparliamentary. The noble lord had also thought proper to refer to the past conduct of his hon. friend. To such a reference he should gladly submit the point at issue; he was not afraid of the discussion which would arise out of that enquiry; he should even provoke it with great pleasure. His hon. friend did what he himself was obliged to do at the same time time; he ceased to attend in his place in parliament: this was what the noble lord called desertion and abandonment of public duty. His hon. friend abstained from attending when he knew that his presence could be attended with no success; he did not attend when he had experience of the inutility of combating for the public good, and promoting the interest of the country. But when his hon. friend and himself had given up attendance in the house, they did not leave the right hon. gent. (Mr. Pitt) under any great embarrassment, they left him in possession of the support, almost the unqualified support, of the house of commons, and without opposition; he had the resources of the country at his command, without check or restraint. How then could the noble lord state that his hon. friend caused any embarrassment by his non-attendance, when that very circumstance afforded the right hon. gent. every facility to carry on his favourite plans of every kind without being questioned as to their fitness or expediency? The noble lord had misrepresented his hon. friend, as calling this a packed committee. He might have said, the committee was solicited by the right hon. gent. and he would ask him, whether it Was consistent with a high sense of dignity, and very honourable to his feelings? When the question before the committee was that of abuse, and the conduct of the right hon. gent. the subject of enquiry, was it honourable or delicate in him to endeavour to recommend the appointment of persons firm in his interest, and connected with him in the government? The noble lord next complained of the manner of his hon. friend's bringing forward his motion. The argument he wished to apply in this case, was respecting the qualification of the noble lord. It was532not merely a question regarding the concealment of facts in the committee, but there were other duties that regarded the investigation of abuses. It was a proper consideration, whether we should not avoid the appointment of persons, who had been themselves active in the matters complained of. He wished to ask, upon aprima facieview of the question, whether it was not a strong objection to the appointment of the noble lord, that he was connected with the person who formed the subject matter of complaint, that it might turn out, that he was himself a party concerned. The first charge against, the right hon. gent. was his knowledge of, and connivance at the withdrawings of money from the Bank. The second was, whether it had been withdrawn for the purposes for which it was voted, and applied, as it was stated, to delicate services; and the third charge regarded the acquittal of Mr. Jellicoe. He would insist, that the knowledge which the noble lord was likely to have of these transactions, and his connection with administration, were substantial grounds for his disqualification. The noble lord was himself a minister, and connected with the noble lord who had been adjudged a delinquent, and might himself be implicated. The noble lord had been again pronouncing his panegyrics upon the Irish parliament, and had said, that there never was a more meritorious sacrifice to public duty and the welfare of the country, than that which produced the union. That sacrifice, however, was obtained by the purchase of private boroughs with the public money. His lordship had been charged with this: but he did not attempt a word in his own vindication. As the noble lord denied that any charge had been preferred against him by the right hon. gent. on the treasury bench near him (Mr. Foster); let him, therefore, ask that right hon. gent. Whether the charge could be supported, he did not mean to say, but that it had been made was most certain and undeniable. The noble lord heard the charge at the time it was made by the right hon. gent. he heard his hon. friend (Mr. Whitbread) also repeat it. He was charged with giving money for the purchase of votes. That charge stood against the noble lord, let him answer it: would he screen himself, like persons who refused to acknowledge their delinquency, under the 5th clause? He should, however, only say for the present, that the charge had been made, and no answer whatever had been given. With respect to feelings, were533he to change situations with the noble lord, and be accused and shrink from the charge, without giving an unequivocal denial, he should feel disgraced, and stand in the situation of a delinquent. Abuse of office was the subject of the present investigation. Public corruption was the subject of this inquiry; he, therefore, would ask whether the noble lord was a proper person to be upon that committee? but when the question was agitated, the gentlemen on the other side found it necessary to shelter themselves under the proceedings of the house, and say that he and his friends were endeavouring to vilify the character of the house, by objecting to certain names in the list for the committee. If those names were liable to objections, there was no other way of shewing that but by the mode his hon. friend had taken, and for which he deserved the greatest thanks. With respect to the mode of ballot, the theory which was used in the present case was not applicable in any other. When the abuses of government were the matters of complaint; at a time when the people, loaded with taxes, were looking with the greatest anxiety to that house for redress, it was their duty to adopt the most efficient method of bringing delinquency to light, and doing that justice which was expected at their hands. But his chief objection was to the quarter from whence those lists had been circulated; a quarter where the power was great, and influence might be practised. The right hon. gent. had said, that if lists were circulated, they were not obligatory; he would ask the right hon. gent. if there was not great danger of creating an improper influence? If in a court of justice, the accused party was to circulate lists among the jury who who were to try him, would not the right hon. and learned gent. the attorney general, fall immediately upon them, and expose the criminality of their conduct? The defence that would not be accepted in a court of justice, ought not to be received in a house of commons.", "author_id": "/people/mr-charles-grey-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

He believed lists might have been circulated from the treasury; but to counterbalance this, had not opposition their lists also? If no lists should be sent out, government, or opposition, or any other lot of men, might decide upon any question where ballot should be employed; and the noble lord who was now objected to might have his ten friends, and be borne off by that number of persons politically attached to him, or ruined by his adversaries. He would acknowledge he had received one of those lists, from whom he knew not; and he exercised his discretion upon it to the same extent that he presumed every member who received one did; he made such alterations in it, and those with respect to more names than one, as he conceived indispensible towards obtaining an impartial, active, and enlightened committee. He could perceive that on the ballot but few of the opposition members put in their lists, and he thought he could perceive the motives which influenced them to decline the exercise of that privilege; and that was, because they had determined at the time to bring forward this motion. He was one of those who had voted with the hon. gent.

The effect of such a measure must obviously be highly detrimental to trade in general. The farmer could not, on account of the scarcity of specie, sell a small quantity of corn there, to the amount of 20s. or 30s. unless he could, which was very rarely the case, give change for a 3-guinea note, and the same difficulty was felt in every other branch of dealing. This was not felt in England, or Scotland, where the private bankers can get small notes from the Bank of England; but the national Bank of Ireland was restrained, so as not to extend its issues. He saw no reason for this distinction in the case of Irish private banks, as they must always have in their possession national notes, in proportion to their own issues, and were therefore perfectly secure. He would leave it to any gent., conversant with business, to reflect on the extreme inconveniencies that must ensue ever here, if, while the restriction on the bank continues, there381should be no smaller than 3 guinea notes in circulation. In Ireland, the measure had a most desireable tendency, as the tradesman there had seldom any other way of getting his note exchanged, but of repairing to the public house, and spending a great part of the money.

The right hon. gent. opposite to him seemed also sensible of the general spirit which had been awakened through the country. He had that night, prematurely in one sense, and tardily in another, given notice of a motion which he unquestionably meant in some shape to meet the wishes of the people. In doing so, however, was not the right hon. gent. taking the business out of the hands of other hon. gentlemen, who had already given notice of similar intentions? That was not a novel practice, now for the first time adopted by the right hon. gent. It happened some years ago to him (Mr. Whitbread), on which occasion the right hon. gent. took a business out of his hands, but never did any thing under it. The right hon. gent. had indeed given notice of a much more extensive motion than had yet been proposed; but whether he had done so in consequence of hearing that such an intention had been declared in another quarter, and wished to take it out of their hands for the purpose of doing it away, he should not at present pretend to judge. If a new committee was appointed, he hoped it would be characterised by equal fidelity with that which had distinguished the commissioners for naval enquiry. The right hon. gent. had expressed a doubt if there existed any lavish or improper expenditure in the military department. On that subject he (Mr. Whitbread) entertained no doubts. He was convinced that in the military department as gross a system of peculation and plunder existed as had already in part been discovered in the naval expenditure. An hon. gent., a friend of the noble lord, had, in vindicating him from the present charge, asserted that he possessed opportunities in another department of making an immense and rapid fortune, without any chance of detection. That hon. gent. was well acquainted with the truth of what he stated: and was it to be supposed after what we had seen, that such opportunities did exist, and that too, without the possibility of detection, and that no advantage was taken of them. The thing was hardly to be looked for. The first motion which he should now submit to the consideration of the house, was for a401select committee, for taking into farther consideration the tenth report of the commissioners of naval enquiry. There were still some dark parts in that report, on which he wished that farther enquiry should take place. It was not his intention to enter at any length into what passed on the last debate on the subject, farther than to say, that he thought the right hon. gent. opposite had not paid that proper respect to that house, and to the commissioners acting under their authority, which might have been expected, in not dismissing a person who had refused to answer the questions put to him, when called on under an act of parliament to give evidence. Would it be maintained that every witness was to be entitled to decline answering any question which might be put to him, on the pretence that it might criminate himself; and that the judge was not entitled to ask, in what respect, and to ascertain whether the allegation was real or feigned? The right hon. gent. himself actually condemned Wilson, and condemned his own conduct by the apology he now made for both. He now confesses that the clause of the act of parliament, does not apply to Wilson. According to his own account, Wilson tells him, and he now tells the house, that Wilson was the instrument and tool of Trotter. Would his being so involve him in legal, or even moral guilt, so as to excuse him from answering questions? The pretence was ridiculous, it was to screen his principal, not himself; for, as being merely tool, any answer he might have made, might have gone to exculpate, but could not criminate himself. Equally well might the printer of the stamp on which the order was written, have refused answering any question which might have been put to him, lest he should criminate himself. Another hon. gent. (Mr. Ward) had been much offended at an expression which had fallen from the hon. president of the board of Enquiry&#x2014;that he took blame to himself for not having committed Wilson to prison. He hoped that hon. gent. would attend on the night when the vote of thanks was to be moved to the commissioners of Naval Enquiry, and would then state what he had alleged that night, that in consequence of the declaration, the hon. president ought to be dismissed from his situation. He (Mr. Whitbread) declared, that had he been in the place of the hon. bart. he would have committed not only Wilson, but Sprott402also; and so, he hoped, would every commissioner of Enquiry feel himself inclined to act. It was not his wish to trespass on the time of the house, and he should, therefore, conclude by moving his first motion, \"That a select committee be appointed to make further enquiry into the matters contained in the report of the commissioners, and to report the same, with their opinions and observations thereon, to the house.\"", "author_id": "/people/mr-samuel-whitbread-2", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

There was another point which he thought would not go with propriety to the committee; but would be better discussed in that house, and that was not a crimination, but an admonition to the right hon. gent. (Mr. Canning) on his continuing Mr. Wilson in office. This naturally led him to remark, that it was not by the house going into an enquiry on the tenth report alone; on the abuses in the military department, or in all the departments, that they could perform their duty. They could do their duty only by going into those enquiries seriously, and with an intent to persevere. If they were to go into enquiries, let them shew their sincerity by the persons whom they chose of the committee. Persons like the commission-405ers of naval enquiry, of fidelity, ability, and above all, courage; who had not shrunk from their duty, even when it called on them to expose one of the most powerful men in this country.&#x2014;If they were for enquiry, let them endeavour, if possible, to get men equal to these commissioners.

He had no doubt the very persons who had expressed an opinion against the commissioners of Naval Enquiry would still be of opinion that they ought to be continued; yet this they would do not willingly. He did not blame the right hon. gent. (Mr. Pitt) for being the friend of lord Melville, yet he could not but think it unfortunate, that he should be the person to move for a committee on the other subjects of enquiry. If the committee had been to be moved for by some gentleman near him&#x2014;by any person (he spoke in an abstract sense) not on the treasury bench, he thought it would have been better, more creditable, and more effectual. When a minister, under whose administration all the mismanagement and peculation have taken place, has the mortification to find that the delinquent is not a person remote, but his own nearest and dearest colleague, he cannot be the most proper person to move a committee to take cognizance of the malversations. He trusted the house would take care to have proper persons appointed in the committee. If that right hon. gent. had had the appointing of the five commissioners of naval enquiry, would they have the tenth report? He hoped the gentlemen that should be appointed would discharge their duty. It was natural that in appointing them, the favourable opinion of the gentleman who names them of those who concurred with him in opinion, would lead him to appoint only such. They could not prevent such partiality, but they could promote the effect of the enquiry, by encouraging those who assisted, and reprobating those who thwarted or obstructed it,&#x2014;He did not think that the enquiry should be restricted by the words of the amendment, but he submitted to his hon. friend, whether the motion for the prosecution might not be better postponed till after the committee shall have reported, and ascertained by their enquiry what persons have been connected with the delinquents. The right hon. the406Chancellor of the Exchequer had this day more openly than on any other occasion avowed his disapprobation of the conduct of the noble viscount, bnt he had also declared, that he did not look upon it as his duty to advise his majesty to any other step, unless the house, by a fresh decision, should make it necessary for him. This had raised his suspicion, and he thought it his duty to put the house on its guard. It had been, at different periods, customary to institute enquiries in that house; which were never afterwards thought of. He alluded to the commitee that was appointed to enquire into the state of the finances, just after the first stoppage of the bank to pay in cash, which had never proceeded to any researches, though it was now well known what they might have discovered.

But, however willing he was to see any measure of this kind promoted, he could not see, without alarm, any disposition on the part of that right hon. gent. to appoint such commissioners. He wished the motion to407have originated in some other quarter, and it was not his fault if that notice had not been long ago given for that purpose, and which he now thought there was reason to regret. Indeed, this notice, he understood, was to have been given to-day, had it not been thus anticipated. The right hon. gent. might have as a reason, perhaps, for his acceding to the appointment of a select committee, according to the motion of his hon. friend, that he himself (Mr. Pitt) had been implicated in the charges of the tenth report, and was anxious, therefore, that every fair enquiry should be made.

The conduct of the right hon gent. himself, it was evident, would be involved in that enquiry, whether it regarded the various departments of the army, or the management of the exchequer. It was, therefore, a very grave question with him, how far it was admissible for any appointment of that nature to originate in that quarter. The right hon. gent. might think it a popular measure. It was making the most, perhaps, of a case of necessity, and taking the merit of proposing what he could not prevent, but must certainly, at best, be considered as a very forward step.", "author_id": "/people/mr-richard-sheridan-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

His right hon. friend had no design of delaying the enquiry; he was only of opinion that, if it was the intention of the hon. gent. to move for a legal prosecution, it would be proper to give that motion precedence of the other. The propriety of this arrangement was obvious. For those persons who were to be subjected to legal enquiry, were not to be expected to give any answer before the committee, that might tend to criminate them before a court of justice. Such an arrangement, therefore, would defeat the very end of408any legal proceeding, and cramp at the same time the enquiries of the committee, as those persons were the only evidence from whom they were to derive their information. In regard to the amendment proposed by his right hon. friend, he entirely concurred in thinking that the committee ought to be confined to their proper object, and not to interfere in such points as should be judged necessary to be referred to a court of justice. If, therefore, the motion for a legal enquiry were first fixed, and the object or objects of that legal investigation determined, the committee would have the advantage of knowing to what objects they were to confine their exertions, and would be relieved from that part of the subject which would come under the cognizance of a court of justice.

When we talk of the propriety of such motions, I hope we shall not lose sight of the particular circumstances and the particular time under which they are produced. It is the duty of this house at all times to be jealous of its honour, but this is a period when this jealousy ought to be the most active. A late decision of this house has diffused universal gratitude throughout the country, and it is our duty to see that this decision shall not be wantonly attacked and insulted. It is the more necessary, sir, for us to see that our resolution is properly respected, when we find men in high official situations endeavouring to act as the protectors of those condemned of the grossest malversations. When we see evident signs of reluctance to384have delinquents brought to punishment, is it not our province to teach those who libel our proceedings, that they shall not do so with impunity? We have voted certain resolutions on which his majesty's servants have not hitherto thought it their duty to take the least proceedings.&#x2014;The right hon. gent. opposite, the treasurer of the navy, even continues in office, a man whom the commissioners of naval enquiry have declared unworthy of acting in any pecuniary situation, since, he refused to answer questions essentially connected with the object of their investigations.

I therefore entirely coincide in the motion of my honourable friend who introduced this business, while it is impossible to disagree with the right hon. gent. opposite, that in all cases of a similar kind, we ought to proceed with the greatest fairness and impartiality.

{"date": ["1805", "apr", "25"], "content": "&#x2014;The allusions which the hon. gent. has made to my conduct, renders it necessary to say a few words in reply. The hon. gent., sir, has represented it to be an aggravation of this libel, that Mr. Wilson has been continued in my office after the opinion of this house had been formally declared. [A general cry of No, No, from the opposite side of the house.] With all due deference to the hon. gent.'s logic, I think it is, in this instance, altogether erroneous. It is, indeed, a most extraordinary position, that, because other persons had been guilty of improper acts, the author of the libel, who knows nothing of the matter, is to have a severer punishment. I wish, sir, the honourable gentleman had considered the matter a little better, and then, I am confident, he could not easily reconcile such ideas, either with logic or humanity. With regard to this Mr. Wilson, it is necessary for me to declare that I entertain for him no individual385concern or regard. In retaining him in the situation which he now holds, I looked only to the equity of the business. I could not reconcile it to my ideas of justice to dismiss one against whom no decision of this house had taken place; against whom no proof of criminality, so far as the use of the public money is concerned, has been even attempted to be established. He indeed refused to answer certain questions from the commissioners of naval enquiry, but on what grounds did his refusal rest? It was expressly under the idea that his answers would subject him to certain pains and penalties; not that he participated of any money improperly applied, but that he acted as the deputy of a person whom a vote of the house had declared guilty of a misapplication of the public money. In all these transactions Wilson was merely the deputy, merely the instrument to carry forward the designs of another. True it is, he filled up drafts in the absence of his principal, but it was impossible for him, while he continued in the office, to refuse such an employment. He might indeed have resigned, but nothing short of this could have superseded the necessity of the conduct to which so much blame is now attached. Having then officiated as a deputy, Wilson very naturally refused to answer questions to which he knew that punishment might be applicable, and to which, under a clause of an express act, he was entitled to refuse any reply. Surely, sir, it will not be contended by the gentlemen on the other side, that the clause, under which Wilson refused to answer the commissioners, was intended to be an absolute nullity. It was certainly intended for some purpose, or it never have been adopted. It was designed for the protection of those who, though conscious of no moral delinquency, might, under particular circumstances, have been guilty of a legal crime. Such was exactly the situation in which Wilson stood in the whole of this business. Looking to the transaction a moral view, looking to him as not deriving the slightest advantage from misapplication of the public money, he had no more to do with it than the pen which he used, than the very ink which he used for those drafts by which the transfer was effected. Let me remind the house too, that the clause was not introduced into the bill on light authority. I contended for it strenuously here, but my exertions were not crowned386with success. In the other house of parliament, however, it was introduced on the suggestion of the lord chancellor, and when I have said this, I have surely said enough to shew that the clause was not meant to be an idle, unmeaning provision; but an active, positive regulation, on which every individual appearing before the commissioners had a fair right to act. Wilson did take advantage of the clause, and in so doing, only did what almost any man would have done under such circumstances. Though only himself an instrument, he was sensible that his answers might bring him into an unpleasant situation, which therefore he prudently avoided. In such conduct there was no criminality, since, while the individual exercised a right which the law allowed him, the public sustained no loss. This, sir, is the view which the best consideration of the subject has suggested, and, acting on these principles, I have not thought it my duty to dismiss Mr. Wilson from the situation which he holds in my office. This house has hitherto decided nothing on the case of Wilson, and, therefore, I have not felt it my duty to dismiss him from his present employment. When the house does express such a determination, it will undoubtedly be my duty to bow to it with all suitable respect; but, till that opinion is expressed, I shall continue to follow that line of conduct which appears to me alike consistent with justice and humanity. I am sensible, that in following this course, I subject myself to a great deal of odium and abuse. My conduct is ascribed to the most dishonourable motives; my refusal to dismiss Wilson is branded with the opprobrious epithet of protection of convicted guilt. Seeing the matter, however, as I now see it, I shall endure all this odium and reproach. When this house shall declare their opinion fairly, it will be my duty to submit to it; till that period arrives, Wilson shall not, in the absence of any proof of his guilt, be dismissed from his situation. I shall never, either by my voice or by my conduct, patronize the tyrannical, despotic principle of punishment previous to conviction.

In alluding to the case of Wilson, he had meant clearly to explain to the house his opinion, that when men in high offices in the state, acted as the protectors of those against whom strong accusations existed, it became a matter of necessity that every attack on the character of the house, should be carefully looked to and signally punished.

Another circumstance also had been much insisted upon to the prejudice of the late paymaster, viz. the advice he gave Mr. Tierney on quitting his office, which that gentleman had followed, and which had been considered as resulting less from a desire to be serviceable to the public than to bar the advantages (as the commissioners had reported) of his successor. To this fact the hon. baronet appealed to Mr. Tierney himself, who did not appear, as far as he had understood him, to have considered it in that view, but merely as growing out of a conversation on the means to avoid accidental loss on the transit of money from the bank to the office. The hon. baronet avowed a remote family connexion with the late paymaster, but he trusted that he might be allowed to indulge his feelings to a certain extent in consequence of that affinity, without being suspected for a moment to entertain a wish to check the course of public justice, as applying to Mr. Trotter or to any other person who stood under the censure of that house. He trusted also that whatever proceedings might be adopted by the house, their justice would be tempered with mercy. He then adverted to the prevalent prejudices in the public mind with respect to Mr. Trotter's great accumulations, but he could venture to assure the house that the \"immense palace\" so often adverted to was nearly as visionary as the \"palace of Aladdin;\" being a house of very moderate extent or accommodation, and upon which had been expended less than 8000l.; and further that the total of Mr. Trotter's income derived from all his real and personal property, without any reser-417vation or subterfuge, did not exceed 1200l. a year. To these facts he could pledge himself; they had been ascertained to the satisfaction of a great number of persons, and he was assured that in whatever future proceedings the house might institute to obtain the full disclosure of Mr. Trotter's affairs, they would appear to the conviction of the house and the public.", "author_id": "/people/sir-john-hippisley", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

The object of the statute was to keep the public money, under the orders of the treasurer of the navy, in the bank, and for this purpose it was enacted, that no draft should be issued but for some special navy service. It would probably be found, that a special service was stated when no such service existed. The act directed, that the property in the bank should vest in the sucessor to the office; but when the money was transferred to Messrs. Coutts and Co. this purpose of the legislature was disappointed. Supposing the event of the death of Mr. Trotter had taken place, and the million of money had been with Messrs. Coutts and Co. on the change in the treasurer of the navy: until administration was taken out, the property could not be removed, and who would have administered to the effects of Mr. Trotter? It was true that he (Mr. Tierney) had held some conversation with Mr. Trotter, and the latter gentleman communicated, as an important secret, that he had devised the means by which all hazard by the loss of drafts on the bank by messengers would be avoided, and that was, by what be called awrite off.He well remembered, on the occasion of this grand disclosure, the word legacy was used: a person who was present in the office observed, \"Here is a legacy of Mr. Trotter's, he is determined we should not obtain the same emoluments he has enjoyed.\" Having said thus much on official matters, in answer to the hon. gentleman who spoke last, he would now say a few words to the question before the house.

The house had determined there had been a violation of law; and farther, that advantages had been derived, which ought not to have been conceded. With re-418spect to the last, he could not avoid considering that the restitution of public money would be best obtained by a legal process; but on such a subject he must speak with diffidence, as the law officers attending in that house had not thought fit to hazard any opinion. He was anxious to learn, if they also judged this to be the best mode of proceeding, what would they undertake? would they compel Mr. Trotter to account for the misapplication of the public money? Could they ascertain the quantum of the deficit? He feared the law officers would have no means of ascertaining how far lord Melville participated in the profits; he supposed the utmost of which they could acquire information, would be the aggregate of such profits.

Perhaps the right hon. gent. himself might make that motion, but he should not assume it to be already made and decided. He could not but commend the delicacy of the learned gentleman (the attorney general). The learned gentleman cautiously abstained from deciding whether a legal proceeding should be instituted or not. At least, he had given no reason to expect that any good could be expected to result from it; and all the other great law officers were equally silent upon that point. But what says the learned gentleman, \"whatever may be the mode of proceeding may they not demur, and refuse to answer? and if they demur, where is the compulsion?' Before a committee, they could demur only under the protection of the fifth clause of the act. Still he would have lord Melville and Mr. Trotter brought before the committee. Who could pronounce what might be in the contemplation of the committee to adopt? and if no suggestion had been thrown out of a prosecution by the attorney general, why should it be supposed that the committee would be found to institute one? The learned gent. gives the preference to a court of justice; and for what reason? No doubt, only because it is proposed to limit and cripple the powers of the committee.

He agreed with the right hon. gent. that a committee considering this subject, must be either limited by instructions of the house, or by their own discretion, to certain specific points. He never listened to a debate with more attention than he had done to the present, and never had he more complete conviction than from this. From every gentleman who spoke, but more particularly from an hon. and learned gentleman, who had most influence with him, on this occasion, the attorney general, who in a clear, able, and honourable speech, had told the house the result of a prosecution by a person in his official situation; by which it was manifest, that the prosecution would come to nothing; for whatever might be the law on the question, whether the party would be obliged to refund the money, which had been unfairly gained, if it was money belonging to the public, (and the learned gent. inclined to the affirmative of that proposition), yet as the prosecution by the attorney general calling on the party to refund, was in the nature of a civil action, it was clearly the opinion of the learned gent. that if the money so unfairly made use of for private emolument, should be held not to be in strictness the money of the public, but the money of the individuals who claimed, its restitution to the public could not be ordered by a court of justice, because the money was not deemed to be the money of the public. The prosecution therefore for restitution to the public, would in this event fail; and he could not help connecting this idea with what he heard on the 8th of this month in the house, from whom he could not recollect, although there was an impression on his mind that it came from the most respectable authority in the house, which was, that the money in question did not belong to the public, but must be considered as the property of individuals; and if so, the prosecution by the attorney general must fail, as far as regarded the recovery of the money. Besides, if the case were not so, and the prosecution was instituted, it would be so easy for Mr. Trotter to transfer to my Lord Melville, or my Lord Melville to transfer to Mr.423Trotter, as the case might suit them, so as to elude all justice. But although this part of the case appeared very important in the views of some person, it was comparatively trivial in the view he took of it altogether. His great anxiety was for the honour and character of the house. It had been said that the house ought never to come to any decision against its judgment, on account of any supposed impression made on the public, that their constituents had no right to bind the house to vote against what appeared just to the house. It was true the public had no right to insist on the judgment of the house being in any particular way on any given case, and that such was his opinion he had given proof in the earlier part of his life; but although the public had no right to tell the house what should be the result of its enquiry, it had a right to say that the house should enquire; that was a duty the house owed to the public; and not only to enquire into any public abuse, but to enquire in the most efficient manner. Now, he had no hesitation in saying, that the most efficient manner appeared to him to be by a committee of the house, and if so, the public would have a right to say, if the house did not adopt that mode, it was guilty of a dereliction of its duty. It was true that neither Mr. Trotter nor my lord Melville, nor any of their agents, would be obliged to answer any thing before a committee of the house to criminate themselves, any more than they would be obliged to do before court of law; but then it must be remembered, that if they refused to answer the committee any fair questions put to them, it would be in the power of the committee to report them as persons misconducting themselves; and as they were person holding offices under government, the might very fairly be cashiered. But as to the examination of Mr. Trotter or lord Melville, he did not think them so important as some others might do. Had he been on the committee of naval enquiry, he doubted whether he should have propose to have examined either; for the great object with him would have been to have looked into the accounts, public and private, for they afforded better evidence than any thing that could be expected to come out of the mouth of any delinquent whatever. Not that he would not have hear them, if they desired it, but he should not think of sending for them as witnesses to explain any matters in which they appeared to424be delinquents, because very little useful information could be expected from them. The question was, what was the power the house was called upon to give out of its hands? That power was no less than that of enquiring into all the minute details of the whole case. Then followed another question, whether if the house gave that power out of its hands, it was reasonable to expect that the hands in which they trusted it, would have the same power of examining the matter as the house had? A question which it was impossible to answer in the affirmative, by adopting the mode proposed by the amendment, therefore, the house would change the best security for a bad one, for preventing future depredations on the public, and that its constituents might call a dereliction of its duty, and were likely to do so, when they found the mode proposed to be adopted by the amendment was the mode which the most particular friends of my lord Melville were the most partial to, which they hardly would do, if they thought it would press hard upon him. He was apprehensive that the public would be justly dissatisfied with the house if it did not do its duty in this case, which it could not do without adopting the mode best calculated to investigate this matter fully, which, in his opinion, would alone be well done by a committee, such as was proposed by his hon. friend's motion.", "author_id": "/people/mr-charles-fox-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

This order imported that no peer of the realm, a, member of that house, should attend the house of commons, or any committee thereof, to answer matters of charge or accusation against themselves, either in person or by their counsel, &c.; on pain of being committed. to the custody of the black rod, or sent to the Tower during the pleasure of that house. His lordship then observed, that the case which was involved by the recent message from the commons, was one of very considerable and peculiar importance; though no consideration of the kind was expressly referred to in the message., yet, from the votes of the house of commons, which had come to his knowledge upon the subject, there was no doubt but matters of charge and accusation against lord viscount Melville were connected with the proceeding. He had therefore, with reference to what he had reason to think would take place, enquired respecting such precedents as existed of such cases; and though he met with several, yet he did not feel himself fully informed, or adequately prepared to recommend at present any distinct line, or course of proceeding. He then adverted to the circumstances which gave rise to the standing order which had been just read, and stated a few cases in the way of precedent, which, he conceived, bore a resemblance to the present. Among these, the case of the duke of Buckingham, who, in March 1626, was required to attend the, house of commons, on matters of charge and accusation against himself. Some farther proceedings took place on that case on the 14th of the following month; the result was, that their lordships resolved the duke should not attend the house of commons. A case nearly similar occurred in the year 1673, in that of the earl of Arlington, who was also required to attend the house of commons to answer on matters of accusation against him. In this case, their lordships, after duly considering the case, and though the earl of Arlington himself desired to be examined, refused their consent, and subsequently resolved upon the standing order now upon the book. In the present instance, he repeated, though the message did589not directly mention matter of accusation against lord viscount Melville, yet he could not avoid observing (not meaning however to give any decided opinion upon the subject) that it expressly referred to the tenth report of the commissioners of naval inquiry, a copy of which was on their lordship's table, and which contained matters of grave and serious accusation against that noble lord. This report, he could collect from the votes of the commons, was referred to a select committee, who were desired to examine into several points contained therein; and, among others, into the application of public monies entrusted to the treasurer of the navy to other services than those of the navy. A proceeding of this kind, so set forth, although it may prove, upon due enquiry and explanation, to be even a meritorious line of conduct; yet,prima facie,it was to be regarded in the light of matter of accusation; therefore, from what evidence they had before them, derived from the report upon the table, and the votes of the house of commons, it might in the first instance be inferred that the intention was to examine the noble viscount upon points which may form matter of accusation against himself. Under these circumstances, particularly referring to the standing order, it was incumbent upon the house seriously to take the case into consideration before an answer should be sent to the commons. He already stated he had not his mind fully made up as to the most proper course to be adopted. He thought that some time, avoiding all unnecessary delay, should be given to noble lords to consider and to enquire as to the precedents in such cases.

He allowed, there were some things attending this mode of raising money by loans, which he did not altogether approve, such as being connected with a sinking fund, and other inconveniences; but it was but fair and right to consider every matter of this kind in all its bearings, and to put up with the bitters, for the sake of enjoying the449sweets.

In 1795, government had thought proper to give orders to seize neutral vessels going to France with provisions. These vessels and the cargoes had been consigned, after a part of the provisions had been taken for the use of government, with the remaining cargoes to Mr. Claude Scott, to be disposed of for the public account. He was informed that the produce of the sale, amounting to two hundred thousand pounds, had been suffered to remain in the hand's of Mr. Scott, down to the year 1800. During this period, Mr. Scott had frequently supplied government with corn to a large amount, which there was reason to suppose he had bought with the public money, and for which he was paid in treasury bills, bearing interest, so that he not only derived mercantile profit from the public money, but also interest from the mode of payment. If these things were true, they were highly culpable: the person who had given him the information pledged himself to make good the fact at the bar; yet he hoped sincerely the hon. gent. could do away the charge. He concluded with moving for a variety of accounts relating to the sale of the vessels and cargoes, the payments made to the lords of the treasury, and the several contracts between Mr. Scott and government for meal and flour, &c.;", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-best", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

My hon. friend has said, that this has overstepped the boundaries436of all that licence that the house has ever allowed to discussions upon its proceedings out of doors: Sir, I have read this article, and I must certainly allow that it is a very severe libel. But when I say this, I must at the same time observe, that though in itself it is extremely improper, yet when compared with a vast variety of other articles that have appeared respecting the proceedings of the house, it is by no means so severe. Indeed, in this view, it may be said to be mere milk and water. But then, my hon. friend says, \"if we are to allow things of this sort to go on, where are we to stop? Is the house of commons to sutler every sort of censure on its proceedings to pass Without any animadversion?\" Why, sir, to this I reply, that if the house is about to adopt a new feeling, and to take notice of expressions of this sort, after they have so long slumbered, and allowed these things to pass unheeded, it ought to give warning that it has changed its sentiments, in order that people may be prepared, and that punishment may not fall on a particular individual, where so many are involved in the same sort of delinquency. I do not say that my hon. friend is not perfectly warranted in the mode of proceeding which he has adopted; but it is but fair at the same time to observe, that time house has been long in the habit of tolerating such paragraphs as that of which complaint is now made. We are accustomed to connive at these things. We connive at reporting our debates, and very properly, because I should consider it as a great, if not a mortal blow to the liberties of this country, that the public should be kept in ignorance of the proceedings in parliament. Now, it ought to be recollected, that we use a great deal more freedom with our own characters than we think it just that other men should do. But when people are obliged to report, if they do report well, the severe things which we say of one another in this house, is it not natural that they should fall into an imitation of our style, and speak of us, in some measure, as we do of ourselves? I do therefore think, that in these cases a great allowance ought to be made. I should be extremely sorry that any thing like a prosecution should take place in this instance. My first reason is, that I am a warm friend to the liberty of the press, and the second is, that I very well remember the usual result of such prosecutions.437I recollect, sir, that a certain libel was some time ago published on the house of commons, and I was one of a committee appointed to discover the author of that pamphlet. I certainly had no doubt that it was a libel; however, when it came into a court of law, an hon. friend of mine had the ingenuity to persuade the jury, that it was no reflection whatever on the house of commons. If, therefore, the author of this paragraph makes an ample apology, which I have no doubt he will be ready to do, I cannot think that the matter ought to be carried farther.

But, however, when a gross breach of privilege is committed, it is not perhaps altogether proper that the offender should escape with impunity. Some allusion has been made to a prosecution by the attorney-general. It does not appear to use that this is the just mode of proceeding on a case of this nature. No court of justice ever, or at least very seldom, adopts the plan of a prosecution in the case of a contempt of court, but almost invariably proceeds by taking the punishment into its own hands. In a libel on the house of commons, therefore, the person who has written it ought more properly to be punished by this house, and it certainly is by no means advisable, that he should be sent to such a mode of trial as has beep alluded to, without strong grounds for so doing. But let me not, at the same time, be misunderstood. I am by no means disposed to favour the disposition to turn matters into contempt of court, which are in fact crimes of entirely a different nature. In this instance, however, it is clear that the offence resembles that of a contempt of court, and as such it ought to be punished by this house, and by no other. I have certainly not often thought it tit to prosecute individuals. But: at the same time I must say, that the gentlemen on the other side have not been remarkable for their forbearance in any case where government has been concerned. I do not, therefore, see why the house of commons should be the only part of the constitutional body that is to be libelled with impunity. I widely differ from my hon, friend, when he says that such a paragraph as this appears almost every day, Undoubtedly I am not in the habit of reading the newspapers so much as he does, but I certainly have scarcely ever seen any thing like this. I defy any gentleman to shew me any such paragraph, There are, indeed, often attacks on individuals, that, strictly speaking, are whol-439ly unjustifiable, but I say, that if such an imputation as this had been thrown on any of the proceedings of the house of commons, when the majority was in favour of administration, it would not be tolerated. No one would dare to do such a thing. I certainly do think this, therefore, an extraordinary case; but at the same time, on the general principle, that the freedom of discussion, either in or out of doors, should not be discouraged, I am free to confess, that I am not of opinion that the punishment ought to be severe.", "author_id": "/people/mr-charles-fox-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

An hon. member, last night, had proposed a mode of selecting the committee, which he was persuaded would have been much more likely to have obtained a fair and impartial selection, than that which was the pleasure of the house to adopt, namely, to propose the members one at a time from each side of the house, and then it would have been fairly seen how far his majesty's ministers were disposed to accede to that principle of impartial investigation, to which some of them had professed themselves so friendly. But he well knew from past experience, that the mode adopted was not the one likely to obtain an impartial selection. There was an important occasion, some years since, which occurred to his recollection. It was a ballot proposed for selecting a committee of East-India judicature; upon which occasion, as well as on many others well known, it was irrefragably and flagrantly obvious, that the ballot for a committee was but a mere mask for the nomination of the minister; and that in fact, the names of the persons to serve had been previously determined by ministers; that the lists of those names were made up at the treasury, and put by ministers into the hands of their friends. Now, if the fact was so in the present case, it was necessary the house should know it; and the comparison of the list, in the hand of his hon. friend, with the return of the scrutineers, would be a pretty strong criterion of the truth.

With respect to the personal delicacy of any man, acting under such circumstances as those in which the right hon. gent. stood, that was certainly his own consideration; but if he (Mr. Fox) was the person closely connected with delinquents, he should feel himself bound, by considerations of personal delicacy, to take special care not to be the man to bring forward such an enquiry, and to name the committee, for carrying it on, conscious as he must be of the sentiments such a circumstance must produce in the opinions of all thinking men.

The navy and the army were undoubtedly two great branches of public expenditure, in which great abuses had unquestionably occurred, but there were still others that as loudly challenged enquiry. Did the right hon. gent. think that enquiry was not full as necessary in the expenditure of the treasury, so much more immediately connected with himself? and upon the same principle, if he were to bring enquiry forward and name the committee, he might as well nominate the lords of the treasury at once to investigate and censure their own delinquencies, if they were guilty. But that those persons whose conduct was the object of enquiry should be permitted to nominate the enquirers, was contrary to every principle of common justice, common decency, and common sense. But let not the right hon. gent. \"lay this flattering unction to his soul,\" that after what had passed in that house, after the enormities that had already been dragged to light, the public would be satisfied with the appointment of a commission by himself, to enquire into those branches of the public service with which he himself was immediately connected.

Such a reflection from any man in the house would excite surprise, but from the right hon. gent. on such an occasion too, it must he peculiarly surprising. Not only that he was quite sure it was decidedly opposite to the general opinion of that house, and the universally received sentiment of the country, that those commissioners were in any part of their conduct deserving of censure. So far from it, that there could be no doubt that the public feeling was warmly in their favour, too much so indeed to afford any thing like a gracious reception to the right hon. gent.'s remarks. Those commissioners, in his judgment, and he believed there were very few who really differed from him, had discharged their duty with peculiar moderation and justice. If the right hon. gent. thought that they had in any instance deviated from that duty, or made an improper exercise of the power intrusted to them, it was incumbent on him to have stated it, and not to have dealt in loose insinuation. Persuaded of the merits of this commission, and that where the results of its enquiry were in any case imperfect, that imperfection did not proceed from any want of diligence or capacity on their part, but from a deficiency in the powers with which they were invested, he should move an amendment, the object of which would be to remove that deficiency. The first point upon which he would propose to extend the power of the commissioners, would be to compel public officers to furnish them with accounts or documents in such form as they might think proper to specify. Thus, no treasurer of the navy, or other public officer, or deputy, would be permitted to thwart or delay the proceedings of this meritorious commission. The next amendment he would submit would go to repeal or new-model the 5th clause, which appeared to have been so improperly made use of to prevent the full disclosure of public delinquency, and to protect delinquents. These effects, which were notorious, and which occasioned general regret, must impress the mind of every man who was really anxious for the success of this enquiry, with a strong conviction of the necessity for this amendment. No objection could be made to a further extension of the pow-486ers of those commissioners from any apprehension that that power was likely to be abused; for against such an apprehension the discreet and moderate manner in which they had heretofore acted must afford sufficient security. According to the act, as it now stands, every person had, it seems, a right to decline to answer any question which he chose to think might tend to criminate himself. This afforded such a latitude as was calculated completely to defeat all enquiry, and he would appeal to the learned gent. on the other side (the attorney general), whether any man would be permitted in a court of law to decline answering a question merely upon his own conception that the answer might tend to criminate him. The practice, on the contrary, was, he apprehended, that if a man declined, upon such an allegation, to give an answer, the court was competent to say, that it did not appear likely the answer would produce such an effect, and that therefore the witness must answer. If, however, the answer should tend to criminate the witness, the common law would protect him against the consequences. Now, it was his wish to invest the naval commissioners with a discretion of the same nature as that possessed by the judges&#x2014;that they should have the power of compelling reluctant witnesses to answer &#x2014;that such witnesses should be protected by this act, not against the answer, but against the consequences of such answer.

It would be preferable to go into the committee, to ascertain the precise nature of the information wanted, and adopt measures to obtain it. The measure before the house was, he contended, brought forward on adequate parliamentary grounds. The real merits of the bill, as it then stood,453resolved into this question, did there now exist sufficient grounds for continuing the restriction? With respect to the apprehension of a rapid succession, he thought those persons who so worthily presided in the different colleges would take care to prevent that; but he was inclined, upon the whole, to credit the assertion that the present succession to the college livings was too slow, and in considering this part of the subject, the peculiarly strong claims of those who were to be ameliorated by the bill, should be attended to. The question under consideration was not of figures or of numerical calculation, but of reasoning, feeling, and presumption. With respect to that salutary and beneficial connection which subsisted between the property of the laity, and the religious establishments of the country, did he perceive the least tendency in the bill to militate against the measure; but with a most reverend prelate, he thought it would have a contrary tendency. He had no fears on that head, for even did too great an accumulation of advowsons, or too rapid a succession ensue, the legislature might hereafter interpose and check it, as it had already done.

The restriction, at present, he argued, operated unjustly, it referred merely to the number of the advowsons, without in the least considering their respective value.

{"date": ["1805", "apr", "29"], "content": "entirely concurred with his hon. friend in thinking the insinuation thrown out against the naval commissioners by the right hon. gent. who had just sat down, a most extraordinary circumstance indeed, particularly when the time at which the right hon. gent. expressed his disapprobation was taken into view. If the ground of this disapprobation was of a serious and important nature, it was highly inconsistent in him to bring forward the motion before the house. For if the commissioners were deserving of such censure, how could the right hon. gent. reconcile it with a just sense of public duty, to propose the continuance of their power? But if, on the contrary, the grounds of the right hon. gent.'s disapprobation were of a trifling or comparatively unimportant nature, how strange was the opportunity chosen for declaring, it! There was something peculiarly remarkable in the conduct of the right hon. gent. respecting this commission. At such a time, what could he mean by alluding to trivial errors&#x2014;Just hint a fault and hesitate dislike, Anxious to wound, and yet afraid to strike.Those two lines appeared to be quite appropriate to express the disposition of the right hon. gent., they seemed to be made for him. With respect to the proposition488of his hon. friend, gentlemen would consider that the adoption of it would not go to bind the house to any subsidiary amendments that might be hereafter submitted. He merely proposed that as an amendment was obviously necessary in this act, that the original title of the bill should correspond with the desired object. If the amendments recommended by his hon. friend were calculated to entrench on the great and fundamental principles of common law, he would not, from any degree of regard or gratitude to the commissioners of naval enquiry, and no man respected them more than he did, be induced to assent to their adoption. He wished not that any man should be bound to criminate himself; but, in any act which had for its object to compel public officers to account for their conduct of the public money, he was very unwilling that a clause should exist, calculated to shelter any public officer from rendering such account, if he chose to decline it. At least, any officer who should avail himself of such a clause, and thus explicitly declare an apprehension of the discovery of his guilt, ought not to be allowed, for one moment afterwards, to retain his office. The case was different with respect to private individuals. But, when the public thought proper to appoint a commission to enquire into the conduct of its stewards or agents, was it to be borne that any one of such servants should refuse to answer the questions of such a commission; but, still more, was it tolerable that after such refusal he should remain in office? If a public officer were innocent, why should he wish to be silent, and, if he were guilty, why should the legislature protect him in his silence? He did not mean of course that any officer should be forced to furnish grounds of prosecution against himself, but that, if he persisted in that conduct which clearly implied a consciousness of delinquency, he should be dismissed from office. Gentlemen often appeared to forget the nature of these commissions. They were in fact, to be considered as the representatives of the public, examining the conduct of public servants. If a master were to appoint any person to enquire into the affairs of his family, and a servant were to refuse to answer such questions as might be put to him, from a fear of criminating himself, would such a servant be permitted to retain his place? Certainly not. Why, then, should a treasurer of the navy, or his clerk, or any other public servant,489however high, he allowed to remain in office after refusing to answer to the agent of their master for the manner in which they had managed his concerns, particularly when their refusal betrayed a sense of guilt? Whether public officers should be compellable to answer such commissions or not, it ought, surely, in common sense and equity, be understood that a refusal to answer should be immediately followed by dismissal. If that were understood, then the refusal of the 5th clause would not be so essentially necessary, although still a provision to meet such a case as that of Mark Sprott would be called for. That person declined to answer, on the ground that he was not, being no public officer, compellable to answer questions under the act. So he was advised by the lawyers whom he consulted. Perhaps those lawyers were Bright, but whether or not, it was proper to extend and explain the powers of the commissioners so as to leave no room for doubt or cavil, and to enable them fully to execute the purpose of their appointment. The hon. member repeated, that it was desirable to be understood that such a commission as that under consideration was not to be viewed by public officers as a hostile court of enquiry, but as a representative of the public, to which they are as much obliged to account, as any servants are to the enquiry of their masters.", "author_id": "/people/mr-charles-fox-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

The right hon. gent.'s leading objections were directed against the suggestions of his hon. friend (Mr. Whitbread), for enabling the board to enforce answers to such interrogatories as they should deem necessary, from the witnesses brought before them, without having the objects of their enquiry defeated by pretences that those persons were not bound to answer interrogatories, tending to their own crimination. His hon. friend never meant, he was confident, to expose any man to the severity of criminal proceedings, in consequence of any testimony extorted from him by the authority of the commissioners; and the law of the land would protect him in such a case. The house, certainly, in appointing the board of commissioners for the purpose of naval enquiry, did not surrender any of its own privileges; neither did he conceive the house to have warranted any individual to direct his censures against the conduct of those commissioners which it had so highly approved: and before the right hon. gent. proceeded to direct such heavy censures against that board, it was incumbent upon him to have pointed out those parts of their conduct which called for his reprobation. He had himself given notice of an intention to move for the thanks of that house to the commissioners of naval enquiry, for that conduct which had already excited the universal gratitude of the country without doors; and when he should have the honour of bringing that motion forward in a day or two, he should hope, if not for the concurrence of the right hon. gent., at least for some explanation of those parts of the conduct of the commissioners, which he had taken so untimely and unqualified an occasion to censure. The commissioners of enquiry had complained that their powers were defective, inasmuch as they had no power to enforce the answers to which his hon. friend alluded; and the right hon. gent. was all alarm, lest public officers should be placed in the liability of criminating their conduct, by telling the truth. It did not appear however, from491the existing state of things, that self-crimination was much the order of the day But he would beg leave to ask the right hon. gent. if he was always so much alive to constitutional feelings on this point or whether he had forgotten the bill introduced by himself into that house in 1785. for the express purpose of enquiring into abuses which had obtained in the fees of the public offices of government, by which bill, the commissioners appointed under it were invested with such powers as completely stripped all persons brought before them of those rights now so warmly and pertinaciously contended for by the right hon. gent.? Did the right hon. gent. on that occasion plead Magna Charta in support of his arguments, when he gave the most decided resistance to the admission of a clause moved by him (Mr. Sheridan), for the protection of persons aginst the extortion of answers tending to their own crimination? Did the right hon, gent. forget that the identical Mr. Trotter, of whose rights he was now so jealous, was, under the former bill, compelled to answer interrogatories similar to those which he had refused answering to the commissioners of naval enquiry? which circumstance is alluded to in the appendix to the tenth report. So far, however, from agreeing with the unqualified censures thrown by the right hon. gent. upon the commissioners of naval enquiry, he thought the house was bound to them by every sentiment of the most unlimited gratitude; and when he should have the honour of calling for the expression of that gratitude, by a motion of thanks, he should frame his motion, so as either to make it impossible for the right hon. gent. to dissent from him, or compel him to shew some reasonable cause for his dissent. He agreed with the right hon. and learned gent. that there was no very great likelihood of frequent or confidential intercourse between his hon. friend (Mr. Whitbread), and, the right hon. gent. who introduced the original motion. If, however, the right hon. gent. wished to have any suggestion as to the amendments which were deemed necessary in the bill, as by courtesy of the house he had the nomination of the committee to prepare and bring it in, perhaps he would act wisely in nominating on that committee his hon. friend. and some of those near him.", "author_id": "/people/mr-richard-sheridan-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

Any other mode must be open to disappointments, inconvenience, and delay. The attention of the public was fixed on the proceedings of the house, and of the courts of judicature, to which they should resort for justice and punishment of the offenders. He was averse from allowing the possibility of the ends of justice being defeated, or that any disappointment should flow from such a quarter; that the public should find that they were so short-sighted, ignorant, and improvident as to the decision which must follow. It was their duty; they were called on to preserve the good opinion of the public in the course of law of the kingdom; and, so far as in them lay, not to allow the public mind to relax in any share of that love, confidence, and affection in their proceedings which we knew at present existed. Here a great public delinquent had been proclaimed to the country. His offence had even been in part acknowledged: but when parliament carried him into a court of law, nothing could be made of him! He approved of the observation of the hon. bart. (sir John Newport). It was not money which that house and the country sought for in this instance; it was for the adoption of that proceeding which should best consult the dignity and honour of parliament, and of the nation.

Failure was at this moment greatly to be deprecated. It was not against the courts of law alone that the obloquy would attach. Parliament would also come in for its share. He was not anxious for popularity, he was solely solicitous to preserve unbroken, those bonds of esteem, affection, and confidence, which he hoped would always continue to subsist between the people of this country and parliament.

Sir, I say, that in what I have done, I have proceeded with deliberation, and I am not sorry for any step I have taken. I wish to proceed in both ways. I mean after the house had declared itself upon that part of the charge which is indisputable, I wished for a committee to ascertain every thing else connected with the subject. The house has decided upon the violation of the law, but not upon the participation of viscount Melville in the profits. Now what says the right hon. gent. (Mr. Pitt)? He advises us to try a civil suit for the participation, while the law officers of the crown admitted it had little chance of success. I therefore wish for a mode by which effectual justice may be done, and that is a committee of the whole house. That a great wound has been inflicted upon my lord Melville by the discovery, I admit; but is that a punishment? When a grand jury finds a bill, is that a punishment for the offence charged, and is the case not to be sent for trial to a petty jury? I admit that the vote of the house compelled the resignation of lord Melville; but there is a great deal of difference between that resignation and his dismissal. The people should have seen and known that he was dismissed. The effect ought to have been plain and palpable to the understanding of every man. If a civil suit were to discover that the money was picked out of the pocket of the public, would that be punishment, unless followed by restitution? I admit I might have the-committee, and the right hon. gent. said he would not oppose it; but to obtain his concurrence, I must have abandoned the particular case in question, and acquiesced in an attempt to cloak and screen lord Melville, and that I did not choose to do.

He himself had remained to a late hour in expectation of the motion being brought forward, and he was at last astonished to find, that the hon. baronet had brought forward the motion at a time when not one of the noble lord's friends were at all apprized of his intentions. They knew nothing at all of the nature of the papers to be moved for.

If the hon. baronet had not the documents necessary to his defence, certainly it would be unfair; but if his comment on them had been omitted, it would have been competent in him to have made it, as a member of parliament, in his place. If he had stated what the inclosures were, all this difficulty would have been avoided. Had he pointed them out by specific titles, it would have been competent to any gentleman to have this or that by itself, which may mislead the house, and therefore it will be necessary to move for some other papers.

He was of opinion it would be more dignified and consistent, not to have these papers printed till others connected with them could be also produced. Every one was aware that there was no man in the country above enquiry; but such was the character of lord St. Vincent, that if the letter accused him, the general and just opinion of mankind would be, that the imputation was unme-464rited.

I have the honour to be, my lords, &c.; &c.; (Signed)A. S. Hamond.\" \"Statement and Declaration.&#x2014;On reading the eleventh report of the commissioners of naval enquiry, and particularly the evidence given by the earl of St, Vincent, as stated in the appendix to that report, which appears to me not to be correct;I have judged it proper to make the following declaration. I declare, 1st, That I have written documents in my possession (copies of which are hereunto annexed) which appear to me to prove that his lordship had a thorough knowledge of one of the transactions; all knowledge of which he has denied:&#x2014;And, 2dly, I declare, that although I have no written testimony to prove that his lordship was actually acquainted with the other transaction set north in that report; and also stated in the appendix by his lordship to have been unknown to him; yet that his lordship was not unacquainted with its having taken place; and the fact of his having denied the one, which is capable of distinct proof, may tend to confirm my declaration upon the other, as the same degree of forgetfulness which occasioned his denial of the one might occasion a similar mistake in his denial of the other. I therefore declare, that feeling it to be my duty to take care that the first lord of the admiralty should be informed generally of the transactions of my office, and particularly, of such as were out of the ordinary course of proceeding; I took occasion not long after the earl of St. Vincent came into office as first lord of the admiralty, to ask his lordship if his predecessor lord Spencer had acquainted him with any service going on under the authority of his probation or order, that still remained unexecuted, and to which I might have occasion hereafter to call upon his lordship468for his sanction; and his answer was, that lord Spencer had not mentioned any circumstance of the kind to him, or left any memorandum, having emptied his drawers previous to his (lord St. Vincent) taking possession of his office room. I then told his lordship, that it became my duty to inform him of various particulars that I considered absolutely necessary he should he acquainted with.

I also informed his lordship, that Mr. Lindegren was employed as an agent to procure hemp for the navy through the neutral merchants, (the Russian ports being then shut against this country); which his lordship also approved of, and continued.&#x2014;I stated likewise to his lordship, all the circumstances that had occurred in the change of the mode of paying the navy bill; sheaving what an immense saving it had been to the public; and the difficulties which arose in 1797 in first getting the ninety-day bills into circulation; and informed him of the expedient the treasury had been obliged to resort to for keeping up their credit, when there did not happen to be money in the exchequer to discharge them.&#x2014;And I do as confidently assert, upon the same principle, and either at the same time, or shortly afterwards, I informed his lordship of all the circumstances of the transaction relative to the issue of the 100,000l. stated in page 491 of the commissioners report, and which is described by me to he of a nature not fit as yet to be made. the subject of a public report: and I add now, that I not only am ready to give to your lordships the most complete explanation of the transaction; but I subjoin to this statement and declaration a copy of a letter, which, though subsequent to my examination, vet previous to their making their report, I sent to the commissioners of naval enquiry, tender-469ing to give them also every information upon that point, provided they would not make it the subject of a public report; and which letter, if they had added to their appendix would have shewn that it was not a transaction which I had any wish to keep secret, except so far as the disclosure of it would be detrimental to the public service; and I do declare, that I believe, if the commissioners had entered into this examination, which I tendered in that letter, that they would have had no difficulty in staring, that the reasons upon which I was desirous to observe this secrecy, were perfectly satisfactory and sufficient. And I do declare, that with respect to the last issue of 30,000lthe order for which is dated from the treasury on the 14th March 1801, it was considered as forming a part of the above transaction, and took place before Mr. Pitt quitted office, although the bills were not actually passed until the 9th April, and therefore this particular issue was not distinguished by me, when I related the circumstance to lord St. Vincent.

I find the hoard has already signified to you, that the navy ninety-day bills, mentioned in your said precept, on the days and for the sums particularized, were issued, by my written directions, to the committee of accounts, in consequence of secret orders I had received from government for specific purposes, and which were kept in my possession.&#x2014; I have now the honour to acquaint you, that the first sum stated in your precept, was issued by directions from the lords commissioners of the treasury, dated 4th October 1792, and markedmost secret.The subsequent issues, viz. 22d November 1799, and 9th April 1801, were made by similar orders. The service for which these naval payments were made, was communicated to me in confidence, and I consider it to be of so delicate a nature, that although the late treasury board signified in a secret letter to me from Mr. Vansittart, dated 1st May 1804, \"That the individual in question had performed the service for which the navy bills had been issued, to their lordship's satisfaction, and therefore directed the navy board to make out a clearing bill to discharge Mr. &#x2014; and his partners from the responsibility of the debt to government;\" yet I am decidedly of opinion, that even mentioning the name of the parties, with the sums issued to them at the particular periods before-mentioned, in any report to be laid before the public, would not only endanger the loss of a great part of the money to government, but would subject the party who had been employed to very great inconvenience.&#x2014;I therefore submit these circumstances to your consideration, as I find it impracticable to give you a copy of the orders tinder which I acted, \"omitting the secret instructions respecting the services to be \"performed,\" as they are contained in almost every line of the authority: I am, nevertheless, ready to lay before you, privately, all the papers relative to the transaction, provided I am assured that it is not to be publicly reported upon, as in474that case I should consider myself not at liberty to make the communication without first consulting the government. With respect to the 2d issue of navy bills to Messrs. Hammersley and Co., I beg leave to acquaint, you that lord Hobart, one of his majesty's principal secretaries of state, signified to me the king's pleasure, that I should take under my control, and provide funds for the preparation of a project intended to be carried into execution on the enemy's coast (a copy of which I have the honour to inclose in obedience to your precept); and considering it more for the interest of the public, that the funds should be in the hands of a banker, rather than in those of a person unknown to me, and over whom, whilst money was at his command, I could expect to have but little control; I judged it most advisable to have the money imprested to Messrs. Hammersley, and Co. who have no other concern in the transaction than paying such bills as had my approval. I have the honour to be, &c.; (Signed)A. S.

That evidence stood unimpeached. The house had an interest in the character of lord St. Vincent, and his private friends had an interest. The charge here was no less than one of direct perjury. It was the general fate of all men in high situations to subject themselves to calumny, if they touched the work of corruption. He would aver, and that without fear of contradiction, that with regard to the secret expedition, lord St. Vincent never did give his sanction to it. Lord St. Vincent uniformly protested against the appropriation of naval money to any but naval services, or to other purposes than those for which it was voted by parliament. His lordship uniformly took care that not one farthing of the public money of his department should be misapplied. Lord St. Vincent never made any appointment of a single naval officer to the expedition, although he night have desired lord Keith to give it a convoy. The whole was left to the persons appointed by the treasury. The papers which were just read, had nothing to do with the charges against lord St. Vincent. By lord Hobart's letter, it appeared that the whole expense was to he defrayed by the treasury. Lord St. Vincent washed475his hands of it When he returned to sir A. Hamond the letter of lord Hobart. To be sure, it was impossible for lord St. Vincent, as a member of the cabinet, not to have known of the expedition, but he had no participation in lodging navy money in the hands of the hon. baronet. Here then ends, in the face of the house, the first charge against lord St. Vincent, and the remarkable phrase that either the situation of lord St. Vincent or sir Andrew Hamond would appear from the papers, one in which no man of honour would wish to stand. As a seaman, lord St. Vincent gave his opinion respecting the project for choaking up the harbours of the enemy; but, as a servant of the public, he had never departed from his resolution not to use the public money against the votes of parliament.

With respect to the testimony given by lord St. Vincent before the naval commissioners, and annexed to the eleventh report, his (Mr. Hobhouse's) impression upon reading it agreed with the statements of his right hon. friend below him (Mr. Vansittart), and of his right hon. friend near bun (Mr. Sullivan); both of whom, from the public situations they at that time filled, were well acquainted with the whole proceeding, and most capable of forming a correct judgment.

He trusted, however, that it would not be necessary for him to occupy much of the time563of the house, and as he thought that the general feelings of the house, and of the country at large, were with him, it would, perhaps, be the best mode to submit his motion without other comment or preface than simple reference to the Reports on the table. But as the right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer had expressed his disapprobation of the conduct of the commissioners as in some instances unbecoming, it would be necessary for him to preface his motion with a few observations. But he should not dwell on the subject at any length, as he trusted that the right hon. gent. if he did not retract would at least not press his objections to the motion. Notice vets given of the right hon. gent.'s intention to renew the commission. Surely, if the commissioners were to be re-appointed, they ought to have distinctly pointed out to them what appeared erroneous or unbecoming in their proceedings, that such errors might, in future, be avoided. Knowing, then, that some objections did exist, it was necessary for him to request the attention of the house for a few moments previous to his submitting his motion. It was almost needless for him to state what were the circumstances under which the commissioners had been appointed. If they had done their duty well, they had done so under peculiar circumstances, and in opposition to formidable difficulties. They were not called on to investigate the small peccadillos of clerks and underlings in office; they were required to investigate the abuses of the heads of great departments, to look men in high situations in the face, and, acting with firmness and intrepidity, to expose abuses wherever they fell under the range of their inquiries. Very different indeed was the task of the commissioners who had been appointed under the auspices of the right hon. gent. to which, on a former day, he had felt it his duty to call the attention of the house. The right hon. gent. had recommended to him to read the terms of that commission, to be convinced of his erroneous view of its nature Nod extent. He had attended to that recommendation; he had fully considered the terms under which the commissioners were to act, and his opinion remained unchanged. A full power was indeed given to the commissioners to make the fullest investigation, and no fifth clause existed to shelter any one from answering whatever questions were put to him, even if the answers should have a tendency to criminate himself. There was, however, an564important distinction to be attended to, and that was, while the principals in the different offices were to remain unmolested, the whole weight of inquiry or censure was to fall on the subordinate officers. Indeed the right hon. gent.'s act was one of the most liberal, polite, and well bred acts of parliament that ever was framed. It took it for granted that it was impossible for a principal in an office to be-guilty even of the least irregularity; but he might be the willing and active auxiliary of the commissioners, by compelling all those under him to give them whatever information they required. Thus came the right hon. gent.'s commissioners to the execution of. the duties committed to their care, and he had surely no occasion to remind the house under what circumstances the commissioners of naval enquiry entered on their duties. When their appointment was first proposed, it was contended, even by some hon. gent. on his side of the house, that the appointment was unnecessary ; and it was artfully insinuated through the country, that it was not a board of commissioners, but a body of inquisitors, that was about to be established. It was well known, that lord St. Vincent was the person who proposed the establishment of the commission, and no sooner were they appointed than the character of his lordship was on all hands assailed; various motions were threatened, and one hon. baronet had brought forth a positive charge, though, unfortunately, not one member of the house could be found to second it. Such was the situation of the commissioners almost immediately posterior to their appointment. The house would also bear in mind that the right hon. gent. opposite (Mr. Pitt) brought forward a motion positively accusing lord St. Vincent of improper and negligent conduct in the administration of the affairs of the navy. And here it would be easily seen, that the commissioners were placed under very disadvantageous circumstances, considering that the character of him under whose auspices they were to act, was thus directly attacked, on the score of incapacity. To this attack a total change of administration succeeded; and here again the commissioners had to contend with new difficulties&#x2014;they were to carry on their inquiries when all those on whose support and encouragement much reliance was to be placed, were removed from office. Indeed, from the language of the right. hon. gent. on his return to office they had little hope of encouragement. He565had then declared that, from all he had seen, and all he had heard, or known, every one his reasons for attacking the administration of the noble lord had. been confirmed, and the commissioners were to act under the impression that the conduct of the noble lord who had established them was peremptorily condemned. With all the difficulties, with all these undeniable disadvantages, they had, however, proceeded with intrepidity, and the public saw what was the result. The grand obstacle in a way of their inquiries was derived from a most extraordinary use to which the fifth clause of the bill under which they acted had been applied. It was quite clear that the commissioners never expected that this clause should be applied to the purposes which their own reports explained, or that even in the office of the treasurer of the navy, which was as it were the flag-ship t all the other offices, they should begin to experience the most serious difficulties in the execution of their duty. What then appeared on the face of their reports? On the 10th of July they send a precept to the treasurer of the navy (Mr. Canning), requiring the production of certain document essential to the proper prosecution of their inquiries, and receiving no answer, they repeat the precept on the 17th of the same month. The 2d of October arrives, and previous to that period his right hon. friend had given the commissioners no sort of in formation. Was it then to be endured commissioners acting under the authority o the three branches of the legislature should thus be trifled with? Was any gentleman, however high his influence or extensive his power, to set their authority on a subject of such vast importance at utter defiance? Yet all these difficulties had been overcome by the indefatigable zeal, diligence and fortitude of the commissioners. The house would keep in view that, with respect to the distribution of the public money, three great duties were to be performed. In the first instance, the house had to grant supplies adequate to the exigencies of the public services, founded on proper estimates laid regularly before them by the express command of his majesty. The ways and means to provide this supply were next to be considered; and it was the object of the house to lay the burthens on the people at large in a manner which would operate with as little severity as possible. The third duty of the house was one, however, still more important, and one without which the other two would be in a great measure nugatory566and inefficient, and this was the mode in which the votes of the house were to be applied. The two first of these duties could only be exercised by the house itself: but it was frequently the custom of the house to delegate the other to commissioners; and certainly if such commissioners were appointed, it became a matter of the highest interest to see that they were implicitly obeyed. If the, house delegated to certain individuals the most important of its powers, it was proper that these individuals should be sensible that they were to meet with ample encouragement and support. Without confidence, their labours for the discovery or the correction of abuses could never produce any satisfactory result. At this moment, there was a notice of the renewal of the commissioners of naval inquiry, and it was therefore proper that it should be fully understood in what light their conduct was regarded by those who had such means of giving their conduct and inquiries full efficiency. It was not sufficient to say that their conduct was, on the whole, worthy of approbation; or, that there was more to praise than to blame in their exertions for the discovery and correction of abuses. The commissioners were professedly selected out of the talents, the respectability, and the worth of the country, and it ought, therefore, to be fairly understood, whether their conduct was not admitted to be such as to entitle them to unequivocal approbation and confidence. If this was not allowed by those who were to bring forward the proposition for the renewal of the commission, then he himself must insist, that though the commission was renewed, other commissioners ought to be appointed. It was ridiculous to say, that if they were unfit, other gentlemen fully qualified for the task could not be procured. The right hon. gent. was bound to state his opinion fairly to the house, for he himself was resolved that the re-appointment of the commissioners should take place under no compromise.&#x2014;Having said this, he wished briefly to direct the attention of the house to what the commissioners had done, to what remained for them to do, and then it would be seen whether they ought to be reappointed. The attention of the house had been so much attracted to the tenth report, that the other reports of the commissioners had been passed over with comparatively. small notice. In the other reports, it was true that nothing of so high game was disclosed, but many gross frauds had been brought to light, many important improve-567merits had been recommended. In all of them the ability, the diligence, the unconquerable fortitude of the commissioners had been, eminently conspicuous. It would not be necessary for him to go into any detail, but it was proper just to give a sketch of what each of the reports contained. In the first report it was ascertained that in the offices in Jamaica connected with the navy, the public, through the negligence and fraud of one of the officers, sustained a loss of about thirty-six thousand pounds in bills, and upwards of one hundred and thirty-five thousand pounds from lavish waste, and other causes arising from the manner in which business was conducted. The second report referred to the mismanagement of the chest at Chatham, and displayed a scene of the most infamous peculation. The rewards allotted to our brave seamen for their meritorious exertions in defence of all that is dear to freemen, had been found to have been most shamefully misapplied. In many cases the harpies of agents had appropriated nearly thirty-four per cent. of what was intended to assuage, the sufferings of those who had bled in the cause of their, country. The necessity of entering an appearance once in three years, even from Ireland and the most distant parts of the island, only to ascertain whether veterans and invalids had grown younger, was properly exposed by the commissioners, and a suitable remedy had been provided. The third report was on the infamous overcharges in the crock yards. The house and the public would form a pretty good idea on the subject, when they were Oven to understand that, in one article, there was charge of one thousand and forty pounds, when before the commissioners it was found that thirty-four pounds was the fair price. These evils had been sifted to the bottom. and the gross frauds of those who were fat telling on the public would now happily be prevented. In the fifth report the evils o the sixpenny office, so essential to the proper provision made for invalids in the navy were fully exposed; and the sixth very clearly stewed that vast sums were charged for work done in the dock yards, not one third of which was ever performed. The commissioners stated a sum of nearly eight hundred thousand pounds, one third which could not be accounted for in a satisfactory manner. In the seventh report a case was stated of the repairs of the Amaranthe, in Woolwich dock-yard, where the expence had been carried as high as three568thousand eight hundred and fifty-three pounds, whereas on examination it appeared that somewhat more than five hundred pounds was the real amount. The ninth report related to the receipt of stores in Plymouth dock, and though the matter was not sufficiently clucidated, enough was stated to shew that gross frauds had existed. On the tenth it was needless for him to enlarge, as it had sufficiently attracted the attention of the house and the public. The eleventh report he should not now insert, as it was to be the subject of a specific motion by an hon. and learned friend of his on no very distant day. He begged leave, however, in the mean time, to call the attention of the house to this report, as one of very high importance, as one which disclosed transactions equally contrary to law and to fair constitutional principles, as were indeed calculated to give a vital stab to the credit and character Of the country.&#x2014;Having thus gone through the different reports, all of which evinced the most commendable gence and zeal, the hon. gentleman next specified what vet remained for examination. There still remained the proceedings of the navy board, the victualling, the transport, and the sick and hurt boards. Of the necessity of investigating this last board, no doubt could exist, after what an hon. admiral(Markham) had said, that of all the boards hitherto unexplored, this was the most grossly corrupt. The dock-yards abroad, too, opened a wide field for inquiry; he believed, in many cases, it would be found that charges of nineteen shillings a ton were made, when four shillings and twopence covered the whole expence. The ordnance department, also, would come in for its share of investigation; in many cases gross frauds were committed, and there was one case Where fifty thousand stand of arms were purchased, after surveyors, properly appointed, had declared them unfit for service. They had also to enquire how far the officers in the treasury knew of, or had any feeling in this transaction; and,last of all, they had to enquire into the expenditure and abuses of the money which ought to be appropriated for the benefit off Greenwich hospital, that noble and beneficent asylum for our brave and gallant seamen, after they have lost their limbs, exhausted their constitutions, or worn out best part of their lives in the service of their king and country. If they have such material business still to perform, which cannot be done without a continuation of that zeal, firmness,569ability, and fortitude, which they have exerted on every former occasion; after the slurs and insinuations which have been thrown out against their conduct, it became peculiarly incumbent on the house to convince them on the present occasion that, in continuing them in the performance of those arduous duties they had yet to sustain, they might depend upon receiving every encouragement and support which the house could give them. Reform, he said, was a thing which, on all occasions, had been most odious; but at present there was such a host of contractors, jobbers, and other descriptions of persons, who were used to derive advantage from the improvident expenditure of the public money, that the outcry against the commissioners, and the resistance made to their efforts for the public service, were such as had never been experienced at any antecedent period. On these considerations, he thought, that if any material objection were brought by the right hon. gent. or others, against the vote of thanks he was about to move, the house ought not by any means to encourage the idea of their re-appointment to the same commission. But, if there were no such objections, it was the duty of the house to stand forward, and to say, with that commanding force which should be heard from one end of the kingdom to the other, that these commissioners have hitherto nobly and honourably executed the high and portant trust reposed in them by the house; and that in what they have hereafter to do, the house will cheerfully support them to the utmost extent of their power. He would not, therefore, detain the house any longer than to read his motion, which he did accordingly to the following purport:&#x2014; \"That it appears to this house, that the Commissioners appointed by an act of the 43d of the king, to enquire into the irregularities and abuses committed by persons employed in the several naval departments, have, as far as appears from their reports hitherto made, exerted themselves with great diligence, ability, and fortitude, and that the whole of their conduct, in the execution of the arduous duties intrusted to them, is intitled to the approbation and thanks of this house.\"&#x2014;The motion being put from the Chair,", "author_id": "/people/mr-richard-sheridan-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

He animadverted on the several charges which had been advanced by the right hon. gent. who spoke last against the commissioners of naval enquiry. As to the first, which regarded what the right hon. gent. professed to consider the premature publication of any of the subjects referred to in the several reports from this commission&#x2014;he could not deem it any fair ground of accusation against the commissioners; for it did not appear that they had designedly given publicity to the rumours referred to. Besides, indeed, whether such things were kept secret or not in the way desired by the right hon. gent. appeared to him to be a matter scarcely worth notice. As to the case of the comptroller of the navy hoard and his alledged misappropriation of the money entrusted to his care, the right hon. gent. seemed to think that if opportunity for explanation had been afforded that comptroller, as well as to lord St. Vincent, much confusion would have been avoided, as appeared in a part of the noble lord's evidence in the eleventh report. Now, for his part, he saw no such confusion. Even without the explanation recently offered to the house on this point, he really thought that nothing could be clearer from the context of the evidence, and from a fair consideration of Lord St. Vincent's answers to the two questions which were lately the subject of discussion, than that the noble lord was ignorant of the money matters which formed thegravamenof the charge against the comptroller of the navy. But the right hon. gent. asked why was not this comptroller examined by the commissioners touching this charge, as well as the earl of St. Vincent? He would tell that right hon. gent. that the comptroller of the navy was examined, and that he defended himself from answering questions under the 5th clause. After having done so, then he would, put it to the right hon. gent. whether, if he himself were one those commissioners, he would propose to examine again him or any man who so acted? With respect to the statements of the right hon. gent. as to the574conduct of this commission in the first report, he must observe, that if those statements were well founded, the navy board seemed to have been very passive under the serious imputations cast upon them. They professed to feel themselves very unjustly accused. The report containing this accusation had lain on the table for nearly two years, since June 1803, and during that period the commissioners of the navy board acquiesced in suffering the impression against them to circulate. No jealousy as to their character was heard of until within these few days. No inquiry to vindicate their fame was proposed or hinted at. Surely they could have brought forward a motion had they felt so sorely as is now pretended. That there might be some parts of the conduct of those commissioners fairly to be found fault with was very possible. But yet, if they were culpable only in a small degree, that was no reason to be alledged against the motion. If, however, it appeared that they dealt unfairly by the characters of men, that was a serious charge; and although it might be proper to continue the commission, most certainly the names should be changed. For it doubtless would be absurd to continue those in power whose conduct had been heretofore exceptionable. The exceptions that were made to the commissioners furnished, if well founded, a reason for excluding them from office; and, if note they could not be urged against the motion before the house. But the right hon. gent. had confessed with perfect candour that he could not vouch for any of the statements that he had made to the house; and surely then he could not ask the house to rely on them as objections to the motion? That those commissioners were ready to go to trial against any or all of the charges that could be alledged against them he had not the least doubt. The charges, such as they were, that the right hon. gent. had stated, could not in any man's mind be deemed applicable in any shape against this motion, in opposition to which, indeed, nothing had been offered, The right hon. gent. had not said, nor could he, that this motion was unnecessary. It was necessary to satisfy the general opinion of the country. It was-called for by public policy. The merit of the men and the gratitude of the people demanded it. In considering the services of those commissioners, the state in which they and lord St. Vincent were placed, was to be taken into account. Much as that noble lord had deserved and obtained by the glo-575rious[...]battles he had fought abroad, be had scarcely in any of them a more difficult task to perform, than in originating this commission, which had to maintain itself in almost every stage of its progress against the operation of power, influence, and authority. With a degree of fortitude and perseverance that would be at any time laudable, but which in their peculiar circumstance, was extraordinary, they pursued delinquency through all the obstructions of high office, and against all the frowns of power; and they succeeded in detecting acid exposing the criminality of one of the principal officers of the crown.", "author_id": "/people/mr-charles-fox-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

If the hon. member who had himself brought forward this business, was content on the night he brought it forward with the small measure of punishment that was mentioned, or rather with the no punishment, it was not competent to him now to go back and argue that a severe punishment should be inflicted for that offence. The hon. gent. took great credit to himself for being so ready to comply with the suggestion of a light punishment; he should also have given equal credit to the conduct of his right hon. friend (Mr. Pitt) on that occasion. Whatever feelings he might have had in bringing the business forward, was best known to himself; but it was most clear that nothing but a sense of duty to the house could have governed the conduct of his hon. friend on that occasion. Whatever might be the motives of the apparent lenity of the very persons who complained of the libel, it was evident that the motive of his right hon. friend (Mr. Pitt) in suggesting a more serious punishment was, that he conceived it due to the character and dignity of the house, and that even when he was himself in a minority, he felt that the decisions of the majority ought to be treated with the highest respect. As to the part of the petition which contained complimentary expressions towards the speaker, although strictly speaking the petitioner was not to be supposed to know that it had been dwelt on as an aggravation of his offence that he had spoken so disrespectfully of a decision which was determined by the casting vote of the speaker, yet he did not suppose that any member could so adhere to strict formality, as to censure the petitioner for merely answering a charge that had been made against him. Although it might, at first sight, appear somewhat ludicrous to hear549the petitioner complimenting the private character of the speaker, yet if that had been left out, and the compliment was only to his situation as presiding over this house, the omission might be complained of with more reason, and would appear to convey something of a reflection on his private character. He wished, however, now, that the editors of papers in general, not only those who conducted daily, but those who published weekly papers, should take notice, and receive warning that a great change had taken place in the system of forbearance that had hitherto been adhered to. Justice, impartial justice, must be done on both sides. A new &#x00E6;ra had now begun, and if any general clamour should be raised with respect to the abridgment of the liberty of the press, it must be recollected by the house and the country, on which side of the house these prosecutions first commenced, and who it was who began them. As the petitioner had defended, with mistaken zeal, the man who had been the victim of the anger of that house, was it unfair for him, in extenuation, to shew the causes which had produced that zeal which drew upon him the displeasure of that house? It was certainly fair in him to point out the reason why he entertained so great a partiality for lord Melville; to state the services which that noble lord, and those with whom he acted, had rendered to the country; and it was not extraordinary, or unnatural, that any member of the community, who felt strongly that the salvation of the country, and the protection that he enjoyed in common with all his fellow subjects, was owing to the salutary laws which were then enacted to be strongly impressed with gratitude for those services, and to undertake zealously, although imprudently, and perhaps presumptuously, to defend a person whom the house had condemned. As to the merits of lord Melville in those times to which the petition alludes, no resolution of the house of commons could erase that page from the history of the country, or from the recollection of the supporters of the constitution. He again repeated, that a great change had now taken place, and that the house and the country must recollect on which side of the house it had begun.", "author_id": "/people/mr-george-canning", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1805", "may", "02"], "content": "said, that although it was peculiarly disagreeable to him to mix in any debate, when his partiality even to the excesss of liberty for the press would interfere with the opinion he would otherwise have formed, yet, on the present occasion, he550could not give a silent vote; nor was the to be deterred from giving his opinion by the indecent threat that had been thrown out by the hon. gent. who had spoken last. That gentleman had stated pretty strongly, that it was in the contemplation of his friends to curtail and abridge the liberty of the press, and wished to have it supposed that he and his friends were to be responsible for the determination on the other side of the house to abridge the real liberty of the press. He saw nothing inconsistent in the conduct of his hon. friend, (Mr. Grey) on a former night with his conduct to-night. He had on a former night given way to that disposition for lenity which he perceived to have been then the prevailing sentiment in the house; but when he now found this disposition towards lenity had been abused, and that the stile of the petition shewed strongly the spirit in which the libel had been written, there was no inconsistency in thinking that this lenity had been misplaced, and that some severer punishment should now take place. He confessed that he himself had used the words stated by the hon. gent. and although he gave his opinion that the paragraph alluded to was a very gross libel, yet he called it milk and water comparatively with others which had not yet been noticed. However, he must confess that some bounds ought to be set to the licentiousness of the press; yet when he considered in whose hands the pruning-knife was to be placed, to lop off its exuberances, he was much afraid they would destroy the pith and vital sap of the tree. On this ground he had hitherto opposed all those measures for restricting the freedom of the press; he had opposed all the increase of duties on those smaller publications which might at a cheap rate disseminate general and useful information; he had opposed the bill which required a printer's name to be inserted on every hand-bill; but above all, he had opposed that infamous act (if he might be allowed to call any thing infamous that was still in the statute book), which allowed magistrates and courts to transport persons to Botany Bay upon the second conviction for a libel. Upon the present occasion he had himself been applied to by some friends of the petitioner, and waited on him in consequence. Having read his petition, he entreated him to leave out those passages, and struck his pen across them. It appeared, however, that after he had seen him, the petitioner took the advice of some other persons, and re-inserted those passages. Af-551ter having done so, he had, however, the decency not to ask him to present his petition. The right hon. gent. (Mr. Pitt) had considered it as a fair set-off in the petitioner to state the former services of lord Melville; if that was any argument, why did not his lordship's defenders in the house make use of it? When the petitioner chose to state that they sat there as a parliament owing to the exertions of lord Melville and his friends, was that language which the house could endure? If it was owing to so lutary laws, surely it was to the legislature and not to one or two individuals, that those laws were owing. It was equally objectionable in a petition to speak of either the merits or demerits of any of the parties in parliament. If a person under punishment for a libel on the character of the house should have taken another ground, and in stead of attributing the safety of the state to lord Melville and his colleagues, had attributed it solety to the firm stand which the opposition in parliament had made to all the fabricated plots and conspiracies which had been invented on the part of government, for the purpose of preserving ministers it power and office, such a statement would have been equally objectionable. A petition ought not to be so framed as to revive those topics of discussion which were no relative to the matter before the house.

There were two solutions of it. In the first place, his hon. friend (Mr. Grey) had complained of a libel; the house unanimously agreed that it was a gross libel; and, under these circumstances, it was not surprising that his hon. friend (Mr. Grey) should, as usual, feel a greater disposition to lenity than the right hon. gent. (Mr. Pitt). If the fact, however, was, that it was one of the minority of the 8th of April, who both wrote that libel and drew up the petition, it was not extraordinary that that hon. member should warmly defend his own productions. The set-off in this case is curious. The editor, who is punished for libelling the majority of the house, tells you, in his vindication, that he has very frequently libelled the minority. Was it to be endured, that an editor of a newspaper should tell the house of commons that he had sat in judgment upon them and their proceedings, and pronounced his applause or his censure on the different parties in parliament as he thought fit? This set-off stated, that lord Melville had been an old and faithful servant of the crown. It had, however, been proved, that for more than 16 years of the time he was in office, he had been an unfaithful servant; and that the principal object of him and his colleagues was to cling to office as long as they could. As to the party heats which prevailed at those times, they were in a great measure gone and obliterated from the page of history, The right hon. gent. himself (Mr. Pitt) had, if there was any faith in man, proposed and recommended his hon. friend (Mr. Fox) as a fit person to hold a high office in the government of the country; and, therefore, he could not have supposed that he deserved those scandalous libels which had been thrown out against his character.

{"date": ["1805", "may", "02"], "content": "rose to reply. He trusted the house would give him credit for having acted fairly, in the manner in which he brought forward the motion. It was, he would confess, a subject of regret to him, that he had inserted the word \"whole\" in his motion; and particularly so, as it had met with objections from a quarter for which he entertained the highest respect. It was not without mature consideration that he worded his motion in that comprehensive way. His reason was, that difficulties of the most extraordinary nature were, at every instant, interposed between those gentlemen and the arduous duty in which they were employed, and he therefore thought no acknowledgment to them could be too strong. When they were encountered at every step by all the acts and subterfuges of that corruption which they were appointed to detect, it was the duty of the house, whose ministers they were, to mark their approbation of their conduct, and their determination to support them in the most comprehensive and emphatic manner. When an hon. gent. rises and declares in his place, that the person who was the heart and germ of that commission was unfit to be continued as a member of it, it was high time indeed for that house to step forward for his protection. It was upon that ground that he inserted thewholewhole in his motion; and that he proposed that the thanks of the house should be extended to the commissioners in as general a way as it could possibly be. He wished to tell them what he, and he was persuaded a great majority of the country, felt towards them for their unabated perseverance and industry. He endeavoured to mark, in as strong a manner as his powers, of expression could command, the obligations he owed them for their ability, diligence, andfortitude(that word he would not have spared) in pursuing the arduous and disgusting task which was imposed upon them. Their conduct in it was well entitled to the praise of fortitude, a virtue which admitted of being as fairly exercised in the pursuit and detection of abuses, as in those situations to which, in its ordinary acceptation, it was generally applied. He wished to convey to those gentlemen the thanks of585the house for their conduct in pursuing the enquiry, for the firmness they had manifested in prosecuting it against all the obstacles which guilt, and fraud, and avarice, had erected to obstruct them; there was no occasion to have read all the reports to estimate the merit in that part of their duty: it was sufficient to know that they met with opposition from every quarter; and that, notwithstanding, they persevered and succeeded, and that the result of their labours was before the house and the country, exciting the admiration and gratitude of both. He had also another motive for wording his Motion in the way he did. He wished to compel the right hon. gent. on the opposite bench, to state to the house precisely and positively why he objected to the conduct of the commissioners of naval enquiry? He had done so; he had stated them candidly and temperately, (he was happy to avail himself of the few opportunities the right hon. gent. afforded him of commending him); and after all what did they amount to? one of the most important was, that they charged a jury that it had been tampered with; that was no new charge. He recollected its having been brought forward by an hon. baronet (sir W. Elford) before, who threatened to make it the subject of a motion in that house, but who was finally obliged to give it up, because he could get no one to second his motion. Another hon. member (sir A. Hammond) had complained of reflections which had been thrown out in one of the reports, against that board of which he was the head. It was full twenty-two months since that report was made; and why, he would ask, did the hon. baronet acquiesce, during all that time under those imputations? Was it that he was deterred by the rebuke which he is said to have received from earl St. Vincent, or that he looked forward to another proceeding which was going on (he meant the commission for examining into the civil affairs of the naval department) for satisfaction and justification? He was much misinformed as to the nature of that new commission, if it was to act as a committee of revision, to controul and annul the decisions of a commission appointed by the joint authority of both houses of parliament, and accountable only to them. He could not conceive, that it could even have been intended to degrade a commission so constituted, by subjecting their labours to he criticised and reversed by a committee of placemen. Did the hon. member decline doing early justice to his586character, because he expected it from a committee who had no power to do it? Another rt. hon. member (Mr. Rose) had also brought forward his charge. Why did not the house hear of it before? Why were his feelings so long silent with respect to his constituent and friend Mr. Taylor, who, it seems, had fallen, by some means, under the censure of the commission? What prevented him from making it the subject of complaint before this night? nothing but his delicacy he supposed. It was really too much, when the noble lord who proposed that commission professed himself ready to meet every charge which could be made against him, that he, as well as the members of that commission, should be assailed from so many quarters. When a member has the indiscretion, to say no worse of it, to rise in his place, and unblushingly proclaim, that earl St. Vincent was the worst lord of the admiralty that had ever appeared at the head of the naval department the country, it was the duty of the house to mark their reprobation of the sentiment. Was it fitting, he would call upon the house to de dare, that the noble lord should be attacked in that vile way ? Was it just that his honour, he would say the honour of the country (for the honour of that noble lord was a part, and a prowl part, of the glory and the honour of the country) should be thus struck at and wounded in that base and inglorious manner? The blow, which was apparently directed against the commissioners of naval enquiry, was in truth, and in fact, levelled at that noble lord. The commissioners had a claim upon the gratitude and protection of the house. While they were hunting down corruption and peculation, and pursuing them through all their foul and secret retreats and lurking places, they were entitled to all the encouragement which the legislature could hold out to them. He should be sorry that the motion he proposed should occasion any diversity of opinion; he wished to meet the feelings of the house. He would he sorry that any division should arise on a motion, which he had hoped would have been almost unanimously acceded to, but he could not consent to abandon the wordwholein the manner proposed.

{"date": ["1805", "may", "02"], "content": "said he had no wish to procrastinate this debate, but he could not help taking notice of what had been said by some gentlemen to-night of the necessity of the house availing itself of the power of punishing its accuser, and insisting that the petition ought to be withdrawn, and that the petitioner should present another. He was astonished at a good deal of what he had heard on this occasion. He thought that this power of the house ought to be reserved till great occasions called for it, where the offence to the house was serious and deliberate, and not as in this case the effect of haste and mere inadvertence. He had observed some gentlemen very forward in calling themselves the advocates of the liberty of the press, but in their actions they had added to the restraint of it. He alluded to the case of Mr. Reeves, when a certain publication of his had been charged to be a libel upon the constitution of the country, and it was referred to the consideration of a committee of the house of commons; that committee examined a great deal of evidence on the subject, and admitted much under the head of evidence which a court of justice would not have received; and afterwards the hon. gent. made a motion for punishing the author by the authority of the house itself&#x2014;thus blending two characters, which ought to be united as seldom as possible, that of accuser and judge. Not that he meant that such a thing should never take place, for there might be circumstances in which even that would be unavoidable, but he was sure it ought to be rarely done. This author, however, was sent with his book to a court of justice, where he was tried and acquitted by a jury of his country, and the hon. gent. opposite to him, who had so repeatedly boasted of his attachment to the trial by jury as well as the liberty of the press, had quoted this case on a former night, as a reason for not sending such cases to be tried by jury. With none of these principles did he agree. He was so far from thinking that the power the house possessed of being both accuser and judge was a reason why they should themselves punish any one who offended it, that he thought it a reason of itself why the house should be extremely tender of adopting that course. Gentlemen had opposed the bringing of this petitioner to the bar on this occasion, and had been pleased to say that he should561be at liberty to present another petition. This, he confessed, appeared to him to spewing very indifferent attachment to one of the best principles of our constitution, perfect and tender regard to that sacred right of the subject on which the redress o the so materially depended, he mean the right of petitioning. He knew of no constitution principle by which that house should reject any petition which was not worded in an offensive manner, still less did understand the principle on which the house should dictate to any petitioner the form in which he should frame his petition. There could be but little freedom where the party petitioned should dictate the form in which the petition should he drawn. All petitions which were not disrespectful to the house were regular, and which the house, therefore, ought to receive. He believed that in this petition there was not single sentence, word, or syllable, which reflected on the house, or on any part of it. It alluded to certain societies which formerly existed in this country, and to the efforts which certain members of the house made to counteract the machinations of such societies. Why should that give any offence to any members of that house? Were there any gentlemen the house who wished to identify themselves with those societies? How they could feel themselves uneasy under this allusion was what he was at a loss to comprehend, and until now the house had not been called in this case to exercise either its vengeance its anger.", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-sturges-bourne", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

{"date": ["1805", "may", "10"], "content": "rose, and addressed the house as follows:&#x2014;My lords, I was anxious that your lordships should hear this petition read through previous to my offering any observations on the subject of it, both on account of the many weighty arguments which it contains in favour of that which the petitioners humbly pray your lordships for, as well as for the strain of loyalty which pervades it, and the respectful, moderate, and temperate language in which those arguments and that prayer are couched. When the petition was first presented, I expressed an earnest hope, and such seemed to be the wish of all your lordships, that whatever opinions individual peers may entertain upon the subject, that the matter of the petition should be temperately, dispassionately, and impartially discussed. I was then happy to perceive such a temper and such an understanding, prevail; and I now beg leave again to express my most anxious wish, that this night the important subject and652considerations to which I shall have the honour to call your lordships' most serious attention, may be temperately, dispassionately, and impartially discussed. Such, my lords, is my anxious wish, and such, I am persuaded, is the earnest wish and prayer of the petitioners themselves. They have felt the operation of party violence and party heat. They know, that from party violence and party heat they have much to fear, and certainly nothing to hope; and if, on this occasion, they look with confidence to better hopes and brighter prospects, it is because they are confident they address a body of men in whose minds party heat and party violence will not be suffered to have the smallest influence.&#x2014;With respect to myself, allow me, my lords, to assure you, that I know myself to be utterly incapable of the wickedness (for wickedness it would be) of speaking with party views or feelings, while discussing the interests, nay, the rights of millions of British subjects, and on a topic on which the peace and unanimity of the empire may eventually depend. I might venture to appeal to your lordships, and to every man who hears me, whether, if this were a question likely to conduce to views of such a nature, or if the individual who is addressing you could suffer party views to influence his conduct, all those motives which usually operate on men's minds, would not lead to a line of conduct precisely different. The person who undertakes to bring this great question before you, is well aware that he has to encounter numerous and powerful enemies; that he must subject himself to much prejudice, much clamour, and much misrepresentation; and that he must incur the imputation of indifference, perhaps of hostility, to the civil and religious establishments of the country; establishments, the security and perpetuation of which are the dearest objects of his heart. All these difficulties he must encounter; and in return what has he to expect? The satisfaction of having discharged a great public duty, namely, that of bringing before your lordships a great and national question, and the consciousness that, whatever may happen hereafter, he will not have to reproach himself with any of the evils which may result from the rejection of the petition, if rejection should be its fate.&#x2014;This, my lords, is not all that I have to remark upon this part of the subject. I consider that it will be a great evil and misfortune653to the empire if the prayer of this petition is not granted; but that misfortune I hold as bearing no comparison in extent with the mischiefs which inevitably must have ensued, if no opportunity had been allowed for a fair and full discussion of this momentous question. It will, I am sure, be respectfully entertained and deliberately discussed. The question will be placed on such grounds, that, whatever the decision of this night may be, no man will go away without the fullest conviction that the day cannot be far distant when the great and important objects of the petition will be attained. But, my lords, if instead of laying it before parliament, those who brought it forward had gone back and told those from whom they had received it, that there could not be found one individual ready and willing to present their petition; that not only the voice of parliament was against them, but that the doors of parliament were shut to their complaints&#x2014;if such had unhappily been the case, I ask every considerate and temperate man, what must have been the impression on the minds of that body on whose behalf I am addressing you&#x2014;what other impression could there possibly have been, but that of absolute despair? What would it have been short of shewing the great majority of the people of Ireland, that all the expectations which were held out to them by the union were to be completely frustrated? The effect which has been produced on their minds by receiving their petition is, that they are convinced they will have an impartial parliament, worked upon by no local prejudices, to consider their wishes with all the attention due to so numerous and respectable a class of our fellow-subjects. I have said thus much in order to vindicate myself, and explain the reasons why I am clearly of opinion, that this petition, if rejected, would have been attended with the most fatal consequences; and also to vindicate the petitioners themselves, for the solicitude they have expressed, that their petition may be respectfully submitted to your lordships' consideration.&#x2014;And now, my lords, how shall I begin to lay before you this grave, extensive, and most important question? My lords, I would begin with that which is the system, the fact, and foundation of the whole proceeding, but which, simply and plainly, appears to me hardly to have made the least impression on the minds of those who are averse to the petition; I654mean the fact, that you have, in the united kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, a population consisting of 3 million according to the lowest, and of 5 million according to the highest computation, of fellow subjects, who have been brought up and educated in the catholic religion, who profess that religion, who are attached to it, and whom therefore you must consider, for every purpose of government, as persons to be treated as Roman catholics. When this question is brought before you, you are not to consider it as we in this country are apt to look at the Roman catholics, as a body of men, however respectable, small in number, and forming only an exception to the general mass of population; but you are to consider, that in that part of the united kingdom called Ireland, three-fourths of the population are of the description of Roman catholics; that it is impossible for you, in taking any one single step towards providing for the exigencies of government, the happiness of the people, or the various matters committed to the legislature, ever to lose sight of the fact that three-fourths of the people of Ireland are Roman catholics, and must be provided for as Roman catholics. If I am asked, whether, supposing a man could regulate the thing by a wish, it would be desirable that the unity which we have established in government should prevail in matters of faith? I have no hesitation in saying, that it would be a happy thing indeed it we were all united in our religious as well as in our political and constitutional opinions. But we are to consider the question not as we wish it, but as it is, as it has been since the revolution, and as it is likely to continue beyond any period of legislation we can contemplate. This being the case, I hope there is no man who, merely because he wishes there was not this body, flatters himself that he may shut his eyes to the population of three-fourths of the country, and content himself with saying, \"I will provide for that which belongs to the protestants, but I will take no cognizance of the other larger proportion of the population.\" I hope no man entertains such an opinion. If he does, I wish him to cast his eyes back to any period of the history of this country, and to point out what moment there was in which the distinction of religious faith, as it regarded the concerns of the large population of catholics, did not form, I will not say a leading circumstance, but the leading circumstance in the situation of the country; and655I would ask him, whether he thinks it would be possible to carry on the legislation of the country, if parliament should shut its eyes to that which constitutes the leading circumstance and feature of the country. That parliament has always acted upon this distinction of religious faith, is a fact which I will not detail by long historical narration, because I take it for granted that your lordships have a full knowledge of the subject. It will be abundantly sufficient if I refer your lordships to what, since the revolution down to the present reign, and from the present reign to the present moment, has been the system. At the period of the revolution,this great mass of the population of Ireland was unhappily connected with political opinions adverse to the principles of the revolution. I believe I may state, without any deviation from the truth of history, that from the concurrence of circumstances familiar to all your lordships, the catholic opinions were at that time intimately blended with political opinions adverse to the government of the protestant interest. A great difficulty arose out of this fact to those who wished to maintain the relations between Great Britain and Ireland. It was not to punish religious opinions, not to put down religious opinions, not even because the catholic religion, as such, implied particular civil opinions in church and state, but it was because those opinions were connected with opinions favourable to the exiled family, that it was found expedient to exclude the catholics from certain objects of participation in the constitution and government of the country. I conceive it is not necessary for me to arraign the policy of the measure. Whether it was expedient, depended on local circumstances, of which it would be difficult to judge at this distance of time; but this at least we know, that the situation of that day, is not the situation of this day. In justice to the memory of one of the greatest princes that ever existed on the face of the globe, and one of the warmest friends of liberty and toleration, let me say, that it is not to the memory of king William that we must attribute the measures that were taken afterwards. We may confidently say, they were measures forming no part of any system that could have obtained his approbation or concurrence. In a subsequent reign the system was this: an opinion was maintained that the catholics of Ireland, merely because they were catholics, must con-656tinue the irreconcileable enemies of the protestant establishment of Ireland, and the protestant government of England. That no kindness, no protection, no lapse of time, no community of interest, no intercourse, nothing could reconcile the eternal hostility of the catholics to the government of this country. Upon that assumption, incapable of proof by argument, the next principle adopted was this, that it was therefore necessary, not only to exclude Roman catholics from all participation in the government, and from all share in the constitution, but that they were not to be allowed even any influence, because influence led to power; not to be allowed to acquire any property, because property led to influence; not to enjoy the free toleration of religion, or the ordinary rights of marriage; not to be permitted to have the least intercourse with one set of the king's subjects. Means were devised by penalties, proscriptions, and disabilities, to drive the whole catholic population from the island, or to reduce them to the state of a poor, ignorant, illiterate peasantry. Such was the principle; and, as it has been said by a great man, never was a system more admirably calculated to produce the object it had in view. The effect of it was, that those who were deprived of the benefit of education were kept in entire ignorance; those who were excluded from acquiring property were left to languish in extreme poverty; those who were persecuted, oppressed, and excluded from intercourse with their fellow-subjects, became altogether alienated from society; and, in proportion, their minds were exasperated against their oppressors. If I could entertain the smallest question as to the impression on your lordships' minds by this statement; if I had the least doubt of the detestation with which every individual in the country considers such a system, I should perhaps have avoided stating the fact. I state it for this reason, because it enables me to exhibit the pleasing contrast of the measures adopted during the period of his present majesty's reign. I speak now of the period in which his majesty found 3 or 4 millions of his subjects in the state I have described. I desire your lordships to consider what has been the conduct of his majesty's government, what has been the object, and what has been the consequence it has produced. I would desire you to consider the striking contrast afforded by the better system of657policy during the present day; a system of gradual amelioration, by measures which have been the more effectual because they have been gradual; measures which, by their mildness, have reversed the whole of the former system. It is perhaps hardly to be credited, that it was necessary, in the reign of the sovereign under whom we live, to pass an act to enable the Roman catholics to intermarry with the rest of his majesty's subjects. You have given them a full toleration, and the benefits of education; you have taken away those odious measures which produced the disunion, of families; you have restored the industry of the country, by granting to the people a participation in the soil, and by allowing them to share in its benefits; you have extended to them all the advantages they are entitled to, except one, the most important of any you have given them, the exercise of the elective franchise and a share in the executive administration. You have done this, and the result has taken place which the measures were calculated to produce. By degrees the wealth of Ireland has extended itself. Few countries, if we except the calamitous period of the rebellion, ever in so short a time made such improvement in agriculture, commerce, wealth, and general civilization. When you gave this encouragement to agriculture in Ireland, and adopted measures to increase the prosperity of the country, you were aware that the augmentation of wealth would first shew itself in the lower and middling classes of society. As the country advanced in wealth the people derived a greater share of influence, and you found it necessary to give them some share in the constitution. By the magnanimity of Great Britain, you acknowledged the right of an independent government. This state of things brought you to the year 1792, when, by a measure which every one will reflect on with pride and satisfaction, you at last extended to the catholics of Ireland a participation of all the privileges of British subjects, with the exception of those referred to in the petition. You gave them the privilege of voting at elections for members of parliament; you allowed them to be appointed to all offices, except the small number mentioned it the act of the Irish parliament. Here then was the fact of a system gradually pursued up to this period; and here, for a time, a stand was made, not, I hope, on the opinion of those who made it, that it was right to take a658fixed stand, and say, we will admit you to these privileges, but from all beyond them we must exclude you. The reason, I apprehend, was entirely different; it was because the system of amelioration had not been sudden but gradual; because experience had shewn you, that denying a privilege at one period did not infer the expediency of denying it at another; because, when adopting measures of such extent, and operating so much on the passions of men, it was necessary to know what you could give without interruption to that harmony, which it was your wish to maintain, in order that it might appear that what was given, large as it was, was granted with a liberal hand, and that the manner of the gift might tend to conciliate the minds of those to whom it was given. Independently of these considerations, there are others of great, I may say, almost decisive weight. I have no difficulty in stating, that they are considerations which make it doubtful whether these privileges could have-been given in the Irish parliament, without the risk of something like a convulsion. In the first place, the parliament of Ireland, particularly the popular part, was constituted, not as ours is, rising up by a concurrence of accidental causes, and producing a just expression of the sense of the country, but it was constituted with the precise object of making the legislature a protestant one, to the exclusion of three-fourths of the population. You know, that when a large addition was made to the representation in the house of commons in Ireland, it was for the purpose, and with a view of rendering it as exclusively protestant as possible. It was a question much agitated, whether, if the right of sitting in the parliament of Ireland was conceded to the catholics, a grant of that nature could be made without leading to consequences which no man would venture to foresee. Another difficulty arose of great moment, which was, that supposing the objections were not so well founded as they were judged to be, or, being well founded, measures had been proposed to remove them without danger or mischief, and that the parliament of Ireland could have been open to the catholic population of the country, it might have probably occurred to enquire, whether such a measure would have been consistent with the interests of Ireland, with reference to this country. I ask not your lordships whether these difficulties ought to659have existed; no man can deny that they did present themselves, and were considered of great weight. It happily is the case at the moment I am addressing you, that by a measure; which, I trust, has rendered the most lasting benefits to the British empire, these difficulties are removed. By the operation of that great measure, the union of the two kingdoms, the objection that arose to the forms of the Irish parliament have no bearing on the representation of the united parliament. The other objection is also removed; because, whatever influence and weight you would have given to the proportion of the catholics over the parliament of Ireland, exactly the same must be given to the proportion of the protestants of the parliament of the united kingdom; therefore you come to the question unfettered by the difficulties which prevented the adoption of the measure before, and, in the opinion of many, would have made it impossible to have carried it into effect in the Irish parliament: however, not only did the union remove these great and important difficulties, but it did two things more, which I trust you will not omit to bear in mind, on considering the motion with which I shall trouble your lordships. It did, in the first place, excite great hopes in the minds of the catholics of Ireland,that, by the operation of the union, they would be relieved from their disabilities. No authorized assurance was ever given; no promise was ever made to the catholics, that such a measure would be the consequence of the union; but, it is no less true, that by the arguments of those who supported the union, by the course of reasoning, in doors and out of doors, hopes were given, that the subject of catholic emancipation would be more favourably considered here than it was ever likely to be in the parliament of Ireland. Those who wished well to the union could not so far betray their trust as not to state, that one of the recommendations of the measure was, that it did seem to afford the only practicable mode of preventing the renewal of the disputes which had produced such calamities in Ireland. It was not, therefore, either from persons authorized, or not authorized to make assurances as to the effect of the union, that the hopes of the catholics were raised; it was from the nature of the subject itself that they entertained, and were justified in entertaining, great and sanguine expectations that the660measure would lead to the consequences so anxiously desired. This assurance was given to the catholics upon the authority of every man who spoke in parliament, whether in or out of office, that if the united parliament was assembled, they would undoubtedly be permitted to present their petition at the bar: that their petition would not only be received, but it would be deliberately considered, and that whatever difficulties had before stood in the way of the accomplishment of their object, it was impossible that the united parliament could refuse to give their utmost attention to the subject, to enter minutely into it, to examine it fully, not by one sweeping vote, but to pursue it in detail, and to investigate all the circumstances respecting the interests, state, and condition of that important part of the population of Ireland. It is this pledge which I now call upon you to renew. It is not now that I am going to call on you to adopt any measure. I shall state what is the measure you ought to take. All I have to propose is, that having now, for the first time since the union, this great body of men coming before you with their petition, you will consider it with temper, and with a sincere desire to do all that lies in your power to compose the animosities of that part of the kingdom, and to render all the subjects of the kingdom happy in the enjoyment of equal privileges, equal rights, and an equal participation of that constitution so justly entitled to universal admiration and respect. The question, therefore, which you will consider, and I shall conclude by moving, is, that the house will resolve itself into a committee, to consider the petition which has been read: and I hope it will not be forgotten, that the motion cannot be negatived, except by those who are ready to say, not only that they are not prepared to go to the full extent, but that they will not enter into the consideration of the question. For my own part, I have no hesitation in saying, that in my opinion, it is highly expedient the whole of what is asked in this petition should be conceded. What the union has imposed upon you is, the duty of providing in the most effectual manner for the real essential union of all the inhabitants of this kingdom, not in government, and policy, and law only, but in interests, in affections, in devotion to the maintenance of the constitution, and in that resolution with which we ought to inspire each other, a resolution to defend the661country against all its enemies. The question is, in my view of the subject, a question of expediency to a certain degree; that is, I do unquestionably hold it to be for the benefit and safety of the whole country, that it should be adopted in cases where the safety of the whole empire requires it: it is incidental to the rights of all legislatures to impose restrictions and disabilities; I have no doubt that such is the fundamental principle of all governments. It was so when the question was agitated in the reign of king William. The question that ought to have been considered in the reign of queen Anne, is the same that now engages your lordships' attention. It is this: Is there any expediency in continuing these restraints by which 4,000,000 of British subjects are deprived of the benefits of the constitution? Now, in this part of the subject I should state what I conceive to be a principle of eternal right and eternal justice, so evident that it is for those who maintain the propriety and expediency of the restrictions, to shew that the necessity exists. The first principle of the British constitution is, that we shall enjoy equal laws; that there shall be no man, however low his situation, who shall not, in point of political liberty, feel himself on a footing with the highest in the country. I repeat, that those who contend for the continuance of any restraint, are bound to shew, not only that it was expedient at the time, but that the expediency continues to exist. This principle I had occasion to state upon a much less important subject, and there was a disposition manifested on the part of some of your lordships to contest it, but it was with infinite pleasure I perceived, when persons of the highest authority rose, that it was impossible for them to state an argument worthy of the slightest attention by those who had the common use of their understanding; in favour of the continuance of restraints on any other ground than that of expediency. If there are persons in this house who are disposed to contend against placing the Roman catholics upon the footing of other subjects, I hope they will tell your lordships what the necessity is for debarring them of their just rights. I should feel warranted in making the motion I mean to conclude with, without any other observation than this; that to my understanding no such necessity or expediency does or can exist; none such has been stated. But I am willing to take the proof upon myself, not that I think it ought to662be imposed upon me, but because I feel such complete conviction, not only that the cause is right, but that it is so manifestly and palpably so, that it is almost unnecessary for me to anticipate the objections which I expect may be urged against it. The principle I take to be, that the British constitution is founded on the basis of equal laws. I admit that there should be some distinctions with regard to privileges enjoyed by different parts of his majesty's subjects; but that such distinctions are to impose restraints on four or five millions of people, and to have the effect of debarring them of their rights, is what I cannot assent to for a moment, without the existence of some strong, manifest, and palpable expediency. The catholics come before you, restricted from the enjoyments of seats in parliament; from the highest offices in the executive government; from the superior offices in the civil, military, and naval professions; from the office of sheriff, and by qualified restraint from offices in corporations. The question is, what is the expediency, the necessity, which should induce you to continue these restraints? The first ground I have heard stated is one which I should be unwilling to attribute to any man; which I should hope could not be entertained by any member, but which I mention, in order to exhaust all the various objections I, have heard or can collect. It has been stated, and I believe written somewhere, that the nature of the catholic religion is such, that no catholic subject can, because he is a catholic, be a loyal subject. If that be true, it will follow, that those persons who profess a religion which makes them traitors are not fit to be admitted into the legislature, or into the highest civil and military offices of the country. I might go further, and ask, whether they were fit to have been admitted to civil offices, with the exception of not more than twenty? Were they fit to have been admitted to the army, to the whole administration of the revenue, with the exception of four or five offices, professing a religion which disqualifies them from their allegiance. Are they fit to come to the table of a court of justice, and swear allegiance to the sovereign? No man who conceives the catholics really disloyal, can agree that they ought to be permitted to come to a country justice to swear to their loyalty. But I have been told, and I know that endeavours are made to circulate the opinion, that it is impos-663sible for any man, who professes the catholic religion, to be a true and loyal subject. Upon this point, one is disposed to look a little beyond mere assertion. I wish to look to the proof. I find it in something that somebody has brushed up from some old musty record, or some old decree of the church. I find arguments drawn against the declarations of individuals now existing, against their whole course of life, not from any thing they profess, not from any thing they believe they profess, but because persons chase to say, \"If you are a Roman catholic, it is in vain for you to call yourself loyal; I know your religion better than you do yourself; you think you do not hold it your duty not to keep peace with heretics, but I know you do; you think too, that you do not hold the doctrine of the dispensing power of the Pope; but it is in vain you tell me so, I know such is your opinion.\" I should hope. my lords, that for any purpose of legislation, you would think it incumbent on you to take the religion of these persons from their own construction, and not from the construction of their enemies&#x2014;that you would take then own conduct as the proof of their loyalty and not condemn them by the tenets, or doctrines, or conduct of some individuals at some remote period. I know not where the duty of persecution is to end. If you are not content to judge men by their conduct, you at least ought not to judge them for acts of which they are not guilty. If it is true that no catholic can be a loyal subject because of the council of Lateran of Constance, or some decretal order of the church&#x2014;if it be true, that every man professing himself a catholic wishes to dethrone the monarch who governs him, in that case I desire you to consider what that goes to. It goes to this, that you not only cannot make the concession demanded of you now, but that you cannot at any time hereafter. Nay more, you must recal every concession you have made, unless you are ready to begin a crusade, to drive out of the country every one of those persons you think its irreconcileable enemies. Against such a principle, one knows not how to argue. If it was possible to bring forward any thing like argument, I should think myself pretty well warranted in opposing it with what was actual practice Is it true, that, in any country professing the Roman Catholic Religion, even at Rome, a man is bound by his religion to prosecute heretics? If it was true that664catholics were actuated by any such sentiments, sure I am, that none of your lordships could have visited the capital of arts on the continent, or have set foot on the southern countries of Europe.&#x2014;The next point on which I shall address a few observations is, that the mass of the people of Ireland are disloyal. If that could be proved to the extent the fact existed in king William's reign, I should allow that the same reasons for imposing the restraints would justify their continuance. How shall I argue that the mass of the people of Ireland are not disloyal? One way I can argue, is by desiring you to turn to the state of Ireland&#x2014;to the acts of the legislature, consisting of protestants. See what they say of the catholics, of whom it is asserted that they are at this moment irreconcileably disloyal I could desire the clerk to read, not one or two, but repeated declarations by the parliament of Ireland, that the concessions of government were granted to the uniform good conduct and loyalty of the people of Ireland. I know I may be told that this was true up to the last rebellion in Ireland, and that the mass of the people continue tainted with the principles of that rebellion. That is only an assertion. It can continue only as such; for there is no demonstration that the rebellion in Ireland was more or less of a catholic rebellion. There never was any thing more unjust, or unjustifiable, than to attribute the rebellion in Ireland to the catholic body. In the first place, down to the year of the rebellion, what had beer their conduct? Before that time there had not been any thing of open rebellion it Ireland, but there had been in the empire two separate rebellions for placing the exiled family on the throne. Look to history&#x2014;look to the acts of your government at the time, and you will be told, that, during both these rebellions, the demeanour of the Roman catholics of Ireland though the object was to create a Roman catholic king, was as loyal as possible During the American war there were periods when the enemy triumphed in the channel, possessed a superior force, and threatened the invasion of the kingdom; at that time the catholics were not only loyal, but they were esteemed as such, and trusted with arm[...]for the purpose of repelling the common enemy. I speak it the hearing of persons who have successively filled the office of lord lieutenant of Ireland, and secretary to the lord lieute-665nant. I ask any of them to rise and declare at what period of our history it was, when the catholic body, as a body, appeared disaffected, either to the established government or the constitution. If down to the period of the last rebellion they were uniformly loyal, it is no slight circumstance that the rebellion in Ireland arose not from religion, but other circumstances. What is notorious to every man is, that in the whole of the conspiracy we see the arrangement of the leaders was composed, not of catholics exclusively, but of men called united Irishmen, which was a name given to mark an union of different sects. The next fact is, that among the leaders of the rebellion it is notorious, that though there were many catholics, there were also many protestants. In the insurrection, the principal leaders were not catholics, but protestants. It will not be thought, that because I told you there were protestant persons in the rebellion, it was therefore a protestant rebellion. I mentioned it to shew you, that the rebellion took its rise from causes different from religion&#x2014;that it pointed at a different object&#x2014;that if it had succeeded, the catholic religion would have been overthrown equally with the protestant religion. The object was not the overthrow of either, but of the monarchical government of England. Many striking instances may be found of protestants who embarked in that rebellion with as much zeal and personal hazard as any catholic. If, then, there is no ground for the imputation of the late rebellion&#x2014;if the circumstances since, instead of furnishing grounds of charge against the catholics, furnish a refutation of them&#x2014;if we are told, that in Ireland three-fourths of the catholics are more quiet, tranquil, and loyally disposed towards the monarch of this throne, than they have been for years past, surely it is as fair to give the catholics all the advantage of their present character for loyalty, as to charge them with the guilt of rebels. Upon both these points, how does the question stand? You have the disclaimer of the catholics of those odious principles. You have the strongest of all evidence, their own positive, public, repeated declarations. I know that there has been a fashion to have recourse to the old exploded doctrines, that there is something in the catholics, that, let them say what they will, they are not to be believed on their oaths, because there is a power acknowledged in666their religion capable of dispensing with that sacred obligation, and of relieving them from the guilt of perjury. It would be useless to shew to what length this argument would go. If it is true that 4,000,000 of persons cannot be bound by any oath, the consequence must be, that the civil government of Ireland cannot longer exist&#x2014;the people are disqualified from enjoying any civil government. One need not go to extremes to prove that this is not a very happy argument on the part of those who assert the proposition of the necessity of enforcing the restrictions. The restrictions are enforced by an oath&#x2014;the catholics are excluded because they will not take the oath of supremacy.&#x2014;What! if they are not worthy of being believed on oath&#x2014;if that solemnity can be dispensed with by the Pope, is it to be supposed that they would hesitate to take an oath to qualify themselves for situations which will enable them to subvert the government of the country, and make the Pope lord paramount? The argument is conclusive&#x2014;if they are not fit to be believed on oath, the test is worth nothing. I am endeavouring to anticipate every objection. It has been mentioned to me, that although this petition contains a disclaimer of all the doctrines attributed to the catholics, yet that the petitioners are all laymen, and that you are to infer, because no clergyman has signed, that the doctrines protested against are held by the priests. The argument would not be good for anything if it was true; but I am desired to state, that the only reason why no clerical person has subscribed his name to the petition is, because it refers to civil rights only; they judged that their interference would be an intrusion. Not only are they willing to join in the disclaimer, but I have it by the records of the country, by the certificates of courts of law, that these respectable men have all of them taken the oaths, and subscribed the declaration.&#x2014;One other only argument on this point of the subject. It is a prospective argument. If it is not true that every catholic is a traitor, yet it is said that the time is coming when every catholic must be a traitor, because the Pope has gone to Paris to crown Bonapart&#x00E9;. It is supposed, that if the Pope has gone to Paris, and Bonapart&#x00E9; has received the crown from him, it must follow that the catholics of Ireland are subjects of the Pope, and are transferred to France. Such trivial arguments would be unworthy667of a grave,assembly, if it was not that, by such absurdities, attempts were made to revive the animosities of the two religions, to extend them to this country, and, as if this was not mischief enough, to make the cry of popery the means of disposing the foolish and ignorant to deny the claims of justice to their fellow-subjects. Can any man believe that the Pope is more connected with France now than at the time of the Bourbons, or when the pretender was at Rome? Is it believed that he is more actuated by a wish to extend the power of France than at any former period? Quite the contrary. I hope there is no man who has not viewed with pity the humiliating and degraded situation in which that person is placed. If he possesses feelings, they must be the feelings of deep mortification, and of disgust at those who imposed the disgraceful task upon him. What is the inference, but that the power of the Pope is less&#x2014;that his respect is less&#x2014;that he is more degraded, and less to be feared, than any person who ever filled the chair of Rome, supposing it possible to impute to him any hostile intention towards this country? So far from feeling apprehensions at the Pope's journey to Paris, it is a transaction that exhibits him no longer as a priest, but as a person forced to expose himself and his religion, in performing a disgraceful ceremony. There have been periods when the Pope of Rome favoured the interests of France; but you never found it excited rebellion in Ireland. You find the pretender supported by Rome, and yet that was the very time when the interest of his family in Ireland declined. In the present state of the affairs of Europe the influence of the Pope never can be attended with any serious consequences. If, instead of all this, every one of the propositions I have contradicted was true&#x2014;if the catholic religion had a tendency to make its professors disloyal&#x2014;if they were disloyal, and in connection with the French, I should then say the necessity that existed for repealing the restrictions was only the stronger&#x2014;that it would the more become you to exert yourselves to contract that disposition by every measure of conciliation and harmony that could be devised. I should say, that the true allies of Bonapart&#x00E9; in Ireland would not be the catholic religion, but those who were endeavouring, and had endeavoured to excite and revive animosities, which had composed themselves and would gradually668compose themselves, and leave the country in a tranquil state. To argue the question with regard to the dissenters, I cannot on this occasion. It is said, that if the restrictions are taken off the catholics, it will be necessary to repeal the test act. It would be a most absurd thing to say, because you grant a right to the catholics, you are therefore bound to grant an indulgence to the dissenters. Whether the dissenters have a right to the indulgence, I cannot say, but I am sure that nothing can be more unjust than that the catholics should be deprived of their rights, because others are judged by you not entitled to any indulgence. There never was a proposition more shocking, or unfit to be argued. If, instead of having shewn you that there is no foundation for the dangers apprehended, the fact was otherwise, let me ask you whether the present system would not augment them? I will admit that the catholics are as radically disloyal as they are represented, and then I come to the question,&#x2014;What is the line of conduct to be adopted? Shall 4,000,000 of persons entertain an irreconcileable hatred to your establishment? There are two different lines of conduct to be adopted; the one is that which was pursued by Queen Anne&#x2014;the other the line which has distinguished the present reign. If their dispositions are such that you know they will exercise power to your destruction, your conduct must be like that of Queen Anne&#x2014; you must take the power from them&#x2014;you must take from them property, and the means of acquiring it: but I conceive that the wiser system would be endeavours to conciliate them. Has the system of restraint any tendency to ameliorate their condition? Can any thing have a worse tendency than to tell them that you distrust their loyalty? If such a system will neither conciliate the higher or the lower orders, can it have the effect you wish? If there be any force in the opinion that you ought to refuse to enter into the consideration of this petition, it can arise from this circumstance only, that we are arrived at the point where it is necessary to make a stand, and concede no more. I doubt whether it would be prudent for the legislature to say, we will now tie up our hands. Whatever system is adopted by the legislature, ought to be on principles immutable, and containing lines of distinction so clearly marked, that no man can mistake their tendency or operation.669Now, let me ask, whether the point on which these laws stand is of this description? You have conceded to the catholics all the civil rights necessary to fill all offices, with the exception of seats in parliament, and the heads of professions. If there is any disaffection among the catholics, it is among the lowest orders; and your remedy is, to exclude those persons from that share of respect which you could give them. I should think that sound policy ought to be the reverse. If you confide in the higher orders, you ought to give them power and consideration; and if,you are obliged to impose restraints, impose them on those whose dispositions you distrust. Does any man believe that there would be less practical advantages from not excluding three or four peers, of whom we may state that we do not distrust their loyalty, but also that they have given as signal proofs as any men in his majesty's dominion, of their zeal and good conduct? If they came into this house, do you believe they would persuade you to abolish the hierarchy of this country? Would you be afraid of their influence going into the house of commons? Few can be so ignorant as not to perceive what little benefit the cause of the Catholics would derive there. Supposing even 50 catholics obtain seats in the house of commons, could they persuade them to overturn the protestant government? The same sort of observations were urged at the time of the union between Scotland and England. There were not wanting persons who told you, that by admitting the Scotch members you would overturn the hierarchy of the church of England. You have had for a century sixteen peers, and forty-five commoners in the house of commons, and I ask your lordships, not whether they have overturned the church of England, nor whether they have overturned the monarchy, but whether you can point out a single instance of a Scotch peer or commoner, who ever dreamt of such a thing as Putting the church of Scotland, so adverse to bishops, in place of the episcopalian establishment of the English church? Surely, then, we ought not, on such grounds, to adopt a measure tending to throw so humiliating a stigma on a respectable class of subjects. I have seen every one of the offices of government filled by persons who may be presumed to have had a presbyterian education. I have seen your predecessor on the woolsack, the chief justice of the king's bench and common670pleas, the chief baron of the exchequer, a master of the rolls, the president of the council, besides generals and admirals, all of whom have been presbyterians, and yet have filled their offices with advantage to the country. I have seen every one of these offices, so filled, and yet I have never observed, on the part of the persons filling hem, the least disposition to change the form of the existing government. It has been said in this house that the consequence of entertaining the petition of the catholics would be, that you would have a protestant king in England, and a popish judge in Ireland. It has also been said, that, admitting it to be true that the catholics cannot overturn the established government, why are they so pertinaciously desirous of obtaining offices of public trust and confidence? I answer, that it is, because there is no proposition of more force than this; that although between individual and individual, the argument does not apply, yet between nation and nation, or between a nation and an individual, it is not true that what the one gains, the other loses. It is not true, with reference to this question, that what the subject gains, the government loses. Though the thing granted is of no value to you, it is of infinite advantage to those on whom it is bestowed. It is worth nothing to you to keep, but it is of the utmost importance to them to acquire. Let me desire your lordships to consider, what is the course of every,liberal profession of life. Is any one at a loss to know, how much importance the student of law derives from the exalted, situation of the noble lord on the woolsack? Is there any man in the navy, who does not look forward to the probable attainment of the ranks, and honours, bestowed, on a Howe or a Nelson? The condition of every man, who is a free inhabitant of this country, is exalted by the consideration, that there is no one who walks the streets, whatever his situation may be, who, with the exception of those to whom these restraints apply, may not arrive by industry, talent, and perseverance, to the highest ranks in society. To these who are so excepted, we can never say&#x2014;I pede fausto Grandia laturus fortun&#x00E6; pr&#x00E6;mia.It is this principle, which teaches the people of this country, to feel a sympathy is the dignities bestowed on those above them. They are sensible, that however low their own condition may be, they are entitled to671aspire to the same advantages. But I should like to know, a law was to pass that the students of the. Middle Temple should be eligible to the office of lord chancellor, and that those of the Inner Temple should be excluded, whether their condition and consequence would be the same Go into the army, and the argument is precisely similar. Look at an equal number of subalterns. To one it shall be said, shew courage, discipline, steadiness, every thing that can animate a soldier, yet there is one thing attached to your situation, you never can rise to that rank in the army, which, will enable you to make yourself a name to posterity; you never can obtain that which is the greatest incentive to the display of valour. The loss is not in the equal privation of an advantage; for it may happen that no subaltern officer may become a general, no student become a chancellor. The degradation consists in the deprivation; and therefore this, which is little for you to give, is much for the catholics to obtain. If your desire is, that there should exist an idea of equal law in Ireland, how can it exist so long as the people say, \"It is not myself, but the law, that imposes this disqualification; because the law says I am a person whose loyalty cannot be trusted.\" Then I ask you, what hope there is for a country, whose religious animosities are thus excited? The memory of former contests can never be extinguished, so long as you continue a degrading system of exclusion, pointed at one class of subjects. These, my lords, are the reasons why I wish you to give way. I am perfectly persuaded, that, trifling as the privation appears in your eyes, it is not inconsiderable in theirs. I conceive, that not a little advantage would result in this and other parliaments, from having representatives known to be of their own persuasion. If they had such persons to represent them, however few they might be, they would feel, that whatever their complaints were, whether real or unfounded, they would be attended to. They would feel more confidence, than when they are told, that you have shut your doors against every person of their community; and that you will not suffer any person of their description to enter the threshold of the legislature, because he holds religious opinions injurious to the safety of the state. What other conclusions can they draw, but that their religious and civil opinions are deemed injurious to the state? And if they feel that they are so distrusted by you, what672can follow but suspicion and distrust on their side also? This, my lords, is the great and leading principle, which actuated my mind in the resolution to submit these observations to your better judgment; and it will ever be my happiness to reflect on the attention with which you have heard me. The object of the motion I mean to conclude with, is that which must be the object of every man who hears me, of every good citizen,&#x2014;the uniting and knitting together the hearts and minds of all descriptions of men&#x2014;that for which you daily entreat a blessing from Heaven on your councils. It is in that persuasion I ask of you no immediate, or specific grant, because I am not prepared to say what other measures, healing, and salutary, ought to accompany the adoption of my motion. Many there are, but this is not the fit occasion for stating them; all I now ask of you is, not to shut your eyes, but to go into a committee, to consider that which never has been considered as one united subject in parliament, I mean the state and condition of Ireland, the leading feature of which is the religious restrictions of its people. It has long been my wish, to have an opportunity of stating their grievances to your lordships. When I found that the people of Ireland grew impatient at your neglect&#x2014;when I found that no step was taken to redeem the pledge given them by the union, I was decidedly of opinion, that all the best interests of the British Empire required that the subject should be brought into discussion. It was their desire it should now be brought forward. I think the season, highly favourable. There is every motive for endeavouring to preserve that necessary part of the empire: you are called upon by every principle of self-defence, to close your ranks, and unite your whole force in order to oppose an enemy, whose power you have so much reason to contemplate with awe. There is this further argument in favour of the question&#x2014;that it is not called for by tumult, but by the good conduct of the catholics. I was not sorry,for the opportunity of stating my own sentiments. I felt honoured by being desired to put myself forward, and I can only add, that I should feel happy if, in the manner of discharging my duty towards them, I have done their cause no prejudice. I conclude by moving, \"that the house do now resolve itself into a committee of the whole house, to take this petition into consideration.\"", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-grenville", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},
{"date": ["1805", "may", "10"], "content": "&#x2014;My lords; after the determination expressed by the noble baron who has just spoken, to treat the subject with all the temper and moderation which properly belonged to it; I can only regret that he seemed, so early in his speech, to forget the recommendation with which he set out. The question, he said, would and must be carried, if not on this night, at least at no very distant period. This was holding out something like a menace to the house, calculated to defeat that temper and moderation, which the noble lord himself had begun by recommending.", "author_id": "/people/mr-robert-jenkinson", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},

{"date": ["1805", "may", "10"], "content": "then proceeded: I certainly understood the noble lord to have used those terms in the sense which I have affixed to them: but if the noble baron only means that his cause must ultimately triumph by the force of reason and argument, I am equally ready to meet him upon that ground. In opening the business, the noble baron has not thought proper to explain to us distinctly the object of his motion for referring the petition to a committee. From the whole train of his reasoning, however, we cannot be at a loss to perceive that he does not propose to confine himself to the partial measure of remedying the complaints of the petitioners; but that his argument goes to the full extent of repealing and abrogating all the tests at present subsisting in every part of the empire. I trust your lordships are fully sensible of the magnitude and importance of such a proposition; I trust you will pause before you give any countenance to the first step of a proceeding which may lead to loch alarming consequences. whatever difference of opinion I may entertain as to the merits of this petition, I have deprecated its being brought forward at the present moment: and I have great satisfaction in feeling, that, differing as I do, on this part of the subject, from some persons, whose vote this will be dictated by the some general principles as my own, no efforts have been omitted by me to prevent this question from being674agitated under the present circumstances. Similar exertions for the same purpose have been made by my noble friend who is at the head of the government of Ireland: but as all our exertions have proved ineffectual, as the Catholics have been advised to press forward their claims on the attention of parliament at this particular period contrary to their own interests, and, as I think, to a just consideration of what is due to the tranquillity of the empire; I feel it to be a duty to have no reserve upon the subject. I owe it to the country, to this house, to the petitioners, and to myself, to state distinctly my opinion on every part of this question; an opinion not hastily formed, but the result of some years' consideration; an opinion founded on the most accurate observation, and the most diligent enquiry I have been able to make upon the subject: and though I certainly think the present time peculiarly unfavourable for its agitation; though I am of opinion that the circumstances growing out of that time, would of themselves furnish a sufficient ground for resisting the proposition of the noble lord; yet my objection rests not on the time only, but is applicable to any time and to any circumstances under which this subject can be brought forward.&#x2014;In stating this opinion to your lordships, it would be contrary to all the feelings I have ever entertained, and all the sentiments I have ever expressed, if I could be supposed to be influenced by any motives of passion or prejudice towards the individuals who are principally the subject of this night's debate. In this view, many of the principles laid down by the noble lord would not he applicable to me, or to any of those who act under similar impressions. It has ever been my opinion, that toleration should be extended to all classes of religionists, and to all sectaries. It was a question much agitated about a century ago, by certain speculative writers, whether the evils which would result from the prevalence of infidelity, or from the influence of religious superstition and enthusiasm, would be likely to be the most destructive of the happiness of society? This question, if ever it was a problem, has been solved within our own experience, We have lived to see a republic of atheists established, for a time, in the very heart of Europe: we have witnessed the desolation which they have occasioned, and experienced, in part, the evils which they have produced. We must he sensible that the bigo[...]ry, intolerance, persecution, and cruelty675of the Most condemned systems of superstition and enthusiasm, are as clemency, moderation, and mercy, when compared with the same qualities in the atheists of France. With such an example before our eyes, we can no longer hesitate in believing that those who possess any religion, be it what it may, are to be preferred, both as men and subjects, to those who have none. Every class of religious persons, in this view, deserves the support, the toleration, and protection of a rational government; and of the different descriptions of christians, the catholics are not those in whom I have the least confidence; nor can I agree in any of the suspicions which may have been entertained, that the catholics are incapable of becoming loyal and dutiful subjects. I am convinced that many of the odious tenets ascribed to them have never been substantially, and, in fact, believed by them. I know by experience, both by their conduct in this country during the most critical times, by their conduct in Canada and in many other parts of the world, that they have proved themselves on many occasions most loyal and excellent subjects even to a protestant sovereign. But the question we have this night to consider, does not relate to their it situation as subjects; we are deliberating upon a claim to political power. Civil liberty should be denied to no man, except upon the strongest reasons; civil rights ought not to be abridged, except upon the most urgent necessity: but the principle which ought to influence the distribution of political power, is not only not the same, but is in some respects the very reverse of that which ought to operate upon civil liberty. With regard to the one, the presumption is always against all restraint; with regard to the other, however wise it may be to extend it, it should always be extended with that degree of jealousy and circumspection which may enable us to guard against the abuse of it, and which may prevent its being made the instrument to destroy the support it was alone created.&#x2014;I am ready to admit, that no laws can be considered as perpetual, and that there must exist in every sate a power somewhere, to revise, to modify, and even to abrogate the laws of the state, according as circumstances may render it necessary: but it has been the practice of every wise government to adopt certain elementary and fundamental laws, which might become a kind of landmark between the governors676and the governed, and which though they be made the subject of revision and even of alteration, should not be changed, except on the strongest grounds, and on the most urgent necessity. The principles of the revolution, as established by the bill of right and act of settlement, have always been considered as of this description. It is one of the fundamental principles of these laws, that the king must the church of England. The conduct of our ancestors at the revolution, has been a subject of admiration to all wise men and true patriots. The persons who brought about that glorious event, were sensible all the advantages of hereditary monarchy; they determined to depart no further from the strict line of succession, than the necessity of the case and the nature of the circumstances rendered indispensible: but in their prospective settlement of the constitution, as well as in their remedy of existing grievances, they had the courage and fortitude to consider the situation of the country in all its different contingencies; they put the question to themselves, whether the inconvenience arising from having a king of a religion different from that which was established in the country, or the evil of breaking in upon the order of succession, were the greater: and, with all their attachment to hereditary monarchy, they determined that it was more expedient to break in upon the line of consequences which might result from having a sovereign of a religion different from having a sovereign of a religion different from that of the country. This law was not founded upon speculative principles, nor decreed from any idea of imaginary grievances; but was the result of experience, and grew out of the evils which had been actually felt under a king who was of a religion hostile to that which was established in the state. Now, I say, it follows as a necessary consequence of the limitation of the crown to persons of the established religion, that the same principle should apply to the immediate advisers, counsellors, and officers of the crown,&#x2014;to those who are in some instances actually the delegates of the crown, and who must act in its name and by its authority. There may be shades of opinion as to the extent to which it may be expedient to apply this principle; but that it is true to a certain extent, and in a certain degree, must appear incontrovertible: for what could be more preposterous than, in a government of677law, where the law is above the crown, to compel the king, under the pain of forfelture, to be of the established church, and to allow the ministers, the chancellor, the judges of the land, to be of any religion the most hostile to the establishment? If we were reasoning ab initio, the converse of this doctrine, I could conceive, might be maintained with much plausibility; I could understand its being contended, that any infringement upon the line of succession in an hereditary government was so serious an evil, and might be productive of such calamitous consequences, that it might be more expedient to incur the inconvenience of a king of a different religion from the religion of the country, rather than expose ourselves to all the evils which might arise from the possibility of a disputed succession; and that our security ought therefore to depend not upon the limitation of the crown in this respect, but upon a limitation against all those who hold the principal situations of trust and power under the crown: but it is impossible to conceive how the idea can be ever be entertained, that were the hereditary principle is in question, you will actually violate it, rather than suffer a prince to sit upon the throne, who is of a religion different from that of the state; and yet, where the hereditary principle does not interfere, nor any other principle which can in any degree be at variance with what is due to the security of the establishment, that you will suffer the servants of the crown to be of a religion the most hostile to that of the state, though their being so must be productive of as many and even more practical inconveniences than could arise from the king himself being in the same situation. The limitation of the crown, therefore, with regard to religion, would seem necessarily to lead to the limitation of the advisers and counsellors of the crown; and the principle with respect to the first could never be maintained, unless it were likewise extended to the latter.&#x2014;In point of fact, the history of our constitution establishes the truth of this very course of reasoning. When, at the restoration, apprehensions and jealousies were entertained both of the presbyterians and catholics, parliament began by passing against the corporation act, principally directed against the former. They afterwards passed the test act, principally directed against the latter; no limitation then existing or being adopted with respect to the crown itself: and when the Duke of York publicly avowed his conversion to the roman catholic religion,678and a bill was in consequence introduced into parliament with a view of excluding him from the throne; it was professed by those who successfully opposed that bill, that they would agree to any limitation on the exercise of the power of the crown, though they would not consent to break in on the course of succession. The king made a declaration conformable to the same principles, the exclusion bill was rejected by this house, and it was not till after the country had the experience of the evils arising from a catholic king, that, in the future settlement of the constitution and the throne, the same limitation was extended to the crown with regard to religion, which had been previously imposed on the great officers of the crown, and on the members of the both houses of parliament.&#x2014;The adoption, therefore, of this principle with respect to the latter, was antecedent, in point of time, to the adoption of it with respect to the former; the importance of the limitation, in this instance, for the security of our establishment, appears to have been judged to be at the least natural and essential as in the case of the crown itself; and the objections which were felt to apply to such a limitation on the crown were considered truly as in no degree applying to a limitation on the offices of the crown.&#x2014;I come now to consider what might be practical effects of a removal of all these limitations and restrictions which our ancestors have adopted for the security of the constitution. These restrictions apply both to the diss[...]ters and the catholics, but to the latter in a much more extensive degree than to the former. It may be material, therefore, in this distinction. There are certainly some classes of protestant dissenters who differ from the church of England, on matters of doctrine, as widely as the roman catholic; there are some who differ even more widely on the subject of hierarchy and church government: but there is this important distinction between protestant dissenters of every description and roman catholics; the former admit that all ecclesiastical matters may be the subject of internal regulation; they acknowledge no foreign jurisdiction, they pay no foreign allegiance: the catholics, on the contrary, acknowledge a jurisdiction in a foreign power. I am aware that this jurisdiction is stated to be confined to spiritual and ecclesiastical matters: but it must be obvious to every person who has679considered, the subject that it is impossible, in many cases, to separate civil from ecclesiastical power. In the catholic religion, above all others, the jurisdiction and authority of the priesthood interfere in a great part of the civil and domestic, concerns of life. Let any person reflect how large a proportion of the property and civil rights of individuals must depend on the legality and validity of marriage; yet on this subject the opinions and practice of the catholics differ essentially from those of the established church. They consider marriage as contract to be entered upon, in many cases, under different conditions and in different circumstances from those which are prescribed: by the laws of the country, and, when completed, to be incapable of dissolution, on any account, by. any human authority. The power to whom they appeal, on all those subjects where there is ground for doubt, is a foreign power, wholly unconnected with, and in a greater or less degree necessarily hostile to, the state. Can there then be any doubt of the importance and solidity of the distinction between the roman catholics and all other classes of christians? Their obedience to a foreign jurisdiction forms an additional feature in their dissent, from the establishment to that of all other christians, and renders additional guards ,against them indispensable: but I say with respect to all descriptions of dissenters; would you intrust the patron age of the church, in its most important branches, to persons who consder your establishment heretical or idolatrous? Are you desirous of seeing the administration of justice in the hands of those whose religious opinions are in the most essential particulars, directly at variance with the law of the land? Would you be satisfied, that the office holden by my noble and learned friend on the woolsack should be conferred on a person of a religion hostile to that of the state? Remember, that, if religion does really operate upon the mind of man, it must operate far beyond all human considerations; that no pious man will prefer his temporal to: his spiritual concerns; that, it the religion and the state are distinct and at variance, and he is compelled to decide between theme, he must decide for his religion, and against the state. It is not because I believe the catholics to be bad men, it is because I believe them to be honest and sincere, that I would exclude them from that power, which they might use for our: own destruction. It cannot too often be repeated that the question before us is not whether the catholics may be loyal subjects; not680whether they should enjoy toleration; or obtain civil rights or civil liberty; but whether you will grant to them political power of every description, at the time when they refuse to acknowledge the complete authority of the state. Whenever this question has been discussed without doors, the only answer have ever heard made to it is that, as long as we had a protestant king, there could be no probability of any of the offices in question being filled by any except protestants: but, I ask, where is the security for this? where, but in the laws which it is proposed to abrogate? And if this were the case, what is the boon sought for; and why is there any eagerness to attain it? It would be to deceive both catholics and dissenters, if we should repeal these laws as a favour, and then refuse them the advantages which they have sought for and expected in their. repeal. If the safety of the state requires a barrier; let that barrier be the law, and let us have courage and firmness enough both to avow it and to maintain it.&#x2014;The question relative to the admission of catholics parliament, stands, admit, in some respects, upon different grounds from that of their admission into the great offices of state. The members of the legislature are not compelled by the law to hold communion with the church of England: and, powerful as each branch of the legislature is in itself, the personal power of the individuals who compose it is very different from the personal power of those who hold the great offices of state, or who belong to the council of the sovereign. But though the legislature has not enacted the same tests for the members of the legislature, as for the officers of state; it has enacted some tests, and those of a nature very important. It has enacted for this purpose, an oath of abjuration of the pretender; a test which at this time of day may not be considered as very essential, but which no class of christians has any objection to take. It has enacted a declartion against transubstantiation, and other popish articles of faith; a declaration most necessary at the time it was adopted, but which might be stated, perhaps with some degree of plausibility, to be a mere doctrinal test, and, though applicable to doctrines which are at variance with the religious opinions of the established church, not more so than many of the sentiments of certain classes of dissenters: but it has enacted the oath of supremacy and I appeal to all considerate men, whether, as long as the catholics refuse to take that oath, it oath, it could be safe681to admit there into the two houses of parliament. I desire it may be considered, what is the purport of the oath of supremacy: it does not call upon individuals even to declare his majesty head of the church, as he is by law; It calls upon them only to abjure all foreign dominion and jurisdiction; and as long as the catholics decline taking this oath, could it be consistent with the security of the state, to consider them as competent members of the legislature of a protestant and independent country? But in addition to these considerations, arising out of the importance of the tests themselves, particularly the latter, I am convinced it would be highly inexpedient for the interest of Ireland to repeal these tests, and thereby enable Roman catholics to become members of the legislature. In the first place, it would not satify them; and I should consider, that to add to their political power by means which would not satisfy them, would be the greatest degree of imprudence. In the second place, though it might benefit a few individuals; instead of being advantageous, it would be highly injurious the great mass of the population of Ireland. In the year 1793, the elective franchise in the counties was granted to the Roman catholics of Ireland. This was considered at the time to be a great boon to them, not so much on account of the political power which it bestowed upon them, as because it placed the catholic tenantry upon the same footing with the protestant tenantry, and afforded therefore to landlords the same inducements to favour and conciliate the one as the other. The practical effect of it has, however, been to produce in the counties of Ireland something approaching very near to universal suffrage; as the law stands at present. No great inconvenience is, however, felt from this circumstance; they can vote only for a protestant candidate; and, the great mass of property being in the hands of the protestants, the tenantry, according to the natural order of society, will generally follow their landlords. But I know it is the opinion of some of the persons best informed of the internal state of Ireland, that, if the doors of parliament were once thrown open to catholics, if catholics could once declare themselves as candidates in the different counties, the influence of the priests would be exerted in favour of the catholic candidates as such, and certainly against the protestants. The result would be, that the influence of property would be operating on682one side, and that of religion on the other. Such a state of things would not only produce much internal confusion find disorder, but it would operate most injuriously with respect to the lower orders of the people, who would unavoidably, in many instances and on many occasions, become the victims of these conflicting interests. I am therefore clearly of opinion than, upon general principles, it is to the highest degree inexpedient to relax any of those laws which have been enacted for the security of the establishments of the country. The noble lord has stated, that he could not see any thing in the present times which could render it inexpedient to grant the prayer of the petition. As to this point, my lords, I view the subject very differently from the noble lord; I consider the circumstances to be so materially changed since the years 1800 and 1801, as to absolve from inconsistency any person who might have been disposed to support the measure at that period, and who may nevertheless be determined to oppose it in the present instance. The French revolution, as I have already stated to you, was founded in part on atheism; It was calculated to occasion new and great dangers to Europe; the cause of civil society was at that time naturally and justly considered to be the cause of all religions, against those who had none. The circumstances of the moment induced many persons to feel an indifference respecting he subject of all former contests. To a certain degree, this change in our policy might be not only natural, but wise:&#x2014;but, as it repeatedly happens, in our exertions to avert the present danger, we were not at all times sufficiently considerate of the past, nor so attentive we ought to have been to the future. However this may be, we have witnessed a greet change in Europe within the last four years;&#x2014;the extreme of democracy has given place, as in the end it naturally must, to the most arbitrary power which was ever erected in any country; and the person possessing that power, has judged it prudent to reconcile himself to the pope, and to the church of Rome, as a support and assistance to his authority. Whoever considers the extent of the power of France at the present moment; whoever reflects, that almost all catholic Europe, with the exception of the dominions of Austria, is in subjection to France; whoever contemplates the absolute dependence of the pope on the will of France, and, what never happened in any former period, that there is at pre-683sent no counter balance whatever at Rome to the influence of that power; whoever gives due weight to the considerations arising out of the nature of the connection subsisting between the catholics of Ireland and the pope, and will attend to the circumstance that the catholic church of Ireland is under the controul and superintendance of a college of cardinals at Rome; must be convinced, that there never was a moment more unfavourable for augmenting their political power. On every sound principle of reasoning, this could not be considered as a proper time for bringing forward such a claim. Those who do not agree with me in objection to the measure on principle, should nevertheless wait for the result of the contest in which we are engaged; they should feel that this was the time, of all others, when it would be peculiarly hazardous to part with any share of that power which, once parted with, it might never be possible to resume, and which, if abused, it might be beyond our own power to remedy. I come now to the consideration of the practical advantages which would be likely to arise from these measures; and I cannot but feel, that we are called upon to sacrifice our laws for a benefit to a few individuals, but which would be likely to afford no advantage whatever to the great mass of the catholic population of Ireland. Every thing in that country has already been conceded to the catholics, which can interest the great body of the people. They enjoy the right of admission into all offices, civil and military; the right of franchise in their respective countries; and, in short, every right and privilege enjoyed by their fellow-subjects, with the exception of about thirty-eight of the first offices of state, and the administration into the two houses of parliament. Can we, then, really believe that they feel much anxiety on the subject of what remains to be given? I am fortunately in possession of the sentiments of the some important authorities on this part of the subject. In the year 1798, several of the persons who were under the accusation of high treason, were examined before a committee of the lords and commons of the parliament of Ireland, and were permitted to banish themselves at the time of the peace, on condition of making a full disclosure of all the circumstances within their knowledge, relative to the rebellion. I shall not allude to the evidence of that person, who but a few weeks before had been described to be most virtuous and enlightened of patriots; but who proved himself on that occasion by his own confession to be the684greatest of traitors; I mean Mr. Arthur O'Connor. I am desirous of referring you to the evidence very much his superiours. The 1 st is, Dr. M'Nevin, a physician and a catholic; the 2d, Thomas Addis Emmett, a professed protestant, and a lawyer. My lords; the following question were proposed to Dr. M'Nevin, by the secret committee of the Irish house of lords:&#x2014;Was any ecclesiastical establishment intended by the new government?A. No: I conceive that a revolution would of church establishment, and of course a relief of the poor from tithes.&#x2014;Q. Do you think the mass of the people in the provinces of Leinster, Munster, and Connaught, care the value of this pen, or the drop of ink which it contains, for parliamentary reform or catholic emancipation?A. I am sure they do not: but they wish much to be relieved from the payment of tithes.&#x2014;To Mr. Emmett, the questions, though not so pointedly expressed, were of a similar nature, and the answers are not less deserving attention. Q. Do you think the mass of the people care for catholic emancipation, or parliamentary reform?A. I believe the mass of the people do not care a feather for catholic emancipation; neither did they care for parliamentary reform, till it was explained to them as leading to other object which they looked to, principally the abolition of tithes. They were also taught to consider that, when they became members of a democracy, their condition would be bettered. Q. Was any ecclesiastical government?A. None, certainly.&#x2014;Why then I have a right to infer as well from these authorities, as from the presumption of the thing itself, that, circumstanced as the great body of the Catholics is at this time, they would not consider what you are called upon to grant, as any desirable boon or material concession to them. The noble baron has said that, inacceding to his propositions, we should part with but little, and grant much. My view of the question is totally different; I am of opinion that we should surrender that which would not \"enrichen them, but might might make us poor indeed.\" I believe that what remains to be given is all because if given it might make the catholics the state. I am ready to give them the every thing under the state, but I am not prepared and, I trust, your lordships neither are nor ever will be prepared, to surrender the state685itself into their hands. I have heard it said, since you have given so much, why not relinguish the remainder? I answer, you have hitherto only given them that which, however advantageous and beneficial it may be to them, is little taken from you, whilst you preserve what remains. The objection to your former concessions has been, not to the concessions themselves, but to the future advantage which would be taken of them; and that, were those once granted, they would tend infallibly to the conclusion which is now attempted to be drawn from them. Recollect, that you still hold in your hands the great offices of state and the two houses of parliament, and that therin are vested the power, jurisdiction, and sovereignty of the empire. Be firm in your present situation, and your establishments are safe: but every additional step you take may lead to the vital prejudice of the country. I would now ask, whether, if this measure were conceded, we really believe the Roman catholics would be satisfied, and whether we have any ground of confidence from past experience, that nothing further would be demanded, which it might be indispensible to refuse, and yet which must considerable difficulty and disadvantage. I admit that the petition on your table is drawn up, in general, in moderate terms: but the catholics even there insinuate that they are not very well satisfied with the substituted tests which they are now obliged to take; and when all the remaining restrictions are repealed, I should not be surprised if they demanded a repeal of the very tests, on the condition of taking which they have been hitherto relieved. But is this all? Let me appeal to the history of Ireland within the last few years.&#x2014;In the year 1793, when a noble friend of mine was lord lieutenant of Ireland, the catholics presented a petition, in which they professed specifically to state all their greivances. Some opposition was made to the prayer of this petition by persons of great weight and respectability in Ireland: but, in the end, all that they prayed for was granted. It was not till this had been done, that they stated, in an address of thanks presented to the lord lieutenant, in which they profess their gratitude for what had been accorded to them, that they considered it as a first step only to further favours, and expressed a hope that it would be followed by additional concessions. Is it not important, therefore, to know, by what the pre-686sent concession, if granted, may be followed? Are there no questions behind this which may be brought forward as soon as it is conceded? Attend to the evidence of Dr. M' Nevin and Mr. Emmett. Do they not tell you that, little as the Irish people feel interested in the abolition of tithes? It has been a doctrine advanced within these few years by several persons dissenting from the church establishment, that no person ought to be bound to pay to the church of which he is not a member. This doctrine was adopted by many of the chiefs of the Irish rebellion: and I would ask the house, whether the argument of the noble baron, in favour of the concessions now proposed in consequence of the catholics being so great a majority of the people, might not be afterwards applied, with at least equal plausibility, to the question of their contributing to your church establishment?&#x2014;What would be the consequence? Why; that, in making this concession, you would only change the ground of the contest, and, instead of contending with them on a question on which the great mass of the population cannot have, and have not in point of fact, any material interest whatever, you would have to contend with them upon a point on which all the passions, the prejudices, and the interest of the people would be naturally and easily embarked against you. Believe me, the laws you are desired to repeal, are the outworks of your church establishment. As long as they are preserved, the establishment itself cannot and will not be assailed. Struggle, therefore, for them to the last; and remember that if you are there defeated, the contest is not at an end; you will only change the scene of action, and have to resists the enemy in a situation where his power of attack will be more formidable, and your means of defence much more difficult. The expectation that concessions, as such should lead to peace, is unfortunately contrary to the experience we have had in the history of Ireland. No man can lament, in itself, more than I do, the greater part of the penal code which was enacted against the catholics in the reign of queen Anne: but there is one singular circumstance attendant upon the enactment of that code, and which deserves peculiar attention,&#x2014;Though Ireland, from its first conquest to that period, had, with very small interuptions, been the theatre of rebellion and insurrection, yet from the time of the adoption of that code to the period of its repeal,687during a long series of years, notwithstanding there was a new family upon the throne, possessing a disputed title to the crown; notwithstanding two formidable rebellions in Great-Britain, Ireland remained in a state of repose and tranquillity; it was not till after the policy of concession had been adopted, that disaffection, insurrection, and, ultimately, rebellion, made again their appearance that country. As I never could have approved of the principle of that code, I rejoice at its repeal: but though I approve of the repeal in substance, I doubt very much the wisdom and policy of the mode in which many parts of that repeal were effect; it does not appear to have been effected on any great and consistent system of policy by which the whole state of Ireland was brought under the consideration of government, and future dangers thereby foreseen and provided against, at the time that ancient grievances were removed: but concession seems to have been too often made to clamour, for the purpose of averting the danger of the moment; such concession, led naturally to new demands; such demands, have on some occasions been precipitately complied with; and the consequence has been, that discontent has been fostered and encouraged, and some inconsistencies have be a introduced into the laws of that country, which it is impossible not to regret. Viewing the subject in this light, I cannot agree with the noble baron in attributing so much political wisdom to the gradual manner in which, this instance, these concessions have been made: on the contrary, I discover no small inconvenience and mischief in the very circumstance which is the object of his commendation; I believe that the tranquillity of Ireland would have been better consulted, if, instead of the temporary expedients just described, a mature and steady view had been taken of the whole of its condition; if it had been deliberately enquired, what concessions might have been made without much hazard, and what ought to have been for ever refused: this being ascertained, it would have been the part of a liberal and enlightened policy to grant whatever the safety of the state would have permitted: and there would have been this convenience in such a proceeding, the deliberation with which the concessions would have been made, would have sanctioned the concession themselves. At the same time it would have been a bar to further demands, and we should have been equally, tranquil and equally safe in what we refused and what688we granted. My,lords, the conduct of myself, and of those with Whom I have acted, will prove that we have been at all times friends to a mild and conciliatory exercise of the laws in Ireland: but whilst I state this to have been our opinion and our practice, I must be allowed to say that I have formed a very erroneous judgment of the character of the people of Ireland, if have not learned that that policy which in my judgment is most compatable with mild laws, namely, a steady system of government, is the best chance you can have for the internal peace and tranquility of that country. The maxims which I have adduced in support of our established laws, are neither new in themselves, nor confined to the country in which we have the blessing of being born; they are the maxims and principles which have been hitherto adopted by every free community of Europe, as well in ancient as in modern times. It has been till within these few years a principle uniformly recognized, that the state and the established religion of a country must be connected; and that those who possess political power in the former, owe a certain degree of obedience and homage to the latter. If look to the ancients, I find that, in the republic of Athens, no citizen could take a share in the civil administration, or enter upon any public office before he had taken an oath that he would defend and protect his country and its religion, and that he would conform to then national worship. In the republic of Rome, the great civil and military officers could only be appointed through the concurrent sanction of the established rights;&#x2014;without the due performance of these, the appointments were not good, the parties were said to be vitio creati, and they lost their situations. If I look to modern times, I find that, in the republic of Holland, the principal offices of the state could only be holden by those who professed the established religion of the country. In the government of Poland, (a limited monarchy in principle, however vicious it might be in practice,) the same maxim was entertained and acted upon. Similar principles will be found to have pervaded almost all the free governments of and I know not how I can better sum up what was understood to be the system and practice of Europe in this respect, than in the words of our glorious deliverer, king William; who, when applied to by king James, on the subject of indulgence to the catholics; made, through Mr. Fagel, the following answer: \"Their689highnesses ever had a profound submission to his majesty; but since the matter that was then in hand, related not to the making of new laws, but to the total abrogation of those already made both by king and parliament, their highnesses did not see how it could be expected of them, that they should consent to such an abrogation, to which they had so just an aversion; as being a thing contrary to all the laws and customs of all Christian states, whether protestants or papists, who admitted none to a share in the government or public employments, but those who professed the public and established religion, and endeavoured to secure it against all attempts whatsoever.\" There are, I know, two most important exceptions, in recent times, to this policy: the first is to be found in the conduct of the national assembly of France, who proclaimed the equality of all religions; which was only a prelude to the destruction of every description of religion in that country. The second exception to this principle, is the system of the United States of America. I desire that any person who is disposed to hold out this system as a subject for imitation, would inform himself of the situation of that country; I desire that he would read the accounts of the different persons who have visited it within these few years: What will he learn from these accounts? why; that one of the circumstances that attracts the attention of every stranger who passes through this country, is the apparent indifference, in many parts of it, to all religion; that the public worship appears to be neglected; that the churches are suffered to be in ruin. Can such a state of things exist, and have no effect on the morals, temper, and dispositions of a people? should, then, America in this respect be an example even for a new community? but can she be an example to a country like Great Britain whose pride and glory it has been whose pride and glory, I trust, it ever will be, to exist under a different system, and to have been fostered and supported under different principles. I know that the proposition of the noble baron has the approbation of some of the best and most virtuous of men; I know, however, that some of its most active friends will be found amongst those who have, on the subject of religion, no small degree of insensibility. If religion he necessary for the happiness of mankind, states must be in in earnest about it, as well as individuals. The people of every country will look, and have690a right hon to look, to what their civil governors think, and how their civil governors act If they are zealous, if they are united, it will have a considerable effect in producing the same qualities in the community over which they are placed; if they are lukewarm, if they are divided, what can be expected from the people?&#x2014;It has been said that the laws of Ireland, with regard to the different tests, are not in all respects similar to those of Great Britain; they certainly are not so: in some particulars, the difference arises out of the different circumstances of the two countries, and it may be wise and expedient to have established it in others. However, my own opinion is, that the principal difference has arisen from a want of a due consideration at the time in the parliament of Ireland: but whatever the difference may be, we must take Ireland as we found her at the union. If the independent parliament of Ireland has removed some few restraints which it would have been more prudent on British principles to have continued, we are nevertheless bound in justice and good faith not to re-enact them, unless some strong practical necessity should indispensably require it: but on the same principle I assert, that, if the independent parliament of Ireland antecedent to the union, judged it expedient to continue certain restraints as necessary for the safety of that part of the empire, we are bound likewise in justice and good faith not to repeal them, unless some unforeseen circumstances and great necessity should compel us to have recourse to such a repeal.&#x2014;I have already stated, in a former part of that with which I have troubled you, that I was ready to admit that no laws could be perpetual; but there are certain laws so incorporated with the very existence of a state, that to attempt materially to affect them, may be replete with the greatest danger.&#x2014; I consider the connection which has subsisted between the church establishment and the constitution of this country to be of that nature; let us remember that if the church owes its existence to the protection of the state, the constitution owes not less its existence to the support it has occasionlly, met with from the church. In the reign of Charles the First, the party who meditated and ultimately accomplished the ruin of the monarchy, meditated at the same time, and equa1ly accomplished, the ruin of the church establishment they fell together, and at the restoration they rose again together. In the beginning of the reign to691Charles the Second when the tide ran high in favour of monarchy, the only resistance which was made to that prince for some years, was made by the church party; and to their opposition at that time, we were indebted for the preservation of any part of our political liberties. I come then to the revolution: and let me ask any person acquainted with the history of that period, whether the zeal of the whigs for liberty could have effected it, if they had not been aided, seconded, and abetted by the zeal of the tories for the established church?&#x2014;I call not therefore upon any one of the great parties into which this country has been divided; I call upon them all, for support this night; I call upon the whigs, who have ever gloried in the lead which they took in the revolution of 1688, who have ever considered themselves as the principal promoters of the bill of rights and act of settlement; I call upon them to support the system of King Williams, and the laws enacted under his auspices; I call upon the tories, the firm, steady, and persevering supporters of the monarchy and the established church; I call upon them to maintain those laws which are the bulwarks of these establishments. The question between me and the noble baron, is shortly this;&#x2014;he desires you, for the reasons which he has stated, to repeal your test laws; to repeal your corporation acts; nay, to repeal the bill of rights, and act of settlement, in some of its most important stipulations. I implore you to cherish the laws under which you have lived and prospered, to cling to that policy which, in my conscience I believe, has made you what you are, and under which you have, enjoyed liberty, toleration, wealth, tranquillity beyond whatever was enjoyed by any country on the face of the earth. Avoid rash innovations shun new experiments: the future destiny of our country is not in own hands; kingdoms may rise and fall, flourish or decay; but let us not be ourselves the instruments of that blow which may occasion our destruction; let us not despise the wisdom of our ancestors, nor forget the dangers which they have averted! Let us reflect that all past experience and all authority is in favour of our laws, and that it is only by a steady adherence to that system which we have received from our forefathers, and a firm determination to transmit it to our descendants, that we can hope to exist with credit, or to fall (if we must fall) with honour. Impressed with these considerations; fully convinced that the propo-692sition of the noble lord leads to the repeal of those laws which are the foundation all our happiness, security, and prosperity; satisfied that the advantages which he expects to arise from the repeal of them, would not be gained, and that the best interests of the country would be exposed to the most serious danger; I deprecate his experiment; and I shall therefore give my negative to referring the petition to a committee.", "author_id": "/people/mr-robert-jenkinson", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},
{"date": ["1805", "may", "24"], "content": "as a member of the Paving Board, rejoiced that the time for enquiry had arrived. He agreed that the shameful state of the streets of Dublin required something to be done immediately, but he denied that the Paving Board had been guilty of any misconduct; their crime was their poverty; the expenditure of the corporation greatly exceeded their income; many of the most essential articles in their work had trebly increased in their price, while the taxes remained the same, and without means it was impossible for them to do their duty to the public in the manner that was expected.&#x2014;He approved of the commissioners, but thought they should be appointed in the house of commons, and not by any one out of it, and that their enquiries should extend to the investigation of the grounds upon which the unfavourable report made three years since of the Paving Board by the commissioners of imprest accounts was founded.&#x2014;The noble lord stated also some details proving the inadequacy of the funds of the board to the fulfilment of their contracts. He said, the principal part of the debt had been contracted by the former corporation; the debt incurred by the present board arose from the great increase in the price of every article; oil, for instance, was more than double the price it was, when the board was first instituted, and the sum they paid for cleaning the city had increased from 1600l. to 5000l. a year, and for this they were only allowed 2000la year.

He thought the subject one to which it was highly necessary to call the attention of parliament, as a head of public expenditure, under which there had been no investigation whatever for the last seven or eight years. The disbursement of money by the government of this country, under a similar head, had for a long series of years eluded enquiry: though frequently, proposed, it was often rejected, like many other salutary objects, until at length the perseverance of the house of commons prevailed, and the secret service money37was reduced to public investigation, so far, at least, as it was admissible for a minister to disclose the objects of its application. Rumour had very strongly stated, that within the last few years very large sums of the public money had been disbursed under this head, though by an act of parliament, the sum of secret service money was limited to 5,000l. annually, except in cases for the purposes of suppressing insurrection or rebellion; but when it was known that the pension list of Ireland had doubled, and now amounted to 120,000l. it was high time for parliament to do its duty, by examining into the branch of expenditure to which he alluded. The pension act, by the 9th and 10th section, provided that no more than 5,000l. per annum should be granted by the crown upon that establishment, until the pension list was reduced below a limited sum; but there was no guard against the grants of the lord-lieutenant. The union was a measure which would, no doubt, hereafter lead to many great and important purposes, when the minds of the people should be awakened to its advantages. He did not deny, that the object of his motion was, to make disclosures, which, to some persons, might not be altogether agreeable. It had not been concealed, that a vast sum of money was paid, for the purpose of bringing about the union, which was held out as a measure calculated to produce the most important and beneficial consequences, which, he was sorry to say, were not yet very likely to result from it. Ever since the year 1793, it was notorious that no account Was given to parliament of the disbursements for secret services; and he was sorry a noble lord who had been called upon to refute them was not in his place to wipe off the reproach from himself&#x2014;[a general laugh, lord Castlereagh being in his seat]. He begged the noble lord's pardon, and hoped he would avail himself of being present to clear himself. He hoped that the house would now pay more attention than formerly to the disbursements of Ireland, as the English members were aware, that our country had to defray two-seventeenths of the expences. The expences of some, though not all, of the proportions in Ireland, were now before the house, amounting to the sum of 110,000l. and his motion would be for a secret committee to enquire into that expenditure. On looking into the journals, he found a precedent for his motion, in the reign of William and Mary, Nov. 1688, when a38motion was passed, calling for an account of the money paid for secret services to members of parliament, and was presented by Mr. Secretary Harley, in the December following. As he did not expect to have the right of the public, to know what they actually did pay, disputed, he moved, \"that a secret committee, of 13 members, exclusively of such members as held any public offices at the will of the crown, be appointed to enquire into the disbursements of secret service money in Ireland, from the year 1793, to the end of 1804, inclusive, excepting such sums as may have been paid for the detection of any conspiracies, and distinguishing their respective amounts, and the names and services of the persons to whom they were paid.\"", "author_id": "/people/sir-simon-newport", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

If he thought for a moment that the motion of his noble friend was likely, in the remotest degree, to injure the church or state, he assured the house that there was not a man in the country who would not only more unwilling to support it, but more strenuously oppose it than himself. If he thought that it went to invalidate the principles on which the Brunswick family came to and now possessed the throne, the idea would be abhorrent to his694feelings; but he thought the manner in which his noble friend had opened the speech with which he prefaced it, completely obviated any such apprehension. He perfectly agreed with his noble friend, and the noble secretary of state who followed him, in the propriety of discussing this important question with perfect moderation and temper; but insisted, that this rule of conduct had been infringed by the noble secretary himself, who attributed to his noble friend, and to the petition of the catholics of Ireland, sentiments of defiance and menace, which the fact did not justify. The noble lord had endeavoured to prove, that the Roman catholics of Ireland paid allegiance to a foreign power. He wished to ask the noble lord where he discovered this? It was perfectly new to him. He knew that they considered the pope as their spiritual head, but he was pretty well assured that they did not recognise in him a civil governor. The published opinions of some of the most learned men among the Roman catholics disclaimed that on which, to give a delusive weight to his argument, the noble secretary dwelt with such emphasis. If the fact were true, however, if it were incompatible with the safety of the church and state to allow to the catholics any civil power, why did not the noble lord vote for the committee, not for the purpose of granting to the catholics additional immunities, but to repeal those which they had already received in the present reign, and which, if the arguments of the noble secretary were good for any thing, teemed with danger to the country. The noble lord asserted, that before any concessions had been made to the catholics of Ireland, they were perfectly quiet, but that concession seemed to be the signal with them of turbulence. This was not so. It had been unequivocally proved, that the late rebellions arose entirely from political causes, and had nothing Whatever to do with religious subjects. \"But,\" says the noble lord, \"if you grant this, you will be pressed to grant more.\" Well! it so; if the grounds of any additional grants that might be required were as good as those of the present, they ought to be allowed, and he could not admit the possibility of the noble secretary seemed to wish to insinuate, that the most remote wish would ever be expressed for the establishment of a catholic church, or for allowing the crown to be held by any but a protestant prince. These, indeed, would be infringements on the fundamental laws of the constitution,695which he would be as eager as the noble lord to oppose. The noble lord had laid great stress on the material change which he declared had taken place since 1801, in the consideration of this subject. What had that change been? That the French had again commenced the support of the catholic religion, and consequently that their influence over the professors of it in every nation would be considerable. For his part, he was not disposed to attribute much influence to their intrigues; but allowing them the full force with which the noble lord had clothed them, he would ask, what were the best means to avail themselves of this additional power of making an impression in Ireland? The answer was plain: it was by a well timed concession of indisputable right, to conciliate the affections of the people of Ireland, and thus to unite the whole kingdom in the determination to resist to the utmost of their power, the desperate attacks of their common enemy.", "author_id": "/people/mr-george-spencer-2", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},

Whenever restrictions were to be taken off, it was the duty of those who proposed their removal, to see that it was done with as little inconvenience as possible. As a friend to the principle of the petition, he lamented that the time for introducing it had not been more properly chosen. The introduction of it at present, he feared, would tend to excite religious distinctions, and ultimately to frustrate the great object of the petition. When those who brought it forward, did it without the least prospect of success, their conduct tended to throw it a greater distance than he, friend as he was to the measure, could wish. When he saw it brought forward improperly, and intemperately, he could not feel much inclination to give it that support that he would have done under a different situation of circumstances. Upon those principles700he was disposed to resist it in the first instance. The principle of the petition was not the demand of the people of Ireland. Where were the petitions in favour of it? There were none. It was brought forward by a particular set of persons, for their sole advantage. If the catholics were to be led into political power, he saw no reason why that privilege should be restricted to the catholics of Ireland alone, whose situation under the constitution was much preferable to that of the English catholic.

When he received his majesty's commands to repair to Ireland in year 1795, and found the question of admitting catholics into the legislatures of Ireland, he had thought it his duty to that measure to the utmost of his power, and had great satisfaction in thinking that he resisted it with success, as707he conceived the measure would before the union have been attended with the greatest disadvantage and even danger. When the union between Great Britain and Ireland was happily effected, he confessed he thought he saw a moment when the same objections did not exist, and indeed was of opinion that it would have been expedient, at least, to consider whether such alterations could not be made in that code of laws which imposes disabilities on different classes of his Majesty's subjects, with a view of entering into some general plan, as might, under proper provisions, admit every person complying with those provisions into all the privileges enjoyed by his Majesty's subjects in general, without endangering the present church establishment, and he thought that such participation should have been extended to other sects as well as to the catholics. His lordship expressed his opinion that such a measure might at the above period have been introduced with advantage, steps having previously been taken to conciliate the feelings of the learned professions, the law and the church: circumstances, however, took place, which induced Lord Camden to be convinced that it would not be expedient, at the time alluded to, to take steps even to ascertain if the measure were practicable, and of course that the measure itself could not be introduced with any chance of success. Such was the opinion of those who quitted his Majesty's service in 1801, and till the present moment it has not appeared that any of those persons have felt that the question could be brought forward with propriety; he was, therefore, yet to learn what there was the present situation of affairs which could induce their lordships to consider the present an advantageous period for such a discussion. He was decidedly of opinion that in the present state of the feelings of the country, it was imprudent to agitate the question, for the sake of those very persons who are represented as desirous of having it brought forward. Although he did not see the danger in granting those privileges to the Catholics which some persons did, Yet he was fully persuaded that they could not at the present moment be granted without creating great discontent amongst other classes of dissenters as well as the members of the established church. He therefore deprecated the discussion, but if it must proceed, he had made up to oppose going into a committee, not only upon the grounds before stated, but also as objection to doing so for any of those purposes, which the speech introducing the mo-708tion represented as belonging to the subject, but to which the words of the motion and the general character of the noble lord's (Grenville's)speech did not appear to lean.", "author_id": "/people/mr-john-pratt-3", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},
{"date": ["1805", "may", "10"], "content": "observed that the motion before the house was, in point of form, that the house should resolve mover evidently, and the prayer of the petition expressly was, that the catholics should be admitted to an equal participation of constitutional rights and power on equal terms with the protestants. If this were to be complied with, the constitution of church and state could not, in his judgment, long survive. The catholics professed also their anxiety to be relieved from all tests. This was insinuated in the petition, and it was the language publicly held by the members of that body in Ireland. The house should, in considering this question, recollect, and deeply reflect upon the situation of Ireland. If the demands in the petition were acceded to, the712house could not suppose that the catholics would stop there. No, the catholic hierarchy looked for the domains and revenues of the established clergy, and those must follow the grant of those things for which they now applied. Nay, more, the house would feel it necessary to proceed further, the 5th article of the union must be repealed, and the catholic church established in Ireland, for without this be had no hope that the catholic would be contended, and tranquillity securely established. Until the hierarchy were in possession of that church property which they naturally and anxiously desired, they would not cease to excite discontent, and if they ever obtained that property, perhaps matters would not end there. It was, indeed, most probable that a total separation from this country would be the next object of pursuit. Apprehending such consequences from the proposed concessions, and he could assure the house that such was the prevailing apprehensions among the more intelligent protestants in Ireland, he must deprecate the proposition. The comparison made between the case of Scotland and that of Ireland, he felt to be quite unfounded&#x2014;because the church of the Scotch was the establishment of the country, which remained in quiet obedience to the state of Great Britain, and in perfect harmony with this country. But that any thing like peace or quiet, or harmony, could exist in Ireland while the catholics were subject to such a hierarchy as the present, he thought utterly hopeless. Another difference arose from this, that Scotland was, even if she were hostile to the protestant establishment, by no means equal to Ireland in point of weight and importance in the empire. Besides, the comparisons made, alluded only to persons who sought for places of power and profit in England, and they, it was to be recollected, were obliged to take the sacrament to qualify themselves for such places. The Scotch, therefore, adverted to by the noble mover, became protestants before they were admitted to those high offices he had mentioned. Of course, there was this difference in the two cases&#x2014;that the presbyterians of Scotland were not eligible to those high offices until they took those tests which the catholics claiming those offices refused to take. In the one case there was obviously no danger while in the other every thing was to be apprehended. He would put it to the house whether such a distinction in favour of the catholics would be consistent with commons policy or justice&#x2014;to require of one class of subjects a test of qualifica-713tion, which another, claiming equal privileges, refused to subscribe. He would ask whether such a proceeding could be reconcileable with the principles of policy which governed our ancestors? Between the Roman catholic clergy and laity, the noble lord stated, that there was a very marked distinction. The clergy&#x2014;they were to be considered in quite different points of view. The clergy formed a great compact body, standing in open defiance of the law&#x2014;exercising an authority which the law did not sanction, and considering the protestant clergy as usurpers (here there were marks of disapprobation from the opposition benches). The noble lord resumed, and repeated his last assertion. In support of this assertion he would appeal to any noble lord who was acquainted with Ireland. The catholic clergy, he knew, denominated the learned prelate on the bench above him (the Archbishop of Armagh) simply Dr. Stuart. These clergy always called themselves the regular successors of the ancient bishops of the country. They took their titles, used their insignia, and assumed every thing appertaining to the prelacy that was not prohibited by law. In a petition once presented to the house of commons of Ireland, they put their signatures as regular bishops, and there was only one man in that assembly (Dr. Duigenan).who had the spirit to notice this gross and insulting violation of the law. Such was the state of the catholic hierarchy, that he must deprecate any increase of their power. They already possessed an authority of great extent&#x2014;an authority too, enforced by the most dreadful means&#x2014;that of excommunication. This excommunication was of such a nature that the poor victim whom it denounced, might starve in the street before any catholic would communicate with or instance where a poor person, who had been excommunication would have actually starved, if it had not been for the benevolence of a protestant divine, who supplied him with subsistence. There was another instance of the exercise of this extraordinary power which had come to his knowledge. Two catholics were married by a protestant clergyman. This being heard of by the parish priest, he reported it to the bishop. The persons who had been married were immediately summoned to appear before the catholic vicar-general of the diocese, and the protestant clergyman, consulting the peace of his parish, and perhaps his own safety, with that of the parties summoned, advised them to submit to the714summons. They accordingly waited on the vicar-general, expressed their contrition and readiness to make any submission in their power. But no, the vicar-general was inexorable, and this couple was excommunicated for having been married according to law. But this was not all, such as should have any communication with them, were to be excommunicated also. The man, however, being a person with whom many were in the habit of communicating, it was reported to the bishop, and above 200 persons, men and women, were from 20 miles distance summoned before the vicar-general. They accordingly obeyed, but somehow the vicar was so much appeased as not to impose the excommunication. He however inflicted a penance, which was, that each person should perform a pilgrimage of 30 miles: that is, from what are called Holy Wells, in Ireland, to another, each bearing a label, specifying the cause for which such penance was imposed. Things similar to this frequently happened in Ireland, and such was the fear they inspired, that the influence of the clergy was almost unbounded. They, in fact, assumed an authority much greater than belonged to the catholic clergy in any other country whatever; for their authority was restrained by no law. It was quite without controul. Before the reformation, the power of the catholics was not free from legislative restrictions. There was a remedy against the abuse of ecclesiastical power. But now what was the remedy? An appeal to Rome; and what kind of redress was to be obtained from such an appeal? If any persecuted catholics could or would resort to it, he would leave it to the house to judge. The catholic clergy dissolved marriages on various grounds, not recognized by our laws. They forbid marriages within certain limits of consanguinity, contrary to law. In fact, the legitimacy of children, and of course the succession to property, was made to depend in a great measure on their will. The noble lord proceeded to account for this by stating, that the reformation had never been perfect in Ireland, and that, consequently, the catholic hierarchy still retained extraordinary power. The imperfect progress of the reformation he illustrated by referring to the reigns of Elizabeth, James I. and the Protector. Until the latter period, the catholic bishops, &c; retained many of the ecclesiastical domains. Thus, in consequence of the slow progress of the reformation, the catholic hierarchy still retains a power without law&#x2014;nay, contrary715to law; and they tyrannize over the other catholics. As long as such a body remained in that country, he felt most forcibly that it would be absurd to expect tranquillity or Contentment. There was nothing more remarkable, the noble lord said, than the difference between the catholics of England and Ireland. Having lived in a part of that part of the empire where there were many catholics, he was enabled to speak to this difference. In those parts of England where catholics are resident, if one saw a farmer distinguished for temperance, cleanliness, and industry, it generally turned out that he was a catholic; in Ireland it was directly the reverse. What could be the cause of this difference? He had asked an intelligent English catholic, and the reason stated was this, that catholic clergy in this country studied to promote peace; but those of Ireland found their account in pursuing an opposite course. So, much was he persuaded of the justice of the remark, that the hierarchy was interested, and prone to excite disturbance, that he sincerely lamented that their abolition was necessary to secure peace. Nay more, he was thoroughly satisfied that such an abolition would be highly grateful to the better informed part of the catholics themselves, as it would be for the interest of the whole body. This would be the more readily admitted when he stated that peace and harmony was most to be found in the dioceses where there was no bishop, or where the bishop did not much meddle with the parish priests. That bishops were not essential, or desired by the catholic parish priests, was apparent from the case of Canada. There the priests complained of a bishop's having been sent among them, alleging that harmony prevailed among them until such an authority was placed over them. Having had communication with some intelligent, conscientious parish priests in Ireland, he had reason to know that the hierarchy in its present shape was not agreeable to the people, and was peculiarly disagreeable to the more informed part of the clergy. From those parish priests he learnt that they were afraid to be known to hold any communications with protestants, lest they should incur the censure of their bishops. Indeed this statement was confirmed by a circumstance with respect to Dr. Hussey. A few catholic servants in a protestant family were in the habit of joining in a certain prayer which involved no difference as to any doctrinal point. The practice, however, being reported to Dr. Hussey, he instantly forbid it, stating as a reason that,716although there was nothing intrinsically objectionable in the prayer, \"its being read by a heretic was sufficient.\" And this learned and liberal doctor, who was afterwards connected with that union, which had in view a separation from this country, issued orders to the parish priests of his diocese to guard against such a practice in future. With respect to the character of the higher orders of the Irish catholic laity, they were of two descriptions&#x2014;the one possessed of landed property and old established rank&#x2014;the other were in possession of property also, but were new men. The former were interested in the permanent peace of the country, and among this description of persons, the most distinguished perhaps was a noble lord, whose name was subscribed to the petition on the table (Earl Fingal); that noble lord was a man of good sense, loyalty and extreme moderation, when left to himself. But when he submitted to the advice of the hierarchy, his conduct bore a different appearance. It might be said, that what he had said tended to shew the propriety of going into the proposed committee. But, no; and for this reason, that the changes he recommended in the state of the catholics was not to be effected by legislation; it must come from the catholics themselves. That change produced, many concessions might be made to the catholic body, that it would, under the present circumstances, be extremely unsafe to agree to. Wherever religious establishment should be thought necessary, it was indispensable for its maintenance that political power should attach to it. On the same principle that those who had no property, were excluded from political power, should those who are hostile to the church establishment be excluded from the same description of power&#x2014;namely, that in either case equal power might tempt to the assumption of an unfair claim of an equal division. That the protestant religion was ways deemed essential to the maintenance of the constitution, by our ancestors, the noble lord quoted the case of the king of Sardinia, who was excluded from the throne expressly because he was a catholic. Recurring to the difference between the catholics of England and Ireland, arising from the different constitutions of the hierarchy, the noble lord cited the oath, which was notwithstanding the objection of the apostolical vicar, subscribed by the catholics of England in 1778, while the same oath&#x2014;namely, a test of allegiance to a protestant succession only, was refused by the catholics of Ireland. The acceptance of this path in the one case,717proceeded from the superior information of the men, and the refusal of it in the other from the superior influence of the bishops. Dr. Hussey wrote a pamphlet against this oath, arguing, that it would be monstrous to call on a catholic to swear, that he would not be faithful to a British sovereign, if that\n            sovereign should happen to be of the same religion with himself, and this argument succeeded. The noble lord stated the means by which, in his judgment, the changes desired might be produced in Ireland. If the bible were translated into Irish, he was persuaded that very good effects would follow &#x2014;that many catholics would be converted to the established church. The house would recollect the consequences that arose from the translation of the bible into the Welsh language. The protestant service being read in Ireland, in the English language, which numbers did not understand, was a great impediment to the conversion of catholics. They understood the Latin liturgy much better&#x2014;having it from early education by note. The state of the church in Ireland was, besides, very bad. There were 2,400 parishes in Ireland, the benefices of which were reduced to 1,100; 500 of them only had fixed residences, the remaining 600 had no fixed residences: out of 2,400 parishes there were not many more than 1,000 churches. In many parts of Ireland there were excellent livings, very much sought after, which had neither church nor glebe-house. But if we were to set about ameliorating the condition of Ireland, the only way to do so effectually was to take proper means to propagate the doctrines of the protestant church, and if this were done, he had very little doubt that Ireland would soon wear a different appearance; provided another thing was also done&#x2014;that of providing for the safety of such inhabitants as are protestants; for in a very large portion of Ireland there could hardly be said to exist such a person as a day labourer who was a protestant; no one person of that persuasion could expect to be otherwise than miserably treated by all his neighbours who were catholics. It was true he had the sanction of the law for his profession, but in Ireland the laws were not enforced as they,ought to be; there were many and deplorable defects in Ireland in that particular; and they were chiefly owing to the power and influence :of the catholic hierarchy. It was the interest of that hierarchy (and they pursued that interest) to create. a spirit of animosity in the people of Ireland against the protestants; the consequence was that there718existed among the mass of the people of Ireland, who were such catholics as he had stated, a general hatred against the English name; and an Englishman and an heretic, were with them synonimous terms; so that it was impossible, consistently with the safety of the protestants of Ireland, to grant the prayer of this petition. He would venture to say, that if the prayer of this petition were granted, the result would be, that except in part of the North of Ireland, and perhaps the capital of that country, no protestant would dare to live in it. This he had from information which could not be doubted; for a reverend prelate had told him that he could not keep one protestant servant, and much of this came under his own view. He knew that none of the protestant inhabitants of Dublin, who were parents, could get their children into the service of any considerable family, so that, they were obliged to apprentice them out to handicrafts. Such was was the disposition of the catholics, for whom this extraordinary indulgence was now asked, that none of the protestant children could find employment in the service of any considerable family in Dublin, and this was the case generally all over Ireland. Nor was this all, for no day-labourer could find employment, unless he was a catholic. He considered this proposed measure of what was called relief to the catholics, as a measure so far from being likely to conciliate the people of Ireland, that it would have the effect, if agreed to, of driving out of Ireland all the protestants; for until the present hierarchy of Ireland should be in possession of all the ecclesiastical revenues of Ireland, it was not to be supposed that they would be contented, and having gone so far in asking, if they were successful, it was not to be supposed that they would not go further. In earlier days the catholic religion of Ireland might have been put on the same footing as that of England, and then the hatred to the protestants would not have subsisted as now it does; but they had proceeded on a wrong foundation, and had erred on the system of intolerance in their principles much further than the catholics of England had ever done; they could not now, at least on the sudden, be brought back from those errors into which their hierarchy had led them. We must consider the Roman catholics of Ireland as persons who refused to submit to those laws and principles of reformation which had transformed this country from a catholic to a protestant country. They were now disposed in Ire-719land to resist the laws in that particular, and would continue to do every thing in their power to do so. They must, therefore, be dealt with accordingly, and under such circumstances it would be the greatest madness to put into their hands more political power than they possessed already. He admitted that this was holding out a melancholy prospect, but that he could not help, for it was truth exacted it of him; and although there was much force in the expression, that we ought to pay attention to the feelings of the great body of the people of Ireland who were catholics, yet it did not follow that we were to abandon the interest, and indeed the safety, of the protestants of Ireland, at least until the Roman catholics of Ireland shall put themselves in a different situation from that in which they are at present: until they should know how, like the catholics of England, to ask their priests and teachers, will you permit us to take the same oath as the catholics of England, they could not fairly or safely be trusted with that which the catholics of England enjoyed.&#x2014;When they should be permitted by their priests to take the oaths in like manner as the catholics of England did, they might be put in the same state of independence, they might then be worthy of the benefits they now seek; but as long as they remain slaves to the power to which they are at present slaves, his lordship said, he was of opinion they are not worthy of what is now asked in their behalf.

H. took a view of the progressive increase of the British navy, and of the means that had been adopted for many years past, in different administrations, for keeping up, and for increasing the navy of Great Britain. He had seen mid known of so many instances of waste, and of shameful and flagitious abuse in the. naval department, from persons in comparatively high stations down to those in the lowest, that he had reason to bless the day on winch .his noble friend earl St. Vincent was called to the head of the naval administration of this country. He also spoke in very high terms of praise of the administration of earl Spencer, when at the head of the admiralty. His R. H. next proceeded to praise the exertions of the commissioners of naval enquiry, who had been proposed by the noble earl, and informed the house, that he should, 'very soon after parliament met next session, bring before their lordships' consideration the matters contained in the sixth report, which were of the highest importance to the naval department, in many essential points. It was reported, that the most enormous and flagitious thefts and peculations had been practised in different departments of the navy, and as that report came from au authority which could not be questioned, he thought it peculiarly incumbent on the house to look narrowly into the subject which was now before their consideration. When the immense amount and value of the stores which were annually supplied for the navy were taken into consideration, it was evident that the most enormous and100incalculable abuses might prevail, if those who were at the head of the navy did not discountenance them as much as possible, and endeavour to detect them. In this he thought at least the naval part of those who managed the navy should lend their assistance to the first lord of the admiralty. He thought that his noble friend (earl St. Vincent) when in office, ought to have had the assistance of the navy board, and of the comptroller of the navy. He thought that in time questions respecting the dock-yards, he should at least have had the assistance of the deputy comptroller of the navy, who had himself worked as a shipwright; he, however, had understood that his noble friend had by no means met with that co-operation that he might have expected. He should now consider the question of the building ships for the navy. The royal navy of England now consisted of a tonnage of 530,000 tons, of which, to the honour of this country, 114,000 had been captured from the enemy. Of what remained, no less than 260,000 had been supplied by contract. It would therefore appear, that but a small proportion indeed had been built in the king's yards. The number of shipwrights, however, who were in the king's yards bore a very great proportion to the whole number in the kingdom. In all England the, number of shipwrights were only stated at 5200, and in the king's yards alone, 2800 of them were employed. He could therefore very well suppose, that when the merchant-yards had been able to furnish such a number of ships, the king's yards employing no less than 2800 shipwrights, might easily equip ten sail of the line annually, in addition to the repairs which our ships might want. His majesty's dockyards employed a sufficient number of hands, and if there were not docks and slips enough, it would be easy to make more. It appeared to him that it ought to be in the king's yards that the king's navy should be built. The noble viscount (Melville) had spoken with an air of. triumph of the number of small craft that had been built under his administration, and of the great superiority we had over time enemy's flotilla at Boulogne. He looked upon the flotilla. with great contempt; but if the noble viscount thought it sufficient to appeal to the superiority of our fleet off Boulogne, as a proof of the goodness of his administration of the department of the navy, he should ask, whether that su-101periority was more decided now than it was under the administration of the noble earl ? Could the noble viscount pride himself equally on the protection of the other interests of the empire? Administration had been informed, or they ought to have been informed, that the West Indies was the destination of the enemy's fleets, and yet they left the West Indies without any adequate protection. It was not possible for them to be deceived by the reports we had heard of something going forward between this country and Russia. They had persevered in the system of blockade, but without preventing the enemy's fleet from putting to sea; they had received considerable sums for secret services, without learning any thing about the motions of the enemy, and the Rochefort squadron had been for six weeks triumphant in the West Indies. If the commander of that squadron has done nothing more, if he has not got the absolute possession of the soil and property of our islands, he is deeply responsible to his own government for his weakness or cowardice, for if any English commander did so little with such a superior force, he would probably be called to a most severe account. Had the Toulon fleet sailed on the same destination, Jamaica and the most valuable parts of our West-Indian empire were still in the extremest danger, and yet there was no noble lord, who could pretend to say whether they had not sailed for the West\n            Indies; whether they were now in Cadiz, or whether they had ever returned to that port. His R.H. concluded an able speech in support of the motion, in which, both by general and detailed arguments, he shewed the propriety of earl St. Vincent's conduct, to whom he paid very high eulogiums; and pressed upon the house the justice and the necessity of going into committee of enquiry upon a subject so important to the feelings and character of that noble lord, of the house itself, and of the whole country.", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-hanover", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},
{"date": ["1805", "may", "24"], "content": "professed his disinclination to follow the noble lord, who had made the motion, into all the details which in the course of his speech he had thought it necessary to submit to their lordships. He observed that, although the debate had branched out to a considerable length, the question appeared to him to lie within a narrow compass. It had been alledged that his noble friend (lord Sidmouth) gave the noble earl nothing but fair words, which was unfair; for that noble viscount had certainly taken a line of conduct which was dictated by the sense he entertained of his parliamentary duty, and at the same time had spoken according to his feelings with reference to the character of the noble earl. But his lordship said he recollected that others, on a former occasion, when an enquiry was moved for, had professed great friendship for that noble earl, but had indeed given him nothing but fair words. Having stated this, because the occasion, as it appeared to him, called for it, he should come immediately to the question now before their lordships, which was, whether certain papers already before them should be referred to a committee, and that was a subject, he confessed, of great delicacy, involving considerations of great importance with a view to the disclosure that must attend it if the motion be carried. God forbid, that he should say, if a grave case was made out, the house would not attend to it, and send it to the investigation of a committee, even at the risk of all the consequences which might follow the disclosure; but nothing short of absolute necessity would induce their lordships to do so, for the disclosure would not only be to the people of this country, but must necessarily reach the enemy, and be a disclosure to the whole world; and before their lordships could be prevailed on to do that, they would take care that the ground on which it was called for was imperative upon them ; that they had hardly a choice whether they should go into the enquiry or not; and he would confess freely, that some of the papers referred to were of such a nature, that he was sorry they were asked for at all. The question then came to this, was there any .necessity, or matter sufficiently important laid before the house to induce their lordships to adopt this motion? The principal106points which had been dwelt upon, and which had been most disputed were, on the expediency of building ships in the king's dock-yards, or of having recourse to the aid of merchants' building. He did not feel much confidence in his ability to form a correct opinion upon such a subject; but he believed it would be found the true policy of this country to build as much as possible in the king's dock-yards, but that it was impracticable to build all our shipping there, and that government must have recourse to the assistance of the merchants' yards in that respect. Since then, it was impossible to do altogether without that help, the question reduced itself a considerable degree; and he would then ask, whether what had been done in this respect called for the enquiry of a committee? The subject was of considerable difficulty, as a question to what degree government should contract with merchants for building ships, either to the house itself or to a committee, to form a correct opinion upon it; but that did not necessarily call on their lordships to institute this species of investigation; and here he wished the house to consider, that three years ago an act passed the legislature to enquire into naval abuses, and there were now upon their lordships' table, and also on the table of the other house of parliament, reports of the committee proceeding under that act. These reports contained much important and valuable information; and in consequence of the reports of that committee his majesty had been-advised to institute another commission to enquire into abuses which may be existing, and to provide such remedies for them as shall appear expedient, with a view to the improvement of the different departments, and all other matters connected with our naval service. It appeared, then, the commissioners were in the course of entering into further investigation of all these matters, for the purpose of finding out remedies for any abuses which may be found to exist. He thought it was unnecessary to say more than this as an objection to the present motion. As it was under an investigation in another quarter, it would be more expedient, and, as he thought, more becoming for the house to wait until their lordships saw the result of the enquiries already instituted, before they went into another. He submitted to the house, whether their lordships did not think the commissioners to whom he had alluded were more likely107to investigate the subject thoroughly than the committee now proposed; and that that system was more likely to lead to a practical conclusion than that proposed by the noble earl ? He was confident their lordships would not agree to this motion, unless they saw for it a pressing necessity; he submitted there did not appear any such necessity, that no case was made out, no parliamentary ground laid for this motion, and therefore, whatever might be their lordships' opinion of the existence of abuses, or of the application of remedies to them, they were in the course of investigation, and which was a much more expedient mode than the one now proposed by the motion of the noble earl.", "author_id": "/people/mr-robert-jenkinson", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},

He resisted it then, because he considered it unnecessary and uncalled for, by a fair reference to what the state of our navy then was, and he would resist it upon the same principles at the present moment.

(lord Carleton) anxious to deliver his sentiments upon the important subject then under their lordships' consideration, was extremely unwilling to prevent the house from hearing the noble lord; but having resided for so many years in Ireland, having during a considerable portion of that time held a high official situation in that country, and having been the individual who introduced the bill of 1793, he was absolutely precluded from giving a silent vote. In offering his sentiments against the motion of the noble baron, however they might militate against the prayer of the petition, he was under no apprehension of being charged with prejudice or intolerance; to such an imputation he would answer by a reference to the bill of 1793, and it would be unnecessary for him to desire a more effectual justification than would be found in the provisions of that bill. It had given to the Roman Catholics of Ireland the full enjoyment of a perfect equality of civil rights with the rest of his majesty's subjects, with an exemption from certain political obligations which are with-held from all except the protestant dissenters of that country. Under the impression of every thing that had been already conceded, he was never more surprised, than that the noble baron, whilst deprecating inflammatory language in others, should himself resort to so extraordinary a position, as that the refusing to grant what the Roman catholics had sought for in their petition could be justified only upon the principle of their being deemed traitors, and unfit even to be permitted to take the oath of allegiance, and if that were the, case, severe and oppressive as the penal code had been, it ought to be re-enacted,&#x2014;Such an argument from the lips of the noble baron could not fail to ex-745cite considerable astonishment; and more especially with those who are disposed to resist the repeal of the test and corporation acts in Great Britain; and were it just, it must equally apply. What effect such a declaration might have upon the persons affected by those acts, he would not undertake to anticipate; but he did not think it Consistent with that moderation which the noble lord had so strongly recommended. So far from agreeing with the noble lord, the earl of Buckinghamshire was decidedly of opinion, that considering the tenets of the Roman catholics, the indulgencies they had received from their sovereign and the legislature could only have been the result of a confidence in their loyalty; but so long as they acknowledged a foreign ecclesiastical jurisdiction within the united kingdom, it was impossible to entrust them with any large share of political power. Doctor Troy, a man of ability and unexceptionable character, in his pastoral letter of 1793, expresses himself in the following manner:&#x2014; \"That catholics are obliged to believe as an article of their faith, that the pope or bishop of Rome, as successor of St. Peter, is the supreme visible head of the church on earth, and the centre of catholic unity, with a primacy by divine right, of real authority and jurisdiction in the universal church, and that all catholics owe him canonical respect and obedience on that account; and that the supremacy of the pope is one of those points on which all catholics are agreed as an immutable article of their faith.\" His lordship then put it to the house, whether persons professing such a doctrine could safely be admitted to the higher offices of state or to seats in parliament. His lordship then proceeded to State that the noble baron having appealed to those peers who had held official situations in Ireland for their sentiments respecting the loyalty of the catholics, he should declare his without any reserve. He was satisfied it was better for him to answer distinctly to that appeal, lest an interpretation should be put upon his silence which was not conformable to his real opinion. He had no hesitation in saying, that the Conduct of the persons of high rank and the gentlemen of the old catholic uniformly ,been distinguished by loyalty to their sovereign and attachment to the government of the country; but he was concerned to be under the necessity of adding, that those persons had ceased to have any influence upon the catholic body: that the influence formerly exercised by them746had been vested in other hands; in the hands of men of whom he was not disposed to speak with severity&#x2014;but when he observed that they (he meant the catholic committee) employed as their agent Mr. Theobald Wolfe Tone, a man, not even of their own persuasion who was the founder of the society of united Irishmen, who was at the very time employed in an attempt to form a traiterous conspiracy for the purpose of effecting a separation between Cheat Britain and Ireland, and who was engaged in a correspondence With the French government with a view to the procuring their assistance to further his designs, the noble lord would not say, that connection with such a man was proof of disloyalty, however obliged he might be to admit that it was calculated to excite suspicion. The noble lord then read, from the publication (subsequent to the bill of 1793) of the proceedings of the Roman catholic committee, the following resolution: \"Resolved, that the, sum of fifteen hundred pounds, together With a gold medal, of the value of thirty guineas, bearing a suitable inscription, be presented to Theobald Wolfe Tone, esq. agent to the committee, as a testimony of his services and our gratitude.\" His lordship then adverted to what had fallen from the noble baron respecting the expectations the Catholics might have been induced to entertain at the time the union was under discussion. The noble baron had fairly admitted that no pledge was given, whatever hopes might have been encouraged from an assurance that the situation of the catholics would receive an impartial consideration in the parliament of the united kingdom. The noble lord said, as fir as the observation could have reference to his sentiments upon the subjects, having been one of the persons called upon to assist in preparing the articles, he must confirm the declaration of the noble baron, that no pledge had been given; but to what extent the catholics might have been justified in indulging a sanguine expectation from a discussion of their situation in the imperial parliament he could not attempt to form a conjecture. He certainly could not charge himself with having contributed to their disappointment. In the house as well as out of it he had always stated the principle upon which he acceded to the union; a principle that must preclude him from acquiescing in their being admitted to seats in parliament. The noble baron had felt, that whilst Ireland remained a separate kingdom, the objections to catholics being eligible to seats in747the house of commons were almost insuperable. The earl of Buckinghamshire was of opinion, though not exactly upon the same grounds, that the arguments against their sitting in the imperial parliament were equally forcible. In their (the catholics) situation, however, he could perceive a material difference. From being a majority in a separate, as they would become a minority in the united kingdom, their pride would naturally be less affected at the continuance of the disability. They might a more unbiassed consideration of their interests, when in their opinion local prejudices and partialities are less likely to prevail. The irritation that had been produced from a variety of circumstances, had a direct tendency to lead to such a conclusion, and his lordship saw no prospect of permanent tranquillity in Ireland, except by means of legislative union with Great Britain. With every disposition upon these grounds to give his support to that measure, his lordship expressly declared, that it would have met with his most strenuous opposition, if he could have anticipated the probability of an acquiescence in the prayer of the petition upon the table. It went, in the view he took of it, to the total annihilation of the protestant interest in Ireland. The system of representation, as settled at the union, had been so formed by the abolition of the boroughs, which had been catholics, and by throwing the whole weight of the representation into the counties, that the share the protestants would be able to retain, after the catholics sat in parliament, would be sufficient to leave them any influence in the country; and although the noble baron had treated such an idea with no small baron had treated such an idea with no small degree of contempt, saying, that nothing but bigotry could induce any man to entertain it, the noble earl was ready to acknowledge himself a bigot upon that subject; having the most perfect conviction, that if such a step was unfortunately taken as to admit the catholics into the house of commons, in the course of a very few years there would scarcely be a representative from Connaught, Leinster, and Munster, that was not of that persuasion. In those provinces the number of catholics to protestants are computed as six to one, and the freeholders in nearly the same proportion. The protestant landlords would depopulate their estates if they attempted to dispossess their catholic tenants; a measure at all events difficult to accomplish, as, from the practice in Ireland of letting the748lands for lives, a great proportion of the peasantry have freehold tenures. His lordship then asked, if any person who was conversant in the character and disposition of the Irish Catholic, would venture to state, that in an electioneering contest between a protestant and a catholic, the influence of the protestant landlord would stand a competition with that of the popish Priest. The arguments deduced from the interests of the popish religion, the possible, or rather certain relief from the payment of tithes, with the variety of inducements which the ingenuity of the priest would suggest, could leave no doubt of his ultimate success. The mischief that must arise during the few years that such a contest would continue, the manner in which it would be conducted, and the animosities that it would create, his lordship said, might be better understood by a recital from the history of Ireland, than by any representation that he could make. He then quoted a passage from Leland, who, in describing the struggle for power which took place in Ireland in the time of James the First, says: \"Agents were dispatched from the pale into every province to support the election of their friends, and to entreat the assistance of every man of quality or interest in this time of danger. The clergy preached the cause of religion, and denounced their excommunications on those who should presume to vote against the friends of the holy Roman church.\" Having endeavoured to convince the house, that, in three provinces out of the four, Connaught, Leinster, and Munster, the representation, with scarcely an exception, would be catholic, his lordship proceeded to state, that in Ulster the catholic, with the protestant dissenters, constituted a great proportion of the population; and said he would leave to the house seriously to consider the effects that such a weight of dissenting interest thrown into the house of commons might have with respect to the security of the church establishment. How soon the common object of all the dissenters might be accomplished, must depend upon circumstances; but that that object would be the destruction of the property of the church, no doubt could be entertained. His lordship then adverted to the evidence of Doctor Macnevin, a catholic and a rebel, in his examination before the committee of the Irish house of commons, in 1798.&#x2014;Q, \"Have you seen a resolution of the Leinster provincial committee of the 19th February, 1798. viz. that they would not be749diverted from their purpose by any thing which could be done in parliament, as nothing short of the total emancipation of their country would satisfy them?A.\"I have.\"&#x2014;Q. \"Do you think the mass of the people in the provinces of Munster, Leinster, and Connaught, care the value of this pen, or the dip ink which it contains, for parliamentary reform or catholic emancipation?\"A.\"I am sure they do not&#x2014;but they wish much to be relieved from the payment of tithes.\" His lordship then said it was extraordinary to observe how much even the language of the protestant dissenter in England accorded with that of the catholic dissenter in Ireland. In the debate upon a motion for repealing the test and corporation acts in the year 1790, Mr. Burke, in the course of a most able speech opposing that motion, produced a letter written by Mr. Fletcher, a dissenter, stating, that the principles held at a meeting of dissenting ministers, at Bolton in Lancashire, were so violent that he would not stay; it described, that one member, on being asked what was their object, and whether they meant to seek for any thing more than the repeal of the language of our Saviour, \"We know those things which we are not yet able to bear.\" And, on another member's saying, \"give them a little light into what we intend,\" informed him, \"that they did not care the nip of a straw for the repeal of the test and corporation acts, but that they designed to try for the abolition of the tithes and the liturgy.\"&#x2014;The noble baron had adverted to the apprehensions entertained from the introduction of forty-five members of the presbyterian church into the house of commons, at the time of the union with Scotland, and had asked how far the predictions of that day had been realized. The noble earl admitted that they had not. But he would ask, whether the day might not yet come, if the prayer of the catholic petition was complied with, when the fate of the church of England might depend upon the Scotch representation&#x2014;when a question might arise whether the revenues of the church should not be made applicable to the exigencies of the state? The sentiments of the Irish and England dissenter had been already expressed. The church of Scotland has been emphatically described \"as being built upon a rock of poverty;\" and when a great object was to be obtained, who would be responsible that the Scotch members might not be disposed to place the750church of England upon a similar foundation? The noble lord considered the experiment too desperate to be hazarded, and trusted their lordships would not make it. The principles established at the revolution were the landmarks by which he would advise their lordships to direct their conduct. The blessings they had enjoyed, by the operation of those principles, had not been equalled by the people of any country that had ever existed. The British constitution had stood firm amidst those storms by which Europe bad been convulsed during the critical times in Which it had been their lordships destiny to live. The interests of the church were so interwoven with those of the state, that the one could not be shaken without endangering the other. No substantial reason for the proposed innovation had been adduced, whilst much cause for remaining as we were was felt by every man. The people of England, he said, looked to the decisions of their lordships with an anxious expectation, and he trusted they would not be disappointed. Feeling as he did, that the prayer of the petition might be fatal to the title of the house of Brunswick to the throne of the united kingdom, his lordship would not place the noble lord upon the woolsack in the distressing predicament of presenting a bill to his majesty for his assent, which, exclusive of other important considerations, was calculated to destroy the permanent interests of his family. His lordship would be no party to such a proposition. By leaving the petition upon the table for so many weeks, the noble baron who introduced it, had given that time for deliberation that was due to the importance of the subject. He was persuaded, it had been fully, impartially, and most seriously considered. The result, in his mind, was a determination to vote against going into the committee.", "author_id": "/people/mr-robert-hobart", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},
{"date": ["1805", "may", "13"], "content": "rose and spoke as follows: Sir, at the same time that I cannot help feeling a considerable degree of anxiety at being about to bring before the house a subject which, according to my conception of it, seems, in its probable consequences, some nearer and some more remote, to be of the very highest importance; yet I confess, I feel infinitely less agitated than upon many other subjects on which I have lately had occasion to address you. It is certainly a sort of recreation, if I may be allowed so to express myself, after having been obliged to perform the harassing duties of accusation; after having promoted enquiries into circumstances, certainly not more honourable to the country at large than to the individual concerned in them; after having had my mind so harassed and occupied, to feel that I am not now the mover of accusation, but that I am pleading the cause of my fellow subjects, and that I urn endeavouring to add to the strength of the country, without taking from the credit, power, or authority of any living man in the empire. I cannot help being sensible of the contrast between the duties lately imposed upon me, and that of attempting to draw the attention of the house to a subject, which, however embarrassing the discussions of it may be to some persons, has at least this advantage, that it rests entirely on principles of general affection and good will, connected With views which every man must approve, and no man can condemn. The question, sir, that I have the honour of bringing before you, and I do feel it a great honour to have been desired to bring it before you, is no less than a petition, signed not indeed by any very great number of persons, but embracing, and I take it at the lowest calculation, when I say, one-fifth of his majesty's subjects. Nay, further, I believe I shall not be incorrect, if I state them at one-fourth of the whole of his majesty's subjects in Europe. My duty, therefore, calls upon me to plead the cause of 3 or 4 millions of the people of Ireland, without reference to the proportion they bear to the population of that part of the empire, but which must be allowed to contain the greater proportion of the catholic subjects of his majesty&#x2014;a proportion amounting to nearer a fourth than a fifth of the whole population of the empire. I feel particularly fortunate, that when I am835pressing the claims of the catholics of Ireland to the consideration of this house, I am not pressing them as adverse or hostile to the power or pre-eminence, much less the liberty, or privileges, of the subjects of any other part of the country. If I could persuade the house to do justice to the catholics, I should persuade them to render a most important service indeed, perhaps the most essential that remains to be done, or that ever was done, for the security, the greatness, and general weal of the empire, whether with regard to its internal policy, or external relations.&#x2014;It may be somewhat difficult for me to choose on what part of the subject it is most proper to begin. The plain and simple statement of the question, and the first argument in support of it, would naturally be drawn from matter of fact, concerning which no controversy or difference of opinion ever did or can exist; I mean the number of persons who are affected by the question. If I had not heard that different opinions were entertained with respect to the policy and expediency of granting the prayer of this petition, I should hardly think it could be a question, whether a portion of his. majesty's subjects, so considerable as nearly one-fourth, should be on a footing With the remainder, or should have the enjoyment of equal laws, privileges, or advantages, and the full participation and benefit of the constitution and government of the country? Against the principle so generally stated, cause may be shown, suppositions may be urged, and facts may be referrer to, with a view to show that this, as well as any other general principle, may be liable to error. I Will not detain the house long upon this point; but it is necessary I should call its attention to a topic, which may be considered more an object of theory than any thing else. I shall trouble the house tint shortly, and only explain my opinion, that, whatever difference of sentiment and feeling may exist, that difference is purely theoretical&#x2014;the question, in point of practical application, is precisely the same. What some call rights, and what others call indulgences, are precisely and exactly the same. The differences are rather differences between words than things.&#x2014; There are two modes of considering this question; 1st, as it regards the rights of the subject and 2dly, as it affects the rights of the right of crown. That which was most in fashion at different periods of the last century, was the latter mode of viewing it. For my own part, I do consider the rights of the people836governed to be the prominent rights. I consider, that those who compose the society of a state have a complete and unquestionable right to equality of law; but I do at the same time admit, that this principle is not to be taken generally. I admit the force of the other general maxim, that salus populi suprema est lex, and ought with propriety to be considered as an exception, Not only very able men, but men of practical knowledge, have in their closets considered it in that light. A most respectable modern writer of our own country, now living, (Dr. Paley) has stated, that the general right of government is to do whatever may be necessary for the advantage of the people: but he, and every man of sense, will tell you, that although this is undoubtedly the general right, yet whenever it is exercised by restrictions with regard to one class of the people, such exercise becomes ail abuse; or, in other words, the people have a right not to he restricted in any thing that is not adverse to the safety of the country. The people have a right to be exempted generally from unequal restriction; but when the safety of the country demands it, and history shows us that such instances are numerous, they are exceptions to the rule, and have always been so considered.&#x2014;In the way in which different persons consider this subject, a difference of opinion has been produced, but the conclusion is the same. Some say they would give the catholics what they require, as a matter of favour, and a matter of policy; but not as a matter of right. Now, I say, I would give it to them as a matter of right: but we, however, shall not differ, if the practical consequence of our reasoning come to the same thing. I would give it as a right, because it is the general right of the people, and because there is no exception which ought to operate against the catholics of Ireland. Though government has a right to impose restrictions; yet, if there be no necessity for them, then comes the right of the people to enjoy the benefit of every law, provided such enjoyment is not mischievous in its consequences to the country. It was therefore, sir, I wished to say these few words, because it is so important a part of the subject, and one which, from the nature of it, cannot be a question to-day, but may recur and become a question for future consideration. I should wish that all should understand each other, and particularly that it should not be supposed there is any essential difference, when, in fact, it837is a difference of words rather than of principles. Whatever differences exist with respect to the two theories, it is evident they lead to the same practical consequences. To apply this to the Roman catholics of Ireland, I do not lay down a principle too large, when I state that it is the general right of the catholics, as well as of the Protestants, to be on an equal footing, to have equal laws, privileges, and immunities, in all cases where they are not prejudicial to the welfare of the state. The only differences that could arise would be with regard to the degree in which they should enjoy those rights. Cases might be put where persons might say nothing could justify a departure from the rule of right, but expediency. Some might say, political advantages, connected with external relations, would justify it; others would require such a degree of expediency as would amount to a necessity. They would require that not only the greatness of the country, but the security of the country, should be concerned. I flatter myself we shall not go on such near shades. The Roman catholics of Ireland have undoubtedly a right to equal laws; but the government has thought fit to curtail that right, and to put them on a footing disadvantageous to them.&#x2014;To enter into the question, whether the laws for restraining the catholics were originally politic, or, rather, whether, they were just; that is to say, whether the policy which dictated them was of such a nature as to render that just which was not within the general rule of justice, would be a discussion exceedingly unnecessary at this moment. At the same time, it will be necessary to attend to the particular period of history in which these restrictions were principally imposed. I think I need not state what will be the argument in reply. No man's. mind, I hope, is so framed as to imagine that the restrictions can be justified on account of the length of time they have been allowed to continue. Such an opinion would be a solicism in political reasoning; it would do away the original principle on which such slaws were founded, to contend, that though they might be unnecessary at the dine they were adopted, yet that, by a long lapse of time, they have acquired a prescriptive light. If a restrictive law is made on account of peculiar circumstances of a political nature, the moment those circumstances cease the restriction ceases to be politic, and consequently ceases to be just. I cannot conceive how any man can be justified in supposing838that, where the circumstances on which A law is founded have ceased, the justice of continuing that law can be a matter for fair reasoning. It may so happen, though I think it has not so happened in this case, but it has nearly happened, that the fact of long restrictions may make it difficult afterwards to restore the objects of them to that situation in which they would have been if the restrictions had never been imposed. I think one may generally state, that all the restrictions of the catholics were laid, not on their religious but their political opinions. At the time they were made, I have doubt whether many of those who concurred in them did not disapprove of the principle; and have doubts also, whether. others did not mix sentiments of persecution and rancour with those restrictions. I would not wish to go to antient times; but in the early period of the reigns of Queen Elizabeth and James I. no one can suppose it was any particular religious bigotry that led to the restrictions with regard to the catholics. As far as one can learn of the character of Queen Elizabeth, her faith was not so repugnant to the catholic religion as that of many protestant ministers, who were principally concerned in the restrictions. She managed the question with a degree of prudence which proved her one of the most consummate princes of the age. She seemed to be engaged in a general war with several great catholic powers, and particularly with the King of Spain. From the connexion which the King of Spain had with catholics by the league with France, she was necessarily involved in disputes with France, as well as other powers of the continent; therefore they were political circumstances which occasioned those harsh and severe laws against the catholics which passed in her reign. Whatever other pretences might have been resorted to, it is plain the catholics were not considered as the loyal subjects of Queen Elizabeth. But I am speaking of old times, and the circumstances them do not relate to the present. Even in the reigns that followed, very few restrictions by penal law were enacted, very restrictions of disabilities took place till a much later period. This may be accounted for from the circumstance that there was no suspicion of the catholics; but afterwards, in the time of the Stuarts, and Charles I and II, suspicions had taken possession of the minds of people of this country, which made those restrictions necessary, many of which have been done away, and839some are now under consideration. When we come to the revolution, it is impossible not to see that all the laws of the Catholics were political laws. It was not a catholic, but a Jacobite, you wished to restrain. When King James was driven from the country; when his enormous tyranny became so mixed with bigotry, that many persons professed to be able to unravel his conduct, and tell what to attribute to religion, what to bigotry, and what to tyranny, it was easy to suppose that the catholics should be actuated by an attachment for a king who had lost his throne in consequence of his partiality for their faith. Ireland at this time was the seat of civil war. Undoubtedly it was natural, after that war was settled by conquest, to prevent the conquered from enjoying the privileges of the conquerors. It was not against the religious faith of those who adored the Virgin Mary, or believed in the doctrine transubstantiation.&#x2014;King William was unquestionably a great man; I may say the greatest that ever filled the throne of this or any other country; but whoever would wish to raise his character, by representing him as a persecutor of heresy and idolatry, materially mistake the character of that prince. I am persuaded, that be most reluctantly consented to harsh measures against the catholics of Ireland, and only did so, because it was represented to him by his ministers, that they Were absolutely necessary. That King William would have acted wiser, if he had made those restrictions less harsh, it is not now our business to consider. King William, in conceding his own to the opinion of others, acquiesced, on the ground of the difference of opinion among the Roman catholics as to the right of succession to the crown, and in conformity to that advice which his ministers gave him. The years that followed the revolution were most of them years of war; and those that were not years of war, were, with reference to the catholics, years of a suspicious nature. Endeavours were made to bring about a religious war, in which it was impossible for the enemy not to have looked with confidence to the assistance of Ireland, and therefore the catholics were disarmed. It might have been wise so to do. That there were bigoted motives actuating some I will not attempt to deny&#x2014; there were many persons in this, as well as that country, who were of opinion, that by these persecution they should convert to the protestant the property of the whole kingdom of Ireland: other there were, who840thought that more lenient measures were likely to be more successful. The effect proved that the measures adopted not only failed, but they were of a nature which rendered their success absolutely impossible. They were laws which, though nominally against the catholics were substantially against the jacobites. In the two next reigns the same laws continued, because the same spirit was supposed to exist, and the same danger to be apprehended from it. In the rebellions which followed, the conduct of the catholics in remaining quiet, gave them a just claim to the indulgence of the house; yet no man who considers the grounds of those rebellions, will think that any degree of trust could have been reposed in the catholics.&#x2014;We come now to the period of his present majesty's reign: a period at which all danger of a pretender, and the return of the Stuart family to the throne, was extinguished. I should certainly say, that all danger of that nature had vanished in the latter end of the reign of George II., and that there was no longer any dispute as to the succession to his majesty's crown. From that period no further danger existed. During the lord-lieutenancy of the duke of Bedford, at the time of his majesty's accession, the system of relaxation towards the body of the catholics was adopted. There was a remarkable circumstance at the period to which I am referring, that proves to me more clearly than any thing else, that the causes of these restrictions were at an end. So far Was the lord-lieutenant of Ireland, during the American war, and the war with France, from pretending that there was any danger to be apprehended, that upon an alarm on the coast of Cork, arms, though contrary to law, were put into the hands of those against whom the restrictions remained, on account of the unjust suspicions that they were not worthy of being trusted. Then undoubtedly there was a good deal of difference of opinion; for although there was not much doubt in this house, yet gentlemen must know that the catholics of Ireland were the subject of much consideration. I need only refer to the letters published by the late Mr. Burke relative to the conversations in those days. I remember in 1776 or 1777, the matter being mentioned in a conversation in this house. It became a topic of discussion ring the period of the American war, when party politics ran high, and when persons felt warm, as undoubtedly they ought to feel upon occasions such public im-841portance. The opinion then was, that it was a desirable thing to liberate the catholics from the disqualifications which attached to; and I rather believe that the real grounds of the motion, and the bill, moved and seconded by two celebrated names, sir George Saville and Mr. Dunning, were not so much to relieve the catholics of Ireland. I did conceive, that to bar a man of his right on account of his religious opinions, was tyranny, that the maxim of salus populi never could apply, because the safety of the people could not operate as a ground for preventing a man from enjoying his religious opinion. A great disposition was shown to follow up the system of relaxation. It was thought that what had been done might lead to a relaxation of all the laws against the catholics. All that scattered men's minds at the time was this,&#x2014;an apprehension of the pope or pretender. There might have been in some persons sentiments of respect and compassion, and in others an inclination to taunt or insult; but there was not one person who had any degree of fear or terror, as one single ingredient in forming his opinion. It was said, that the restrictions in Ireland, the ferocious manners of those who were protestants, and the insults sustained by the catholics, had produced, as Mr. Burke says, a degree of desperation in that unhappy people, which made it doubtful how far they were to be trusted. The effect of the system had been that of changing, by degrees, the whole property of Ireland, and that country was brought into a state highly to be lamented. I do not mean to make any comparison between the treatment of the black slaves on the coast of Africa, and that of the people of Ireland; I mean only to state, that it was a circumstance likely to produce the general disaffection of the people, that the whole of the property was in the hands of the protestant ascendancy, while the mass of the population was catholic. Even among those whose forms of government are less free than ours, the property and power should go hand-in-hand, and there should be no other distinction except that of the proprietor and the servant. We began by enabling the catholics to acquire property. What has been the consequence? The power connected with the free trade and constitution we gave to Ireland in 1782, has produced an increase of property beyond all proportion greater than that enjoyed by the Protestants. There has been not only an increase of mercantile property among the ca-842tholics of Ireland, but also of the landed property. This has been attended with they happiest effect. It has produced the effect of softening and correcting those distinctions between the catholics and the protestants, which were found so oppressive. The catholics are now possessed of a great deal of that property which was taken froth their ancestors. I mention this, because one of the apprehensions with respect to the catholics was, that they had preserved memoirs of the ancient state of property, and that, on a favourable opportunity, they were to claim of the protestants all the property that belonged to their ancestors. This objection has been completely clone away; for at this moment, if you were to reverse the act of settlement, and restore the property of those who possessed before Cromwell's time, I believe the catholics would he as great sufferers as the protestants. And what catholics? Why, the catholics who are now rich and powerful, viz. the only catholics to whom we would give an addition of power. From the time of the acquisition of property by the catholics, I have never been able to conceive on what principle their demands were not conceded to them; least of all, why particular restrictions should have been kept up, when others were abandoned. What are the restrictions now existing? The general restrictions may be comprised under these two heads: one, the incapacity under which the catholics lie with regard to the enjoyment of certain offices, civil and military; the other, the incapacity of sitting in either house of parliament. Gentlemen who have attended to all this history of the restrictions of the catholics (sorry I am to say, a large chapter in the history of Great Britain,) need not be told, that it has been useless with reference to the ends proposed, and certainly odious to those who have been affected by it. I believe it is not considered by foreigners as that part of our constitution which is most deserving of admiration. The two heads of restrictions are quite distinct. Suppose I proceed to consider, first, that with respect to offices; the restrictions under this head go either to limit the prerogative of the crown or the choice of the people. We restrain the prerogative of the crown in appointing the catholics to certain offices: let us examine on what ground. Originally the test act was for the purpose of excluding the catholics from the service of Charles II, to prevent catholics being appointed by Charles II. to executive offices: and here a very whimsical but strong843observation occurs. One of the most popular arguments in favour of the test, with a view to the restraint on the prerogative, and I have heard it frequently used, was, that it was necessary to make the constitution agreeable to analogy; and that when it was insisted that the king should be of the church of England, it was necessary all his officers should be of the same persuasion. What beautiful uniformity there is in this, I own I cannot see. I apprehend that our ancestors reasoned in a very different manner. I apprehend it was not because we forced the king to be a protestant, that we found it necessary to have his officers of the same religion, but because we doubted whether the king was in reality a protestant or not, and because we suspected him of a design to overturn the constitution of the county, as in the case of James II. If we suspected him of being a catholic, it Was right we should not suffer any officers to be near him who might assist him in an infraction of the constitution. But it is the most strange reasoning I ever heard, that because the king being a protestant, and therefore not liable to suspicion, you are to prevent him from having the assistance of his catholic subjects. This test passed in the reign of Charles II., and with the approbation of a very great man (Mr. Locke), who observed, that it might have been a necessary measure. The next reign was that James II., who was a professed Catholic. If there was any virtue in other days&#x2014;God knows there was little enough in his: if he had repealed the test act, it would have been for the purpose of obtaining the Means of acting against the liberty of the subject. Then how came the laws to be continued? The continuation of the test laws after the revolution, was because the dissenters being included in the test act, it was the object of the high church party to hold the dissenters to a law which they had favoured. It was a kind of compromise, on enacting it against the Roman catholics, to say, we will retain it against you. In this control of the parliament, it ought to be observed how the question stands. The test does not prevent the king from appointing a catholic to any office, civil or military; it only makes it necessary, after a certain time, for the person appointed to do certain act. With respect to the catholic dissenters, you have given it up in a great number of points, and you have maintained it in others. We come now to the distinction of those cases in which you have given844up the restraint. You have given it regard to all subordinate offices in the army and navy, and in the profession of the law, but you refuse it with respect to the higher offices. Then you say to the catholics, \"we have kept nothing from you as a body; you do not all expect to be chancellors, generals, staff officers, admirals, or other great officers; therefore, as you do not all expect to arrive at these distinctions, there can be no harm in forbidding any of you to obtain them!\" Do you wish the Roman catholics to be actuated by a sense that they are trusted by the executive government, or not? If not, and you should, in giving them offices, appear to entertain diffidence and mistrust of them, they will be executed with that remissness and disregard of the public service which such mistrust is calculated to inspire. Suppose I send to a gentleman of the law, and I say to him, it is true you may possess talents, but do you think there is any probability of your being lord chancellor? He might probably answer, that there was not; but is there not a very material difference in having an impossibility and bar put to the advancement of a man to the honours of his profession? Suppose a person is engaged in trade, and he can gain a bare living, or perhaps save about twenty pounds a year. I say to him, \"you may go on, and be as industrious as you please, but you shall never make more than 1,000,000l.\" He says, he is contented. Well, but does any one think that this country could have arrived at the height it has, if there had been such a restriction on the exertions of industry? It is not because a man's quality is low, that he is prevented by the exercise of his faculties from becoming wealthy; but if you limit his endeavours, you destroy the spirit of enterprise and exertion which impels him, and, by such a system finally prevent his success. Do you not think it would be the most destructive blow to the enterprise, industry, and energy of the country, and undermine the principal source of our riches, to put a restraint on the exercise of a man's genius and industry? Do we not often hear of a person, not of consequence either from birth or fortune, say, \" I live, thank God, in a country, were, by industry and talents, I may arrive at the fortune of the greatest duke in the land.\" Is not this cheering? Is not the unlimited power of gain the great principle on which industry, enterprise, and commerces exist? What should we say if men of particular descriptions were to be restricted in845their fair pursuits? They stand marked and circumscribed to the limit of their possible gain. Apply the principle to the professions&#x2014;to the law particularly, the one perhaps in which it operates the most. I would ask those who are conversant with the profession, whether it would not damp the ardour of a young man, if he were to be told that he might obtain some pecuniary advantage, but that he could never rise to any office of dignity. I am not supporting the propriety of indulging sanguine hopes, but certainly one of the greatest incentives in the breast of a parent to give his son a good education, is the hope of one day seeing him till the situation Of chancellor, or some other splendid office. Take that hope away, and you destroy the greatest incentive to an aspiring mind. But when you apply the argument to a military life, how much stronger is it! Is Hot the very essence of the profession ambition, and a thirst of glory? What can you expect of a lieutenant or captain, who, after exerting himself in the service of the country, comes home, and, reflecting upon the dangers he has shared, admires the skill and ability of his commander, or perhaps thinks something might have been done better&#x2014;what must he his feelings, if he is obliged to add, \" But I can never expect to command an army; all my thoughts are useless; I may be a colonel, perhaps a general, but a general on the staff, that I can never be! I go to my station, because I am a man of honour; but can I do it with the same eagerness as if, after have escaped the danger, my reward was to he proportioned? Does not such a consideration as this lay an extinguisher on military enterprise? Is it not desirable that every man should look, for the purpose of exciting his activity and zeal, to future rewards of the highest sort? But put it in another way. Is it not of importance that every man entrusted with the concerns of others should feel the necessity of gaining a great character for ability and integrity? It is not only satisfactory but necessary. But if you say, there there is a plus ultra, beyond which you cannot go&#x2014;you are to think only filling your coffers, quocunque modo rem, how different must be the situation of him who feels he can never rise in his profession, though endued with the most splendid talents, compared with the man whose exertions are excited by the prospect of future honours! Do you think these men the Catholics, do not believe themselves to be a marked people, separated from the rest of the community, not on account of then846religious opinons, but the-political opinions connected with them? In all great concerns, the extent of the justice or injustice is of considerable importance. Who is it you are thus stigmatizing and degrading? Is it a people of a particular way of thinking? No, it is three-fourths of the people of Ireland, and one-fourth of all his majesty's subjects in Europe. Would you think, that, under these circumstances, such a thing could be, so far as to the part that relates to the control of the king's prerogative? I ought, however, first to mention the exclusion from being sheriffs; but that is more connected with the jurisdiction I shall have to mention hereafter. Can any body suppose, that government would be likely to put improper persons into the office of sheriff in Ireland? Would they nominate catholic sheriffs, to raise disturbances? I say, it is one of the occasions in which it is least possible to suspect an abuse of the King's prerogative, and where it ought not to be controlled. Now with respect to parliament, the votes of the peers in parliament subsisted during the reigns of Elizabeth, James I. Charles I. and II. till somewhere about the period of 1698. I would ask the most zealo is historian that took the side against the Stuarts, whether any mischief by the votes of the catholic peers did really occur? Here I quote Mr. Locke, who says&#x2014; \"and with respect to the votes of the catholic peers, I think, provided the test act is preserved, they are fit and beneficial.\" When did they cease? In 1698, upon discovery of the popish plot, suppose it to be true or false, when the country was thrown into a paroxysm of terror, when it was believed that the catholics were going to massacre the protestants, when it was expected they were to have the assistance of the king of Spain, and when the ridiculous story of the silver bullets was set on foot. It was at such a moment of popular fury this measure passed. No man thought of expelling the catholics from parliament till the people had been put into a paroxysm of rage and terror. Why did they do this? Because there was nothing else to be done against them: it was for no other reason they passed that intolerable law, which put an end to their sitting the house of commons&#x2014;You come now that part of the case which does not affect to diminish the power of the king, but to con[...]trol the rights of the people. You go to the elector of Ireland, and you shall not elect a catholic. Upon what principal is it you conceive, that in a Roman847catholic has mischievous project in his head, it can be defeated by keeping him out of parliament? It has always been the objection to the test act, that two descriptions of protestants are in the house of commons. We know the dissenters do sit, and have become the most meritorious of any of its members. What is the objection to the catholics? That they cannot wish well to the church of England. Why, that is your argument against the dissenters. You do not deny the dissenters the privilege of sitting in parliament, though you say they do not approve the church establishment. But the practice is every thing. What would be the practical effect of the catholics having a seat in the house of commons? Does any man believe, that if there were a total repeal of these restrictive laws, there would be twenty catholic members returned from Ireland to this house? But I would take it according to the population of the country, and say, that there were four-fifths catholic. If, contrary to all the principles that govern elections, the mere population were the only thing to be considered, this would, perhaps, give about 80 members. Now the house consists of 658 members. Supposing it possible that 80 catholics were to be returned out of that number, though I do not think there would be more than twenty, could they he dangerous to the establishment of this country? If the doctrine of virtual representation be well founded, would it not add to the true virtual representation of this country, if three-fourths of the representatives were catholics? When people put the argument to extremes, and say, that this place is not represented, and that place is not represented, but that you have those in the house of commons who represent the whole community; that the trading and commercial interests, and the military, naval, and learned professions, are all duly represented; that you have the landed country gentlemen, statesmen and politicians, soldiers, sailors, merchants, lawyers&#x2014;in fact, that you have a kind of virtual representation of all the people of the coutnry,&#x2014;I deny it: you have not the representation of the Roman catholics&#x2014;you want what you are afraid to have&#x2014;you ought to desire what they pray for&#x2014;you ought to have that complete virtual representation they offer you. I have been speaking for the public benefit&#x2014;I now speak for the benefit of the catholics. You say to the people of Birmingham, Sheffield, and Manchester, it is true, you seed no members to the house of commons, but you have members of parlia-848ment who fare connected with the commerce and manufactures of those places. It is true; but still it is my wish to have a more direct representation. The fact is, the virtual representation is undoubtedly a vital principle in the constitution of the country. If any particular class of men are excluded, you have not a real virtual representation, in the sense the word representation ought to he understood, implying a sympathy and fellow feeling between the representative and the persons represented. The very substance of representation is, that the members of parliament should not be able to tax their constituents without taxing themselves. Now I say that there is no feeling of this kind with respect to the catholics. Upon the same principle you deprive the electors of Ireland from electing Roman catholics&#x2014;you deny the corporations the right of choosing them, for they cannot be at the head of any corporation. I want to know upon what principle it is that corporations are to be denied the privilege of appointing catholics to the office of mayor, or other superior offices? Corporations being composed chiefly of protestants, there is not much danger, as some would say, or not much hope, as others would say, of the catholics being admitted. Is not this one of those additional instances in which you keep the stigma without any practical advantages? You fix an unnecessary stigma on the catholics; and an unnecessary stigma is, of all modes of punishment, that which is most grating to the people, and destructive of the unanimity and concord necessary for the safety of the state. I shall say a very few words as to certain objections to the matter of this petition. I think the objections to the jacobites are given up; but it is said, that there is something in the nature of the Roman catholics that makes it dangerous to grant them the same privileges as protestants. Some have stated, that there is a general impropriety and incongruity in persons of different religious principles acting together. I should like to know the theory on which this argument rests. I am speaking now of religious differences;&#x2014;why two men sitting in council together should, instead of inquiring how the forces of the country ought to be disposed of, and where the fleets ought to be sent, whether to Jamaica or any other part of the West Indies, fall to a discussion about transubstantiation, and dispute because one adores the Virgin Mary and the other adores the saints? Is it to be supposed that justices on the bench, when they try criminal or civil points, will quit their duty,839in order to commence idle controversies on religion points? There are countries where the law and religion are one and the same thing; where consequently, there would be an impropriety in separating them: but I want to know, upon what principle it is that men may not act together, who entertain strong differences on religious creeds. This stands upon theory only, for the practice is against it. Is there Europe one state or country that does not employ persons of different religious persuasions in the highest offices? In former times even this was the practice, when there was more heat and animosity. When bigotry was at its height in France, when it led Henry the Fourth to renounce the protestant and embrace the catholic religion, in order to obtain the throne of the kingdom, did ever occur to any one to suggest, that the Duke de Sully, his minister, who was a protestant, could not advise with him about public affairs? Was he ever accused of being a bad minister, because he was a protestant? No one ever objected to M. Neckar, the minister of the late king of France, because he was a prolate king France, because he was protestant. Does not the emperor of Germany employ protestant in the various important affairs of dominions? The government of Vienna is intrusted to prince Ferdinand of Wirtemberg, a protestant. It is true, the bigotry of Frederick the Great could not induce him to employ protestants as his minister or officers; but perhaps it was because he could not find any that were fit for his service. What is the case with Russia? The first employment in the service of the emperor of Russia if filled by prince Sartoriski, whose religions is that of the Greek church. With regard to the Swiss cantons, the employment of protestants has been, perhaps, less than in other places, but they have frequently filled offices of government jointly with the catholics. In the democratic canton of Uri, and some other, the catholics were more numerous; a proof that they may take an active part in the administration of a popular government, without any evil consequences resulting from the opinions they profess. In the canton of Appenzel the catholic and protestants are half and half.&#x2014; The pretender being gone, and all other question of radical difficulty removed as to him, we now come to another person&#x2014;the pope. I wish to know whether, during the last 200 years, the pope had been a person to be feared? If he has, it can only have, been in one way, by his oppression of the catholic. Long before the period of the revolution, all the political840influence of the pope, with respect to country, had ceased. His power became afterwards absolutely insignificant; and during the whole of the question between the house of Stuart and Brunswick, it was notorious that the pope could not stir one Roman catholic in Ireland. But it is stated that the persons principally concerned in the rebellion of 1798 were Roman catholics. I have no doubt that the catholic had there share in that rebellion; but were they stigated by the pope? What! by the pope, while he was in a state of servitude and humiliation? Did the pope, while he looked to this county as almost his only support, wish to overturn our government, and prevail on the Irish catholics to follow Messrs. O'Connor, Emmett, and M'Nevin? This fear of the influence of the pope, when he has no power to do us harm, and when he cannot do us good, even thought he wished it, is perfectly absurd. It is an alarm which can be accounted for on no rational principal. Has the recollection of the proconsuls, sent by the C&#x00E6;sars to govern this country, left such an impression upon us, as to make us dread every thing that comes from Rome? But it is said, Buonapart&#x00E9; has obtained an influence over the pope, the pope governs the Irish priests, and thus Buonapart&#x00E9; will be able to attach to him the catholic of Ireland. Without canvassing the question of the inclination of the pope to serve the views of Buonapart&#x00E9;, I shall admit that the French government will willingly employ his influence so far as they can obtain it. That the great enemy of this country would be very willing to make use of such an engine to serve his purpose in Ireland, I have no doubt. But how will he use his influence? If you will repeal these laws, you will have nothing to fear from that quarter; but if, on the contrary, you persevere in your restrictions, the way in which influence so much dreaded may be exercised can only be this: The Irish catholic will be told, 'An equal participation of right was held out to you; but, instead of granting your just claims, instead of affording you relief and protection you were promised, you are still stigmatized as outcasts. You have, therefore, now only to look a catholic emperor for assistance, and through him you may expect the[...]which had been denied you. This is the language which may be used if you are determined to persist in your present system; but, in the other alternative, what influence can the pope have? Suppose he were to direct the priests to take care that non but Roman catholic841member were chose for Ireland and suppose this influence were so far to succeed as to bring a considerable proportion of Roman catholics into this house among the representatives from Ireland, is it likely that Buonapart&#x00E9; would find many friends among these Roman catholic members? If there were eighty members Roman catholics, it would be an extravagant supposition indeed to say that even three of them would be so dead to all sense of honour and duly, so blind to the interests and happiness of their country, as to become the instruments of Buonapart&#x00E9;. Of the influence to be used in this way by the pope, surely no reasonable person can entertain any serious apprehension. Is it possible to look forward to any future circumstances under which that influence can become dangerous? Great men, it is said, have long views; but some views are so long, that my sight; I must confess, cannot reach them. It has been said of our system of government, esto perpetua; but I should desire no better security for the power and the constitution of this country lasting for ever, than that they should continue until either a pope or a Buonapart&#x00E9; could obtain a majority in this house. &#x2014;I must now turn to another view of the question. It has always been maintained that the differences between the Roman catholics and the Protestants are not merely religious, but political. It is on this ground the oaths the former are required to take are defended. The oath is framed against the authority Of a foreign priest, though that authority is merely spiritual. But if it be any objection to the Roman catholics, that they deny the king's supremacy, what do you say to the opinions of the people of Scotland? The presbyterian religion, which is established in Scotland, does not admit the king to be the head of the church; and surely the presbyterian doctrine and discipline of it are at least as repugnant to the established religion of this country, as the. opinions of the Roman catholics are! Yet Scotland, with this presbyterian church, forms a part of the united kingdom. But do not the Roman catholics swear, that no temporal consequences whatever follow from the doctrine they hold on the question of Supremacy? They do swear, and yet it is said we cannot believe them. What! are they not to be believed On oath, because they are Roman catholics? To make such a declaration, is to display to my mind either great malignancy of heart, or an extraordinary deficiency of understanding: but if the declaration were made on the part of the go-842vernment of this country, it would be an avowal of wickedness beyond any thing I can conceive. Would you say, that you proposed and passed acts of parliament to persuade them to swear that which you would not believe when sworn? Would you own that you wished to seduce them into perjury? The moment you find that a man attends mass, he is therefore a Roman catholic, and therefore no longer to be believed. To add to the absurdity, you frame another oath, to keep out of parliament those very persons of whom it is said you must not believe that which they swear. This is really at once insulting to the understanding and the feelings of mankind. It is more than a generous and ingenuous mind can be expected patiently to bear.&#x2014;I shall not pretend to enter into controversial arguments on the question of doctrine. Indeed, that is a subject respecting which I own I have neither sufficient learning nor patience to fit me for the discussion; but if I had as much of both as the lord chancellor of Ireland, I am sure his example would deter me from undertaking so arduous a task. When I consider the state of religion in Europe, of which perhaps three-fourths of the inhabitants are Roman catholics, I am astonished that such opinions respecting that religion can be maintained. Is it possible that any man can be found bold enough to say of three-fourths of the inhabitants of civilized Europe, that they are not to be believed upon oath? Such an assertion implies, that Roman catholic nations are not only incapable of the relations of peace and amity, but unfit for any of the relations of society whatever. The existence of any such maxim supposes gross ignorance and barbarism in the people among whom it prevails. Every enlightened mind, every man who wishes well to his country, must treat it with scorn and indignation. When a bill was some time ago introduced respecting the army, I objected to the oaths it contained, on the ground that it was not fit to ask any man to take them; but it will be extraordinary indeed, if those who insisted upon prescribing these oaths should now turn round, and declare, that they will not believe them when taken. When the petition I had the honour to bring into this house was first read, the clear and temperate statement of the case which it contains appeared to make a deep impression. I think I could see gentlemen say to themselves this is not the way I used to think of the Roman catholics. No, certainly not. It is not the way in which many used to843think, because they had received false impressions from persons who perhaps had an interest in misleading their judgment. But it has since been whispered, that the language of the petition signifies nothing, because it is subscribed only by laymen. I can assure the house, however, that there is no ground of any suspicion on this account. The reason why there are no names of priests in the petition is, because it relates only to civil rights; on this account only, clerical persons thought it would be improper in them to subscribe it. The oath, however, has been taken by all the archbishops, bishops, and most of the priests of Ireland; and if it be thought necessary that it should be taken over again, it will be taken. I, however, have always regarded the administration of the oath as improper, and I recollect having some difference of opinion with a late noble friend of mine on this subject, 1 mean lord Petre, from whom, had he sat in the house of lords, the established religion of this country would have had nothing to fear, for he would have only obtained more frequent opportunities of displaying his sincere attachment to the constitution. His lordship defended the oath, because it afforded the Roman catholics an opportunity of publicly contradicting the calumnies reported against them. I said, that that might be an object with him, but it was none with me, and that I did not wish such a law to remain on our statute-book. Having stated that I entirely disapprove of this oath, I must, however, inform the house, that I have at this moment, in my pocket, a letter from several of the archbishops and bishops, declaring that they have taken and signed the oath. They also declare, that it contains nothing contrary to the doctrines or faith of the Roman catholic religion, and that it is to be taken equally by the clergy and the laity; but foreseeing that the fact of the oath being taken might be questioned, certificates have been sent from the courts before which it was administered. It is in these courts, therefore, a matter of record, and the authority of the fact is completed. It is said, that since the Roman catholics have already got so much, they ought not to ask for more. My principle, however, is directly the reverse. It is natural that men in a state of servitude should wish to recover their rights; that they should desire to assimilate their rights with those of their fellow-citizens, in order that they may acquire a greater degree of similarity with them. It is their ambition to be844no longer slaves, but to become men. They ask this; and until they,obtain all they want, they have comparatively gained nothing. It would be to shut your eyes to all the evidence of history, to suppose that you could impose upon men an obligation not to look forward to the complete acquirement of their rights; from the moment they began to enjoy any of them, they must aspire to be on a parity with the rest of their fellow-citizens The better argument is, that having already conceded so much, what remains is nothing to you to give. Nothing can be more absurd than the conduct which is adopted towards the Roman catholics. You admit the lower orders into the army and navy, and you prevent the higher from rising to that rank they might expect to attain. You put arms into the hands of men, who, if the French were to land, might be, from their want of knowledge, influenced to do you mischief; and yet you will not trust lord Fingal, or his brother, with a command. You rely, however, it appears, with confidence, on the loyalty of the ignorant and the prejudiced, and you intrust them with arms. Of which class of Roman catholics are you afraid; the higher, or the lower? You do not trust those whose property gives them an interest in the country, and whose superior knowledge and information teach them to prefer the government of their country to every other; but you rely on the ignorant and uninformed. You place in the hands of the latter the means of insurrection, and you take from the former the power they would have, by their influence, to repress commotions. But though you have little to give, what they have to ask is to them immense. You have left them much power to do you mischief, and have afforded them little means of doing you good. Though they require only qualification, coporation, parliament, and offices under government, the object is of great magnitude to them. It is founded on the great principle of requiring to be placed on a footing of equality with their fellow-subjects. Equality of rights is one of the principles which is dearest to the human heart, and it is one which the laws of Great-Britain, to their immortal honour, sanction. In whatever country that principle prevails, it produce the greatest of blessings. That country is truly happy, where, in the language a great modern poet,Though poor the peasant's hut, his feasts though small,He sees his little lot the lot of all;845Sees no contiguous palace rear its head,To shame the meanness of his humble shedIf a people are placed in a state of humility and degradation, can it be said, that to get out of that situation is to them nothing? But the confusion which prevails on this occasion has arisen from mixing politics and religion, two things which it has always been the wish of the wisest philosophers and statesmen to keep distinct and separate. It is with great concern I have heard, that some eminent members of the established church are hostile to the proposition I have to make; but I have some consolation in reflecting, that I have with me a person who enjoys as high a reputation as any member of the church, and for whose character I had the highest veneration and respect&#x2014;I mean, Dr. Paley. He observes, \"it has indeed been asserted, that discordancy of religions, even supposing each religion to be free from any errors that affect the safety or the conduct of government, is enough to render men unfit to act together in public stations. But upon what argument, or upon what experience, is this assertion founded? I perceive no reason why men of different religious persuasions may not sit upon the same bench, deliberate in the same council, or fight in the same ranks, as well as men of various or opposite opinions upon any controverted topic of natural philosophy, history, or ethics.\" Dr. Paley considers restraints only justifiable on account of political opinions, which may affect the safety of government. In endeavouring to state the case of exclusion, he says&#x2014;\"After all, it may be asked, why should not the legislator direct his test against the political principles themselves, which he wishes to exclude, rather than encounter them through the medium of religious tenets, the only crime and the only danger of which consist in their presumed alliance with the former? Why, for example, should a man be required to renounce transubstantiation before he be admitted to art office in the state, when it might seem to be sufficient that he abjure the pretender? There are but two answers that can be given to the objection which this question contains: first, that it is not opinions which the laws fear so much as inclinations, and that political inclinations are not so easily detected by the affirmation or denial of any abstract proposition in politics, as by the discovery of the religious creed with which they are wont to be united: secondly, that when men renounce. their religion they commonly[...]all con-846nexion with the members of the church which they have left, that church no longer expecting assistance or friendship from theme; whereas particular persons might insinuate themselves into offices of trust and authority, by subscribing political assertions, and yet retain their predilection for the interests of the religious sect to which they continued to belong. By which means government would sometimes find, though it could not accuse the individual, whom it had received into its service, of disaffection to the civil establishment, yet that, through him, it had communicated the aid and influence of a powerful station to a party who were hostile to the constitution. These answers, however, we propose rather than defend. The measure certainly cannot be defended at all, except where the suspected union between certain obnoxious principles in politics, and certain tenets in religion, is nearly universal; in which case it makes little difference to the subscriber whether the test be religious or political: and the state is somewhat better secured by the one than the other.\" I shall only take up the time of the house a few moments in reading another passage, in which it is clearly stated, that restrictions should not be continued after the circumstances in which they have originated have ceased. \"Thus, if the members of the Romish church for the most part adhere to the interests, or maintain the right, of a foreign pretender to the crown of these kingdoms, and if there he no way of distinguishing those who do from those who do not retain such dangerous prejudices, government is well warranted in fencing out the whole sect from situations of trust and power. But even in this example it is not to popery that the laws object, but to popery as the mark of jacobitism; an equivocal, indeed, and fallacious mark, but the best, and perhaps the only one that can be devised. But then it should be remembered, that as the connexion between popery and jacobitism, which is the sole cause of suspicion, and the sole justification of those severe and jealous laws which have been enacted against the professors of that religion, was accidental in its origin, so probably it will be temporary in its duration; and that these restrictions ought not to continue one day longer than some visible danger renders them necessary to the preservation of public tranquillity.\" Whatever then may be the opinions of certain members of the establishment, I am happy to have the opportunity of quoting one authority which847all who love profound learning, exalted virtue, and sound morals, must respect.&#x2014;With regard to the time when these restrictions ought to have been removed, if there could be one time more proper than another, it was when the union was carried. To that measure I certainly was hostile, and I have seen nothing since which could induce me to alter my opinion; but whether that opinion be right or wrong, is nothing to my present argument. The period at which the introduction of this measure would have been most proper, doubtless, was the moment when the expectations of the Roman catholics were raised, when hopes were held out to them, or when they themselves at least conceived that the hour of their emancipation was arrived, and that they were to be placed on an equal footing with their fellow citizens. It has been said, however, that on this subject an argument may be drawn from practice which is sufficient to silence all reasoning. No one is a greater friend to the opposition of practice to theory than I am, when that opposition is justly applied. In the present case it is observed, that when the severe laws existed against the Roman catholics in Ireland, all was tranquillity, even during the rebellions of the years 1715 and 1745; but that, after the concessions had been granted, the rebellion of 1798 broke out, in which the Roman catholics joined for the purpose of subverting the monarchy and the constitution. It this argument were true, it would go only to this; that restrictions are good for keeping mankind in a state of tranquillity; and, therefore, you ought never to release them from severe laws, never restore them to their rights. This argument goes against every principle of liberty, and is only calculated to support the cruellest tyranny and most degrading slavery. Its present object is to deprive of their rights one-fourth of his majesty's subjects, and to place them in a state which must greatly embarrass the power and resources of the empire. Surely if there be a malady in our situation, this is it. But were there no circumstances besides the concessions, which rendered the situation of the Irish catholics very different in the year 1798 from what that situation was in the reign of George II? Is it supposed that the operation of the French revolution had no influence on their minds, as well as on the minds of men in other parts of Europe? The circumstances of that revolution may fairly be allowed to have tended to make them swerve from their alle-848giance, not as catholics, but as subject. Is there not also some allowance to be made for the connexion formed between the Roman catholics and the protestants of the north of Ireland, a people of enlightened minds, powerful from their talents and their industry? But the people of that part of Ireland, who are well known not to be much attached to the established church, considered the catholics to be like themselves, persecuted. The year 1798 opened new views, and to the union which was then formed between the protestants and the catholics ought the activity of the latter in the rebellion to be in some degree ascribed. There is also another little circumstance which ought not to be passed over, when it is attempted to he argued that nothing intervened between the concessions in the year 1793 and the rebellion. Did nothing happen during Lord Fitzwilliam's administration? Did that noble lord not conceive that he was acting the best for the peace of Ireland, by holding out to the catholics the hope of what they called their emancipation? Doubts have been entertained whether he was authorised by government to encourage such hopes: but that has nothing to do with the present question; that the expectation did exist, is a fact of the greatest importance. When that noble lord was recalled, whets a motion was. made on the subject in parliament, and negatived, the Roman catholics saw with grief the cup they had looked at with so much eagerness, suddenly dashed from their lips, at the moment they at last expected to enjoy it. Would not any man say, that if he were a catholic, this would have been to him a great cause of despondency? The history of the country showed the melancholy consequences of that disappointment; for it was not until after the recall of Lord Fitzwilliam, that a connexion began to be formed between kind and France: and there is every appearance that the disappointment then experienced by the Roman catholics, drove some of them into this connexion. We have been told, that it appears from certain inquiries made by the Irish parliament, that catholic emancipation and reform were not considered by the people in some parts of Ireland as of more value than a bit of paper or a drop of ink. I believe this may be the fact; but was it not also stated by the same persons, that, had these measures been granted, they were aware that they must have given up all hope of doing what they call good, but which we849call mischief? All those who wished to revolutionize Ireland were greatly alarmed during Lord Fitzwilliam's administration, and were perfectly convinced, that, if the measures to be proposed were carried, their intentions would be completely defeated. I have been told, that at the time of the union no distinct promise of redress was made to the Roman catholics, and I believe it. No minister could promise that which depended upon the determination of parliament. The right hon. gent. opposite to me could have done nothing more than promise to recommend their claims: but did not the catholics believe that through the measure of the union they would obtain complete redress? Did they not rely on the promised support of the right hon. gent.? It was on that ground they gave all their weight to the proposition of the union; and I know some who have felt less kindness to the catholics on that account. The persuasion was certainly general, that the catholic claims would be fully granted after the union, and a learned gentleman (Dr. Duigenan) now hostile to these claims appears to have promoted this persuasion. In a letter written by that learned gent. to an hon. friend of mine, whom I am happy to see a member of this house (Mr. Grattan), there is a paragraph, to this purport; \"if we were one people with the British nation, the preponderance of the protestant interest in the whole state would then be so great, that it would not be any longer necessary to curb the Roman catholics by any restraints whatever.\" Now when the Roman catholics found the opinion stated by the learned gent., who had been through the whole of his life against granting them redress, must they not have expected that the passing of the union was to be the signal for the redress of their grievances? In a printed speech, too, (printed in a way which might entitle it to be referred to as some authority) of a noble lord who once filled the chair of this house (lord Sidmouth), this passage of the learned gent.'s letter is referred to in support of the opinion, that no restraints would be necessary after the union. If, then, that noble lord drew this inference, what conclusion was it to be expected the Roman Catholics themselves should form? At that time, then, it appeared to be thought that the repeal of these laws would be a measure of safety to the British empire; and yet they remain in the same situation. I state not this as any reproach to the right hon. gent. opposite to me; but what must the850catholics think, when they find that those who most favoured the union, and who, on account of the measures then in contemplation, held up that event as eminently calculated to promote the well being and security of the British empire, opposed their hopes? What the circumstances were, which prevented this question being then brought forward, I shall not attempt to discuss, because I do not pretend to know them; but I must observe, that its delay might have led to the very worst consequences. The catholics, however, have shown by their conduct that they are guided by principles which merit the highest encomium. Their disappointment has not made them resort to popular clamour or tumult. They have brought forward their claims in the most constitutional manner, and they rely with confidence and respect on the justice of this house. The presenting of the present petition is a pledge of the propriety of their conduct; and though my motion should not this night be acceded to, they will still have gained something, by having an opportunity afforded them of stating their opinions. A great and respectable part of the people of the empire are now in favour of their claims. The people of England will soon be completely convinced of the propriety of granting them all they demand; and antiquated prejudices, which it is my lot to expose in 1805, and which were doubtful in 1669, will be completely done away.&#x2014;Hitherto I have said nothing of a kind of mysterious objection which has been lately started. I have been asked&#x2014;\"Why do you bring on this question when success is impossible?\" Another tells me, \"I like the measure as well as you; but why press it when there is no chance of success?\" Why, I know of no circumstance that should render it impossible to carry this question in this house; and there would at least be a little better chance of success, if all those gentlemen who are in favour of the measure would favour us with their votes. I have been told that the repeal of these laws is conceived to be contrary to his majesty's coronation oath. Now, sir, were I to propose any thing which would be a violation of his majesty's coronation oath, I should not only think myself a disloyal subject, but a dishonest man. But how absurd would it be to suppose that parliament, who made that oath for the king to take, should understand it to bind bins to refuse his assent to future acts which they might present to him! The oath, as framed by parliament, was admi-851nistered to king William, and statutes now proposed to be repealed were passed after he had taken the oath. Now, if it could be maintained that the oath has any reference at all to legislative measures, still I would ask, how can it affect acts passed after it was framed Such a doctrine appears to me calculated to produce the greatest confusion, and completely to overturn the constitution. If it were true, the government of this country would no longer be a mixed monarchy, but we should be in a mixed state of anarchy and confusion. But it is supposed that the coronation oath would be violated, because the effect of the measure now proposed would, it is said, be to overturn the church establishment of this country. These laws were, however, made against dissenters of all descriptions; and yet the church was not overturned by our union with the presbyterians of Scotland. Was the coronation oath made to bend in the one case, and not in the other? According to this new doctrine, Queen Anne must have broken her coronation oath when she consented to the union with Scotland, and his present majesty must already have violated his coronation oath more than once, when he sanctioned the acts passed in his reign for the relief of the Roman catholics. His majesty did not refuse his assent to these acts; on the contrary, he did what I am sure he always will do; he followed the advice of parliament, exercising at the same time his own judgment. While I glory in the name of an Englishman, I never can say that any thing which parliament thinks fit to be done. cannot be done. If it had been the practice that nothing was to be moved in this house, but such questions as gentlemen had a reasonable hope of carrying, the country would have been deprived of most of the laws which now constitute its greatest pride and boast; for the best measures have in general been at first strongly resisted, and have at last been rendered ultimately successful by the perseverance of those who introduced them, and the good sense of parliament. But I never can believe that any branch of of our constitution will forget its duty; and I am sorry that the report of an opinion having been given on this subject, should be circulated&#x2014;said to be given, too, by one who has a legislative voice, but who has no right to pronounce any opinion on matters pending in this house. His majesty's lawful authority is one of the corner stones of the constitution; but while I shall always exert myself to support that lawful authority, I852cannot be silent when I see interested persons endeavouring to extend that influence beyond its due bounds. It would be a great and incalculable evil, were it to be established as a maxim in this house, than no person must move any measure, however great its benefits might be, if it were once whispered about, that it could not be successful, because another branch of the constitution was hostile to it. I could wish to see any sacrifice made for the gratification of the crown, except the sacrifice of the welfare and security of the country. The man who countenances such a sacrifice is not a loyal subject; is not one who loves his king, but one who flatters him in order to betray him.&#x2014;Having now troubled the house at so much length, I shall only briefly state a few of the minor points which the subject presents. There may be some persons who would not wish to repeal the whole of the restraints upon the Roman catholics, but who would wish to do away a part: I should therefore expect, that all who view the question in this way will concur with me in voting to refer the petition to a committee, in order to discover what part of the laws it may be fit to repeal. Among these minor points will also fall to be considered the situation of the army. A catholic may serve in the king's army in Ireland; he may arrive to the rank of a general, but not a general on the staff! If, however, he comes to England, he is liable to pains and penalties on account of his religion. Surely those who would resist the question in the whole, must at least allow that this is a case in which some relief ought to be given. I am also assured that the common soldiers are restrained from the exercise of their religion sometimes in Ireland; but almost always in England. Some alteration is also necessary in the law of marriage. I mention these circumstances as forming parts of the question which ought to induce such persons as think them worthy of redress, to go into a committee, whatever their objections to the general question may be. I have stated, that the disabilities under which the catholics suffer are of two sorts; namely, those which consist of restrictions on the king's prerogative, and those which restrain the choice of the people. I think that Roman catholics ought, like all the other subjects of his majesty, to be enabled to hold places under the crown, and to sit in parliament; but I understand there are some who would consent to a proposition for rendering them accessible to offices, but who853would not agree to give them seats in parliament. Those who entertain this opinion, surely cannot refuse to go into the committee. I understand there are others who, on the contrary, think it advisable that Roman catholics should be excluded from offices in the executive part of government; but that, on the ground of virtual representation, which I have stated, they ought to be admitted to seats in the house of commons. I own that I think this opinion the most rational of the two; and surely those who entertain it cannot object to the motion I am about to make. &#x2014;I have now stated most of the general ground on which I think the repeal of the laws complained of is advisable; and I shall now very briefly mention a few of the advantages which may be expected to result from such measure. A great proportion of the last and of the present session has been consumed in considering of the best means of recruiting the army, and of increasing our local and disposable force. Now, without disparaging the modes recommended by my right hon. friend (Mr. Windham) on this bench or the right hon. gent. opposite, for attaining this desirable object, I will venture to say, that no scheme whatever of parish recruiting, limited service, or militia volunteering, can equal the effect of this measure. All these schemes are tardy and trifling, compared to the prompt and large supply which would be afforded by Ireland, were the laws against the Roman catholic repealed. You now receive into your army Irish Roman catholic; but what might not be expected from the zeal and gratitude of a nation famed for warmth of temper and generosity, fondly exulting in a triumph obtained over illiberality and prejudice? All your other supplies would be little rivulets, compared to this great ocean of military resource. But you are not merely to consider the number, but also the nature of the circumstances under which you would obtain the recruits. Look at the situation of France, our formidable enemy; is she formidable for her finances, her naval power, her comerce, or any other resource except her population? It is from the disproportion of our population to her, that we can have any our population. Why then do we hesitate to adopt a measure which would afford us powerful a reinforcement. In this age foreign conquests have been less valued than they were in former times; but if conquests deserved to be ever so much esteemed, what854conquest ever could equal either the true glory or solid advantage of re-acquiring one-fourth of your population? What prospect can be more consolatory than that of thus adding to your strength that which cannot now be called a part of your strength, but may rather be named a part of your weakness? The protestant ascendancy had been compared to a garrison in Ireland. It is not in our power to add to the strength of this garrison, but I would convert the besiegers themselves into the garrison. How can you suppose that the four millions of men should feel themselves in the situation of the other twelve millions, which form the population on the British empire? They know that they furnish you with recruits, from whom you may with reluctance choose serjeants: they send you officers, but they know they can never rise to the rank of general. They supply you with sailors, who never can advance to any eminence in their profession. How different would our policy be, how different our situation in a military point of view, were the means I proposed adopted! There would be no differences, no discontents; but all the subject of the empire, enjoying equal rights, would join with one heart and one mind in its defence. I am sanguine in believing, that these equal rights and laws will be granted to the Roman catholics. I am even sanguine enough to believe, that many bad consequences which might be expected to result from a refusal of them, will not follow the rejection of this petition. I rely on the affection and loyalty of the Roman catholics of Ireland; but I would not press them too far, I would not draw the cord too tight. It is surely too much to expect that they will always fight for a constitution in the benefits of which they are not permitted to participate. No permanent advantage can arise from any measure, except that which shall restore them to the full enjoyment of equal rights with their fellow citizens. In the present situation of Europe, and when the designs of the enemy are considered, Ireland is a place where the active exertions of this country may be required; and this is one of the ground on which I am anxious that the motion I am about to propose should be acceded to. Whatever be the fate of the question, I am happy in having had this opportunity of bringing it under the consideration of the longer, but to move, \"that the petition be referred to the consideration of the committee of the whole house.\"", "author_id": "/people/mr-charles-fox-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1805", "may", "13"], "content": "&#x2014;My lords: in the course of this debate, the catholic hierarchy, the priests, the Catholic religion, have been treated with the most unqualified censure, and with an asperity which I little expected to find in this enlightened assembly. It is one of the misfortunes of the catholic cause, that, composing as they do the great mass of the indigent population of Ireland, they are liable to every misrepresentation; the crime of the individual becomes the offence of the sect; the highest man in the community is made answerable for the conduct of the lowest: the religion itself is censured for the commission of those very acts which it reprobates and condemns&#x2014;Many allusions have been made to the late Whatever that rebellion might have been, it765certainly was not in its origin a catholic war; the principal leaders were not catholics, Whose object it was to depress one religion, in order to elevate another. On the contrary, they aimed to destroy. every thing that had been established, every thing that had been held sacred. They declared themselves to be alike enemies to the purity of the protestant worship, and to what they called the superstition of the catholic faith; their intention was to extinguish the monarchy, to put an end to the connexion between Great Britain and Ireland, and in their room to erect a republic without a king, a priest, or a noble. The leaders of that rebellion were certainly too able not to have taken advantage of any circumstance which might have led in the most remote degree to weaken the government, and to render their cause triumphant. They consequently appealed to every bad passion, to every malignant feeling of the human heart. It is impossible that any contest can take place in Ireland, into which, the bitterness and poison of religious and sectarian prejudices will not enter: all men who entertain views inimical to the public peace, would naturally seize every occasion to increase those dissensions. It is to be lamented that these arts sometimes operate on the minds of the low, ignorant, and vulgar part of the catholic community; but One, cannot be at all surprised when we reflect that the protestant, though generally of a higher class, and much better educated and informed, was too often the dupe of these artifices, and suffered his mind to be biassed, his understanding controuled and his generous feelings warped by the existence of those very prejudices of Which he so loudly complained.&#x2014;It is impossible to pass over in silence many things which have fallen from noble lords in this debate, without an endeavour to rescue the character of my country and my countrymen from aspersions which, had they been Uttered in any other place,I should not have hesitated to have called most unfounded calumnies. As long as there was a resident parliament in Ireland, it was the ignoble policy, the wretched practice of the representatives of the people to libel and malign their constituents. I am sorry to see such conduct imitated here. It was the strongest argument in favour of the union, that an appeal was made from. the passions and prejudices of a little country to the temper, the moderation, the cool and deliberate wisdom of a great nation. Miserable indeed is the situation of Ireland, hopeless and without766relief are her circumstance, if this her found expectation, her last, her only remaining refuge is to be disappointed; if by so many sacrifices she has only obtained the dearly bought permission of displaying her miseries on a more extended theatre, where the errors, the misfortunes, the crimes of Ireland are to be re-echoed from one house of parliament to the other, in order to give them publicity to Europe, and that, in future, no foreigner should doubt how weak and vulnerable the empire is in that quarter! Do not, I beseech you, my lords, believe that the Irish are a nation of degraded beings, insensible to the blessings of law, order, and government. There is neither candour nor justice in estimating the character of a whole people by the standard of the conduct of a few atrocious criminals, by excesses committed in moments of heat, irritation, and civil war. By this mode of reasoning, the whole of the French nation would be made answerable for the infuriate and sanguinary spirit which governed and disgraced for years of the revolution the populace of Paris. The virtues of the inhabitants of Ireland, and they do possess virtues, belong at least to themselves, and are peculiarly their own: their faults are the faults of their situation, and of the calamities which have too often distracted and oppressed their unhappy country. The frequent changes of property during the seventeenth century, the persecuting code of the eighteenth, the marked line of separation between the old inhabitants and the new, have established distinctions which nor time, nor circumstances, nor christian charity, nor political necessity have yet been able to remove. It appeared to be the wish of the legislature to create two distinct and separate nations, possessing separate and distinct interests. Unhappily they succeeded but too well&#x2014;violence will beget violence&#x2014;oppression will create resistance. When one part of the community enjoys a free constitution, and the other is in chains, the natural consequences must be, that the governors will acquire a spirit of domination incompatible with every degree of equal liberty; and the governed a spirit of licentiousness and resistance, little reconcileable to law and subordination. This has been the state of Ireland; it is not however the ordinance of the Almighty, but the policy of man. None of those libellers of their country will maintain that it was preordained that man in Ireland was to be indolent, ferocious and savage, and in England civilized and industrious. Seek for the effects ari-767sing from human conduct, in human cause. Persecution may have been driven from the walls of parliament, but it has entered into the privacies of domestic life, poisoning the sources of social enjoyment, diffusing dissension and not union, discord and not charity, widening instead of closing the breach between the protestant who conceded with regret, and the catholic who consequently received without gratitude. The legislature appeared to have advanced in vain, the public mind was retrograde, liberality, was in the mouths of all, but persecution and rancour were in the hearts of many; the effects of the abominable code of popery laws, survived the code itself; the extent of mischief it had occasioned was not discovered till those laws had ceased in a great measure to exist. What now remains to be granted only insults the catholic without securing the protestant. How the state would be endangered because a catholic peer might sit in parliament, or a catholic gentleman enjoy any office or represent any county in which he had a large property, I am at a loss to imagine, particularly when the peerage who have the choice, the government who have the disposal of office, the property who have the influence in elections, would still continue protestant. The virtues of men, or the effects arising from their virtues, are transitory and perishable, why therefore should their follies and their, prejudices be immortal? Why should religious hatred last for ever? It is certainly a created and not a natural cause of difference. He who believes in transubstantiation and he who rejects it, may certainly think alike on other subjects, and be governed by motives equally pure and honourable as men, as citizens, as Christians. The protestant may rejoice in the superior purity of his religion, and lament the darkness which overshadows the mind of his catholic brother: but surely it is not necessary that matters of conscience or of speculative belief should interfere with the active conduct of either. Every relaxation of the penal code has been opposed by the same Arguments, which have been again and again answered and refuted. I beg pardon&#x2014;truth and candour oblige me to confess that in the list of charges and accusations, the pretender has lately been omitted; but the power of the pope, whether he be the prisoner of the directory, or the slave of Buonapart&#x00E9;, whether he vegetate at Rome or be in chains at Paris, is still alike formidable and portentous. The protestant property is still in danger, though that property has been in768their hands for five generations; the families of the original claimants are generally extinct, or resident in foreign countries and a considerable number of catholics have purchased and hold their property under the act of settlement and explanation.&#x2014;A noble viscount has thought it right to assert, that registry of the forfeited property was in the possession of the families of the ancient proprietors. In all the heat and agitation of debate which has taken place in the Irish parliament on this subject, I never before heard the accusation seriously maintained. If such a record there be, I challenge the noble viscount to produce it&#x2014;where is it kept? in what families does it exist? The noble viscount also made an implied panegyric on the penal code, when he asserted that during its existence in full force, Ireland enjoyed an uninterrupted state of tranquillity and peace. At this auspicious and vaunted period all the rights of Ireland were invaded, her commerce could hardly be said to exist, her principal manufacture was annihilated, her constitution was subverted, her population was reduced to twelve hundred thousand. This might be peace, but it was the repose of desolation, the tranquillity of a jail, undisturbed by any sounds but the rattling of chains. The protestant was a despot, the catholic was a slave; the protestant surrendered his liberty that he might enjoy his tyranny, the catholic abandoned his country to seek for bread, and found renown in every service of Europe.&#x2014;I must complain of the want of candour, I must lament the infatuation which prevails on this delicate subject. I am sorry to see the belief of the catholics estimated, not by their own professions and declarations, but by the charges and accusations of their enemies, whom no denial will silence, no test will satisfy. The catholics of the nineteenth century are to be judged and doomed to perpetual exclusion for doctrines and opinions which they renounce, abjure, and abhor, but which Were formerly held in remote ages by, the bigoted zealots of popery before the dawn of reason, truth, or philosophy had purified religion, and broken through the clouds of superstition. The fate of those who profess the catholic religion in these kingdoms has been rather singular; in the last century, they were proscribed for holding opinions subversive of liberty, and for loving monarchy too much&#x2014;in this they have been accused of loving it too little, and of changing their doctrines of high prerogative, passive, obedience, and divine, inde-769feasible, hereditary right, for wild fantastic, mischievous notions of republican liberty and equality. These contradictory charges against the religion of the most numerous body of the Christians of Europe are neither wise, liberal, or founded. Catholicity has been the faith of some of the most illustrious nations, and the belief of many individuals who have done honour to the name of man. Notwithstanding this acknowledged truth which bigotry itself will not venture to deny, how often has it been insinuated that they cannot be good subjects to a protestant king, because they are not bound by oaths? This mischievous opinion has been sustained with vulgar and mischievous asperity. If it were true, why are the petitioners at your bar? Nothing but their regard for the sanctity of an oath, nothing but the restraints imposed upon them by conscience, obliges them to submit to the various disabilities of which they complain. I certainly despair of carrying this question now, but at the same time I am convinced, that it will hereafter be found absolutely necessary to comply with the prayer of the petitioners; for believe me there is discontent: danger does exist in Ireland, the amount or extent no man can tell. Suffer not therefore the majority of the inhabitants to remain longer under any disabilities; take away every pretence for disaffection, and try a system of conciliation and concession. Procrastination is the fool's resource: policy, state necessity, the situation of Ireland, the willing or unwilling submission of the continent of Europe to the power of France, all demand this measure. What must be done sooner or later had better be done now: what will assuredly be granted, had better be given with the best possible grace, I am sure it is necessary to repeal those laws in order to lay the basis of the future tranquillity of Ireland. After so many ages of wretchedness, confusion and blood, of degradation without, and smothered war within, a final settlement and peace is required; a real, solid, founded, substantial peace, not an empty, hollow, treacherous truce[...], a settlement which would give security at home, and respectability abroad, which would be the commencement of a new &#x00E6;ra in Ireland, when every man might forget the prejudices of a sectarian, and recollect the duties of a citizen. All the power, all energy, all the exertion of a happy and united people might be brought to the assistance of your threatened empire. That which constitutes your present weakness, would become your future strength;770where you are now vulnerable you would hereafter be invincible, Six centuries have elapsed since the English first appeared in Ireland. Whether that country was or was not conquered, I shall not stop to enquire; to be informed, it is not necessary to open the page of history. All the rugged shapeless features of conquest are too visible everywhere. A mile from a great town every shape and semblance of England vanishes. Religion, language, manners, habits, not only distinct, but opposite; the great charter of liberty suspended; the law inoperative party violence tearing asunder every Christian charity, every endearing connexion the protestant in his wrath seeking for his lately emancipated slave; and too many of the lower class of men, in their despair, willing to trample on their allegiance: such is the faint outline of a most disgusting picture, such the state of a country inhabited by a brave, active, intelligent race of men, blessed with some of the power, population, wealth, and strength, amidst the bitterness of religious acrimony, popular delusion, and lurking rebellion. No stronger proof can be given of the natural and inherent energies of a country which has still flourished and prospered, notwithstanding the miserable system which has been pursued, and the vicious administration of the government. Ireland is the only country in the world, where it was thought necessary to proscribe by law a great majority of the inhabitants, where the parliament legislated not for the people, but against the people. I voted for the union with a firm conviction, with an assured hope, that it would for[...]if the connexion between Great Britain and Ireland, heal the wounds of a distracted country, and ensure the future adoption of the catholic body. I voted with that doubt, hesitation, and reluctance, which every man must experience, who, in the triumph of duties over affections, ventures to shock the feelings, the passions, the honest prejudices of his country. I know that I adopted a hazardous experiment. I know that I differed from some of the best and wisest men in Ireland. I am sure, at the time, it was my honest, genuine, unbiassed sentiment. Possibly I might have despaired too soon; oppressed by a sense of present evil, I fondly, perhaps vainly imagined, that nothing would tend so much to stifle jealousies, to allay the restless, ferocious, sanguinary spirit of intolerance, to subdue the fears or the loyal, and the hopes of the disaffected. I may have been mistaken; if such has been771my misfortune, I have much to lament, and something to atone for; but the act is done I was one of those who surrendered for ever the legislative independence of my Country. During the discussion of the question, many persons of the best intentions, who had before opposed the claims of the catholics, declared that, after the adoption of that measure, they could see no objection to the repeal of every remaining disability. I therefore entertained a sanguine hope that tardy justice would at length have been rendered to this numerous and deserving body of men, and that the adoption of the catholic body would have consummated and confirmed the union. If, on the contrary, you are only corrupted by our example, and adopt the same prejudices which have so long agitated and distracted Ireland, the union will be no relief to her misfortunes: it may be an union by act of parliament, but it is not an union of interests and affections; it is a settlement which has given dissatisfaction to great bodies of men, without having hitherto afforded contentment to any. The noble lord concluded by reading several extracts from lord Redesdale's speech of the night before; he contradicted many of the assertions of that noble lord, and called upon the Irish peers to rise in their places and vindicate the Irish nation from aspersions highly injurious to their honour, and which tended to degrade that country from the rank of civilized nations.", "author_id": "/people/mr-john-hutchinson-3", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},

He was not induced by what had fallen from the noble lord to retract an assertion which he had made on the former evening of debate. He asserted, in confirmation of what he then stated, that, from the prejudices of the catholics in Ireland, it was extremely difficult to put protestant children out to service. (A cry of no! no!) He knew the fact, he said, from his official situation in Ireland, where being a trustee for several charitable institutions he knew that the greatest embarrassment arose from the extreme difficulty Which existed of putting out protestant children from those institutions to service. It was also equally true that the greatest prejudice existed in catholic families against protestant servants, and that every means were used to render their situation uncomfortable (A cry of no! no! from some noble lords, and of order! from others.) He was not, he said, to be driven from any772of his assertions by any contradiction of that nature; he repeated that his assertions were correct, and referred in still further support of them to Mr. M'Kenna's pamphlet, an authority which he did not think would be disputed. On the former evening he had likewise referred to the catholic hierarchy of Ireland, and he now maintained that that hierarchy existed in defiance of the law of the land, the persons who now bald the dignities of that hierarchy being the successors of those whose offices the law had declared should be abolished.", "author_id": "/people/mr-john-freeman-mitford-1", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},
{"date": ["1805", "may", "13"], "content": "said, he had no scruple in giving it as his opinion that the existence and full security of the established church was in no way involved in this measure, that whenever it was adopted there could be no possible ground for thinking of repealing any part of the act of settlement, or, as had been mentioned, the 5th article of the act of union; that he fully approved of the terms of the petition on the table; that he saw with satisfaction the reasonable and moderate principles entertained by those on whose part it had been presented; and that he had no doubt that in due time and at a fit opportunity their claims would have their proper weight with all who valued the principles the British constitution, and who in consequence wished that its blessings should be perpetuated and extended. He argued that though vulgar outcry and popular clamour should never influence the conduct of that house, yet it could not be maintained that their lordships, in their decisions, were to be deaf or insensible to what they be, lieved to be the general sentiment and opinion of the large body of the public. He believed that that sentiment was at present de-774cidedly hostile to the measure; he did not rely merely upon the adverse petitions upon the table, but upon the notoriety of the fact he believed that if the motion was adopted, a degree of uneasiness and discontent would arise to which no one could be able to look without apprehension and anxiety as to the consequence. He did not, however, look to the continued duration of such sentiments, but spoke only as to their present existence. He objected further to the motion of the noble lord, as its object was single and separate: it went merely to take into consideration the subject matter of the petition, with the avowed view of granting the concessions in question. Those concessions ought at no time to be made without connecting other matters with them. A noble and learned Lord (Redesdale), who had just spoken in explanation, had stated that the Irish Roman catholic hierarchy existed contrary to the law: if that was the case, he inferred that the law not being enforced resulted from prudential considerations, and that it might possibly be found upon a general settlement that the catholics might also have concessions to make. How absurd therefore would it be in their lordships thus immediately and hastily to make these concessions, and thereby limit the means and increase the difficulties of a final arrangement and settlement at a future opportunity? He thought that the Irish Roman catholics publicly and ordinarily calling themselves by titles and appellations which by the law of the land belonged to others was very offensive to the law. Perhaps, in any attempt to come to an amicable settlement of existing differences, they might agree to discontinue or moderate such practice; perhaps. in such an arrangement they would consent to have their bishops nominated by his majesty, a measure in his mind eminently calculated to connect the catholic body with the government; and to give to each a common interest and a common feeling, and to remedy many existing evils. This, however, would be a concession on the part of the catholics, and, one perhaps which they might not be disposed to make, if we should thus in the first instance have inconsiderately granted all that they require us to concede to them. He doubted much whether the great body of the Irish Roman catholics had really wished this question now to have been brought on. Mr. M'Kenna, an Irish Roman catholic writer of much celebrity, whose opinions could not but have much weight with his brethren, unequivocally expressed in a recent publication his wish that775the matter should have been entirely left to parliament. He had also intimated an idea that conscientious doubts and difficulties prevailed upon this subject in the mind of the first authority in the state; and had expressed himself with great sensibility upon that point. He would not pretend to say how far such doubts and difficulties might or might not be founded: but if such feeling and such sensibility could pervade the breasts of Irishmen (who were more distant from the seat of government) and catholics, they could not be strange to the minds of Englishmen and protestants; and if their lordships should experience them, they could not but afford an additional inducement for pausing in the present proceeding. Having always felt an ardent desire that this question should receive an impartial and a favourable discussion, he could not but lament what he felt to be its premature introduction. He feared that it might give a check to opinion, and betray individuals into an hasty expression of a hostile sentiment, to which at a future time, for the sake of consistency, they might think it necessary to adhere. It was a matter of satisfaction to him to think that he had been preceded nearly in the same line of opinion and conduct by two of his Majesty's ministers (Camden and Mulgrave).&#x2014; He was aware that such a line of conduct might he liable to observation in debate, but he nevertheless flattered himself that it might not be unattended with advantage. He thought that it would be a matter of satisfaction to the respectable body from whom the petition came to know that they had friends on both sides of the division, and that the numbers who divided for the motion of the noble lord did not constitute the whole of their strength; but he hoped that knowledge would not lead them hastily and prematurely to reintroduce the subject; and that the dignified and temperate discussion which the question had received, and particularly the temper and moderation of the reverend bench, would operate as an inducement to such forbearance.", "author_id": "/people/mr-john-parker-3", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},
{"date": ["1805", "may", "13"], "content": "&#x2014;My lords, it is not my purpose to go any great length into argument upon the question before you. I rise principally with a view to offer some observations in answer to a noble and learned lord who holds a high situation in Ireland, and whose speech in this debate, I own, creates in my mind no small share of astonishment. It has been well observed by other noble lords, that whatever comes from his elevated authority on a subject wherein it ought to be presumed, at least, he is well informed, must have much weight in this house. Looking to his grave character, and that liberality of sentiment which I expected would have raised his mind far above the vulgar prejudices and idle tales that have filled narrow minds upon this topic, I hoped from him, that whatever might be his sentiments upon the motion before you, they would at least have been delivered with that calmness, moderation, and sound argument, that one would expect to characterise the expanded mind, extensive knowledge, just discernment, and strict impartiality benefiting his high judicial situation, in a coun-779try where he forms so important a member of the government, and presides over the administration of justice. But, my lords, how great was my astonishment to find the noble lord, not only opposing the motion with a degree of heat and acrimony little becoming his gravity, but conjuring up the most abominable arguments to support his opposition. Where the noble and learned lord has found his authority for such arguments, and so totally opposite to those sentiments by which lie has heretofore been actuated, I am at a loss to account. Upon a former occasion, that noble lord manifested the most liberal zeal in favour of the catholics of this country, and used such exertions to obtain a relaxation of the penal laws, in their favour, as to procure for himself the warmest thanks of those whose cause he has espoused. But such seems the strange bias, I will not call it the prejudice, of his mind against the catholics of another country, that, in order to mark still stronger his dispraise towards those of Ireland, he is lavish in his encomiums upon those of England, and tells us, that the only distinctive characteristics between the protestants and catholics of his acquaintance or neighbourhood in this country, was, that the latter were always the most exemplary, and best conducted men in the parish where they lived. But what is the noble and learned lord's chief accusation against the catholics of Ireland? Why, that they have bishops, by whose guidance their conduct is influenced; and that those bishops have gone the length of calling the right reverend prelate of Armagh, plain Dr. Stuart. But though the noble and learned lord arraigns with so, much stress the contumacy of this circumstance, I hardly think the right reverend prelate himself would lay so much stress upon it, or consider it as any infraction of his archiepiscopal rank or diocesan authority. The noble and learned lord has said, that no protestant dares appear in certain parts of Ireland. This, I am afraid, was too much the case in some parts of that country during the furor of the late rebellion. I have heard much the same thing stated by another gentleman; but he said, it was no matter of what religion a man was,if he was but known to the rebels to be a loyal Man; for that was the criterion upon which their fury was directed, against men of all sects. This, however, is no argument against the catholics as such, but merely a proof of the barbarism of the lower orders, which I lament, and only blame the government which has presided in the country, not having taken more pains to educate780and civilize them. The noble lord next goes to domestic affairs; and he complains of religious antipathies borne by catholic to protestant servants. Some remedy we are told is necessary; but what does the noble lord propose? Not to re-enact the penal laws; not to accede to the petition; but to abolish the catholic hierarchy! and this is the remedy which the noble and learned lord supposes would strike at the root of the evil. I confess, my lords, the expedient does not carry the same weight in my estimation. But those things, which to the minds of other men appear insurmountable difficulties, to the enlightened understanding, and profound discernment of the noble lord, are no difficulties at all. Three hundred years have elapsed since the reformation, which, aided by all the rigours of the penal code, has yet been so unsuccessful in Ireland, that still above three-fourths of the population continues catholic. The Irish papists, it seems, according to the noble lord, do not understand English; but, from the nature of their education, they are better acquainted with Latin; therefore, says the noble lord, you have nothing to do but translate the bible and church liturgy into Irish, and preach the reformed religion in that language, as has been done in Wales, and you at once convert the whole country into protestants. Here again, I own, that I much doubt the success of the noble lord's project; for, though you might find an Irish congregation to understand, I fancy you would find it rather difficult to find protestant clergymen to preach or pray in that tongue. But it is said, if you grant this measure to the catholics, you will have the presbyterians and all the different sects of dissenters claiming similar indulgence. My lords, if it be just and politic to grant the claims of the catholics, I cannot see why you should refuse, them, because others may claim something else afterwards. If the catholics are quiet, it is said, give them nothing, they do not ask for any thing; and if they do ask, it is said, give them nothing, for they are turbulent. It is always too soon or too late to hearken to their petitions. The periods of peace or war are equally unpropitious to their hopes. Some noble lords emphatically resist this petition because it is brought forward at this time; who tell us, in the same breath, that they think it proper at no time, and will resist it at any But, my lords, own I am utterly at a loss for arguments to meet such contradictory objections as these. But then comes the grand objection Of all:&#x2014;Not satisfied with781the loyal conduct and peaceful demeanour of the catholic body in Ireland, you still question their sincerity. You propose to them test after test, and oath after oath, to prove their loyaly and attachment to the state; and after they have taken those tests, and given the most solemn assurances you could demand, it is then said, they are not to be believed upon their oaths, as it is a fundamental article of their religion, that no faith is to be kept with heretics; and that the pope may absolve them from allegiance to a protestant king. Now, my lords, if this were really the case, how can we account for the reluctance of the catholics to take the only oath that stands between them and all they wish? Is it fair to admit such a charge against them from their enemies, which they have repeatedly, and in the most solemn manner disavowed and abjured? But, my lords, I will refer to better authority than the assertions of their enemies; namely, to the authority of the most eminent catholic universities in Europe, for their opinions upon those points, obtained at the special instance of a right honourable gentleman at the head of his majesty's councils in the year 1789. I speak of the universities of the Sorbonne, Louvain, Doway, Alcala, Valladolid, and Salamanca; all of whom solemnly deny such doctrines, and complain of nothing more bitterly than the calumnies of their opponents upon this head. My lords, the question propounded for the answers of those several universities, were three, which I shall read to your lordships:&#x2014;Has the pope or cardinals, or any body of men, or any individuals of the church of Rome, any civil or political authority, power, jurisdiction, or pre-eminence whatsoever, within the realm of England? Can the pope or cardinals, or any body of men, or any Individuals of the church of Rome, absolve or dispense with his majesty's subjects from their oath of allegiance, upon any pretext whatsoever? Is there any principle in the catholic faith by which catholics are justified in not keeping faith with heretics, or other persons differing from them in religious opinions, in any transactions of a public or private nature?&#x2014;My lords, these several queries have been answered by those several universities at considerable length, and decidedly its the negative&#x2014;The faculty of divinity at Louvain answer, that they are struck with astonishment that such questions should, at the end of this eighteenth century, be proposed to any learned body, by inhabitants of a kingdom that glories in the talents and discernment of its natives.\" The782first and second queries they answer unanimously in the negative; and they do not feel it incumbent on them to enter upon the proofs of the opinions which they hold, supported by the Holy Scriptures and the most eminent writers of their religion, ancient and modern, against the doctrines of Bellarmine, Du Perron, and many others, which they deeply lament, were favourably heard by the court of Rome in the dark ages, and even found its way into the councils of kings, to the production of infinite detriment to the church and republic of christianity, and the deluging of Europe with blood; they totally and utterly deny that any such power whatever exists in the catholic church, or its members, individually or collectively, pope, cardinal, council, or general assembly, to deprive any sovereign power of its temporal right, possession, government, jurisdiction, or pre-eminence, or subject it to any restraints or modifications; and that this opinion they hold, as founded in the doctrine of truth, of the apostles, and of the church,delivered down from the fathers and prelates; and though defaced and obscured by the filth heaped upon it in the middle ages, yet not obliterated. They state that this opinion is not peculiar to themselves, but that there is no society or learned body, nor any one learned man in the whole catholic world, who is not ready to subscribe to it with both hands: and, with respect to the third point, the faculty, after professing equal astonishment that such a question should be propounded, do most positively and unequivocally answer, that there is not and that there never has been, amongst the catholics, or in the doctrines of the church of Rome, any law, principle, or tenet which makes it lawful for catholics to break their faith with heretics, or others of a different persuasion from themselves in matters of religion, either in public or private concerns; and they quote the authority of an illustrious member of their faculty two centuries ago, that such a doctrine is most impious and pestilential, ascribed to the catholics by those men who, rather than peace should be made with them wished to throw every thing into confusion, and thus no harmony, no articles of peace, of equity, or honesty might be received by persons differing from them in religious matters.&#x2014;To the same questions the answers of all the other five universities I have named, are, in effect, precisely the same; all solemnly and utterly denying and abjuring such abominable tenets. Considering, therefore, the authority of those universities, as to what are or are not the783tenets and doctrines of their own religion, infinitely better than of those who ignorantly assert the contrary, unsupported by any authentic proof, I own I cannot feel with those who are for rejecting the claims of the catholics to those eligibilities which, it is even alleged, can gain them nothing. In this advanced stage of the Christian religion and of social civilization, I hold it to be highly essential to the happiness, the security, and the prosperity of this united empire, to do away all differences between his majesty's subjects, founded on distinctions in religion; and, notwithstanding what has fallen from the right reverend prelate who spoke last, and to whose authority I certainly feel disposed to pay every respect, yet I cannot feel with him that there is any danger to the protestant establishment from the vote I shall this night give, in favour of the motion for going into the committee.", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-keppel", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},

{"date": ["1805", "may", "13"], "content": "said, the anxiety and alarm which, during the long suspended agitation of this important question, had been excited in his mind as to its probable effect on the peace and tranquillity of the country, had from various indications of the public sentiment respecting it, in a great measure subsided, before the immediate discussion of the question in that house; and, from the circumstances immediately attending the discussion itself, which (except805during a short and painful in the course of that evening)had been uniformly temperate and decorous, and such as became the wisdom and gravity parliament, his alarm and anxiety had now wholly ceased. That he was convinced that the debates on this momentuous subject would, when known, be as satisfactory in the result to those whose rights and interests were the object of the debates, as they were honourable to those by whom they were conducted. If the question were to be brought forward at all,which he once regretted, but now rejoiced had been the case, he was happy that the claims of the Roman catholics had been put under the protection of the eminent person by whom they had been so ably and strenuously contended for in that house. That the Roman catholics must be convinced that they had a sincere and zealous, as the house was witness that they had a most powerful and consummate, advocate in the person of the noble lord. With a view to the quieting of the question at present, and the preventing its recurrence at any future period, it was well that the defence of the Roman catholic claims had been entrusted upon this occasion to no feebler arm; what had failed now was not likely to be advanced with equal energy and effect, and with better hopes of success, at any future period. He then said that, in the vote he was about to give upon the question then under consideration, and in the reasons he was about to offer to their lordships' for that vote, he trusted that no person would be so uncandid as to suppose that he was either an enemy to the full and free toleration of the religious opinions and Worship of his Roman catholic brethren in Ireland in the most extended sense of that word, or averse to those indulgence, in respect of civil rights, which had in a large and liberal measure been afforded them by parliament during the last twenty or twenty-five years of the present reign; although perhaps he might at the time have paused ta little upon the prudence and expediency of granting some of the particulars that had been granted; viz. the elective franchise, and a capacity of being included in the commission of the peace; that he did not repine however at any thing which had been hitherto done in their favour, much less wished that any part should now be recalled or withdrawn. I believe indeed, said his lordship, that no such wish exists in the minds of any of your lordships. I am sure it does not in the minds of my noble friends Against whom an insinuation of this kind806was directed in the heat and eagerness of debate on a former night. What our Roman catholic brethren have acquired by the liberal grant of a bestowing and confiding parliament, let them, under the solemn faith of parliament pledged to them for its continuance, still enjoy. I will not anticipate a possibility that a breach of the implied condition which is annexed to every legislative provision for the benefit of individuals, should draw the expediency of its allowed continuance into question at any the remotest period of our future history. The question now before us on this petition, is not a question of toleration in the enjoyment and exercise of civil and religious rights, but of the grant of political power. All that toleration can require in respect to civil and religious immunity, has been long ago satisfied in its most enlarged extent. At the commencement of the gracious and beneficent reign of his present Majesty, the Roman catholics of both parts of the united kingdom, especially of Ireland, were incumbered and weighed down by the grievous pressure of many rigorous restraints, penalties and disabilities. It become the wisdom of parliament (for on such subjects generosity and wisdom are the same,)to emancipate them from these burthens; and by several successive statutes in the space of about fifteen years they have been accordingly so emancipated. They are in respect of property capable inheriting and taking by devise for their own benefit, and of alienating and disposing of property in all such ways as it is competent to any other of his Majesty's to subjects to take and dispose of the same The education of their children, and the choice of their marriages are equally unrestrained to them. The enjoyment of their religious worships is equally free and public. The avenues to emolument and eminence in the practice and profession of the law are equally open to them with their protestant fellow subjects. The right of serving on grand and petit juries, and upon all inquests civil and criminal, is the same to them as to others. The right of voting in counties for members of parliament has been conferred on them; a capacity to become justice of the peace is capable of being communicated to them by his Majesty's commission of the peace in the same manner as it is to other subjects; that is, of course, under the check and control of a sound discretion to be exercised on the part of the person holding the great seal, as to the objects to which it should be granted.807All military and naval commissions, except those of principal command, and all offices except a very few of the great offices of state, and the higher judicial offices, are attainable by them. If, in the beginning of the year 1778, any person had ventured to predict to them, that such would in the course of a very few years be the condition of a people then labouring under the restraints, penalties, and disabilities, I have alluded to, he would have been regarded as a rash and hardly utterer of a vain prophecy, which had not the remotest chance of ever being accomplished. However, in the compass of fifteen years, by the gradual removal of civil and religious, and of some political restraints, they have attained the accomplishment of all which, in their relative situation to the establishments of the country, they can consistently ask, or we can, with due regard to our situation as trustees for them and others, consistently bestow. Their emancipation from civil and religious restraint as affecting themselves, and the rights to be enjoyed by them individually, is entire and complete; if it be not so, let it be shewn wherein it is in any instance defective, that the defect may be, if practicable, instantly supplied and remedied. Of the condition of the catholics as his Majesty found it al the commencement of his reign, loaded with the sufferings and the fears of former times had cast upon them, and as he will hand it over to succeeding times, it may be truly said \"Lateritiam invenit, marmoream reliquit.\" Catholicemancipation, as it is improperly called, if that term is meant to denote and designate any slavish subjection as still subsisting on their part profession of religious faith, or the exercise of religious worship has been fully attained. The only remaining emancipation which they are capable of receiving must be acquired by an act of their own, be redeeming themselves from the foreign bondage and thraldom under which they and their ancestors have long unworthily groaned, and from which the state, as it has neither imposed nor continued it, has no adequate means of relieving them consistently with the duty of self-preservation which it owes to itself. Every state claiming and exercising independent powers of sovereignty, has incidentally belonging to it, as such, the power of binding its subjects by laws of its own, not only paramount to, but exclusive of any authority or control to be exercised by any other state whatsoever. In so fat as any other state or person is al-808lowed to exercise an authority breaking in upon this exclusive nd independent power of legislation and enforcement of authority in one state, to that extent such state so intrenched upon is not sovereign and independent, but admits itself to be subordinate to, and dependent upon the other. The declaration contained in the oath of supremacy, which expresses a denial and renunciation of the existence of any power and authority in respect of ecclesiastical and spiritual matters in any foreign state, potentate, or person whatsoever, is but the affirmance of a preposition which is logically and politically true as an essential principle not to this government only, but to every other government under the sun which claims to possess and exercise the powers of independent sovereignty. It is not only true as a maxim of government, but essentially necessary to be insisted and acted upon, also, in all cases in obedience may become questionable, in order to give the state that assurance and test which it has a right to require and receive from its subjects, of their entire submission and fidelity in all matters to which the power and authority of the state can extend. But, it is said, that what is prayed by this petition is not a matter which impugns the authority of the state in matters to which its authority extends. That the reserve made by our Roman catholic brethren is only in favour of matters which concern God and their own consciences; matters of mere abstract faith, and mental persuasion. That however is not so; the pope, in virtue of his general spiritual authority, claims anthority in matters of mere faith; he claims and habitually exercises on some subjects a power of dispensing with oaths, and in that respect of nullifying all human sanctions whatsoever, as far as they affect the conscience through the medium of oaths; he claims and exercises by himself, and delegates to others, and effectual, or supposed effectual, power of absolution. What fatal effects the power, as exercised by the Roman catholic priesthood and applied to a credulous multitude, is capable of producing upon the civil and political condition of that community in which it is allowed to prevail, let the recent experience of Ireland during the late rebellion attest, where wretches, reeking with the blood of their murdered countrymen, have been purified from the guilt of past atrocities, and prepared for the com-809mission of new, by the all-atoning virtues of popish absolution; such a power as this over the conscience, engrosses and directs more than half the faculties and energy of the entire man, &c.;&#x2014;But, besides the spiritual power thus capable of being, and thus being in fact abused, the ecclesiastical power of the church of Rome over its obedient sons is enormous. It establishes and sustains in the instance of Ireland, an hierarchy dependant on the see of Rome as to the original nomination and subsequent control of its bishops and pastors, through the medium of which it enforces an obedience not in matters of faith only, but in temporal acts and concerns immediately connected with the duties and habits of ordinary life; not only in the payment of money for the maintenance of the local ecclesiastical establishment, or for such other purposes connected with their political economy as may be thought fit by the same authority to be enjoined, but in the performance also of rites and ceremonies, particularly that of marriage, form which all civil rites originate, and which they enjoin to be performed by their own ministers exclusively, thereby ousting the law of the land, and endangering or destroying the legitimacy of its subjects, and all rights of descent, inheritance, and representation founded thereon. The power of excommunication is, in the hands of their clergy, a most powerful and dangerous engine, not of spiritual and ecclesiastical only, but of temporal power. it acts at once upon all the comforts of domestic and social life in this world, and upon all the hopes and expectations of happiness in that which is to come. With what harshness and rigour, and with what daring defiance of the established law of the land, this most operative power of interdiction has been recently applied, not to a few individuals only, but to large multitudes of people, a noble and learned lord detailed to us on a former evening. Why such an enormous conspiracy in the several parties concerned, against the established laws and government of their country, has, if fully known, been suffered to pass unpunished, I am at a loss to conceive. I can only account for it on a supposition that some insurmountable difficulties may have occurred in the obtaining of witnesses who would venture to come forward and state such facts upon oath in the face of their spiritual directors, or that a distrust of the disposition in local juries to convict under such circumstances has prevented the institution of such prosecutions as would810otherwise be proper for the correction of such crimes. Certainly these or some other adequate reasons must have operated to produce a temporary impunity, in cases where the safety of the state and the protection of its subjects from the enormous excesses of illegal authority seem to have so much required the application of immediate and exemplary punishment. I am persuaded it could not proceed from a want either of zeal or courage in those whose immediate duty it is to call forth and apply the energies of the law on such important occasions; for I am well assured and know that the public spirit and manliness which hereto fore distinguished the profession of the law in that country, has by no means expired in the person of lord Clare. These are a few and but a few of the practical civil inconveniences which might be instanced as derived to the state and its subjects from the authority of the see of Rome, spiritual and ecclesiastical, as it is exercised over the sons of its church; producing as it does a distracted allegiance in the same person, acknowledging and living under the temporal power of one sovereign, and bound in faith and morals by the authority of another, claiming to be his spirtual guide and governor, his ecclesiastical sovereign, and in effect, in all matters of supreme conscientious concernment, God's vicegerent and representative on earth. it is denied that the effect of this authority was at all mischievously felt during the late troubles in Ireland; and, on the contrary, it is asserted that the rebellion in 1798 was the mere effect of revolutionary principles, fostered, matured, and brought into action by republican leaders, and brought into action by republican leaders, who were not members of the church of Rome.&#x2014;I admit that the leaders of that rebellion, the Emmetts and O'Connors, were men of elevated views and conceptions, minds too highly raised above the groveling regards and credulity of the vulgar, to be subject to the weakness of this, or indeed of any other description of religious faith whatever.&#x2014;I will grant, if it shall be so required, that they were superior to all infirmities of this kind, that they were graduates of the highest class in the schools of republican philosophy, by which i mean \"pure, genuine, unadulterated atheism;\" but the ranks of that army which their treasons brought into the field were not so filled up. The Roman catholic population furnished, as it must, the means, and the priests in many instances, in their own persons, both the inducement and the example of rebellion, by standing811forward as officers amongst them in the day of battle, and imposing for some time upon their superstitions and enthusiastic followers the most extravagant fables of their own miraculous exemption from the perils of fire and sword. I admit that their atheist leaders wished at first to give the mischief a republican direction; but the religious frenzy of the multitude and of their immediate directors soon give it another, as some of the sanguinary and ferocious tragedies which were acted at that period too truly and too fatally testifies. Any person who will take the trouble of referring to the history of that calamitous period, and will afterwards recur to the history of the rebellions of Tyrone and O'Neil, will find the genuine counterparts of each other, and too disgusting a resemblance prevailing between them both, as well in cause as effect. Both followed a period of extreme liberality to the catholics, took place in a season of unsuspecting calm and security, and involved the country in more than the miseries and massacre which are usually attendant upon civil war. We were taught to expect that far other consequences would have followed upon the liberal grants I have already alluded to. We were to have reposed with confidence upon the eternal gratitude of the whole Roman catholic population of Ireland. Nothing, however, of this kind that I recollect, was exhibited in fact, beyond what appeared in a few public addresses of the day; a small return of mouth honour; but neither the king or parliament which conferred, nor the immediate patrons of their cause, who induced parliament to consent to confer these benefits upon them, were very long or gratefully remembered. Two of their first and most active patrons in 1778, had afterwards the unmerited misfortune to fall in the field by the hands of catholic rebels.&#x2014;Before we proceed to grant more, if more we could grant without a direct surrender of all securities of our protestant church and government, it would well become us to consider how our past liberality and confidence have been requited. But we cannot grant more, particularly the boon which is asked of the admission of catholic members into parliament, without putting in peril the whole protestant church and its rights as by law established.&#x2014;The act of settlement has provided for the protestant succession to the crown of England; it has made the being a protestant the indispensable condition upon which the crown is to be worn by any prince812claiming under the limitation in favour of the heirs of the body of princess Sophia, \"being protestants.\"&#x2014;It has not only required the king to be a protestant generally, but to be of that class of protestants which joins in communion with the church of England; and it has excluded papists by industrious description: for it provides and enacts (section 2) that all and every person and persons who shall or may take or inherit the said crown by virtue of the limitation of the present act, and it or shall be reconciled to, or shall hold communion with, the see or church or Rome, or shall profess the popish religion, shall marry a papist, shall be subject to such incapacities, as in such case or cases are by the recited act (i.e. of[...]W. and M.) enacted and established. &#x2014;So peremptory is the tenor of these provisions in exclusion of popish prince from the throne of these kingdoms, that if (a case which is scarce within the extreme limits of actual possibility) his majesty himself should become reconciled to the see of Rome, or profess the popish religion, the crown would in that case, by the instantaneous effect and operation of law, fall from his august and revered brows, and he would stand amongst us a mere unprivileged individual, as wholly divested of the rights, functions, name and character of sovereignty, as the meanest peasant of the land: and can it then be supposed that when such industrious pains have been taken by our ancestors to secure to the kingdom a protestant prince, that it should be left at large whether his parliament should be protestant or papist? But this was already provided for by the test acts in the reign of Charles II. which shut the doors of parliament in both houses on persons who do not take the oaths of allegiance and supremacy, and subscribe the declaration against popery.&#x2014;There restrictions on the parliamentary function and character it is now proposed to repeal; and thus the king may be surrounded, not only by ministers of opposite and conflicting religious, but may find in the same persons a divided and distracted allegiance between his rights as their temporal sovereign, land the rights spiritual and ecclesiastical of the Roman pontiff.&#x2014;It is obvious to the most careless observer, that the measures of government would be enormously clogged and impeded by the close junction and mutual adherence of the catholic members, amounting in the aggregate to a number in England and Ireland sufficiently large to inforce from a minister a degree of con-813descension and deference to their demands in favour of the Roman catholic religion, by which the protestant religion might be undermined and endangered.&#x2014;But if the Roman catholic members are to have seats in parliament, there must be also vested in them a capacity of becoming, as well as others, the king's minsters. I f the king's ministers are to be taken out of the body of catholics, of what avail will it be that we have secured to us, by the act of settlement and the coronation oath, the solitary individual protestanism of his majesty? So that at the last the whole substance of the provision made with so much anxiety and solemnity by our protestant ancestors will be come entirely futile and elusory; for the test acts which preceded the act of settlement, and were the foundation on which alone it could practically rest, must of course be done away before the catholic members can take their seats in either house; the removal of which tests will certainly on principle, and by probable if not necessary influence in point of fact, effectuate a total subversion of the protestant church, as established by law within these realms. I think, my lords, it will scarce be denied by any of those upon the credit of whose assertions your lordships would be disposed to place reliance, that the so strenuously contend for conferring a representative capacity on Roman catholics, is, through the means of such representatives, to procure for the body at large some further advantages in the way of a recognised church establishment, under the immediate authority of parliament. Upon this head, waving for the present all objections whatever to the religious faith and doctrines of that church, and supposing, what I by no means admit, that the points of faith and doctrine in which our church differ from theirs, are of less essential practical importance moral conduct than they appear to me to be; allowing them to entertain, and as publicly as they please, to profess a belief in transubstantiation and in purgatory, to practice the invocation of saints, and to believe and inculcate the belief of(what protestants consider) a legendary chronicle of unauthentic miracles; giving them all facilities of public and private worship and profession of faith on these worship and profession of faith on these and every other subject, if there be any yet wanting and required on their behalf; still an establishment for their church, concurrent with that of the united church of England and Ireland, exceeds814even the competence of parliament itself constituted as it is, to bestow. By the 5th article of the union, it is declared, that \"the continuance and preservation of the said united church as the established church of England and Ireland, shall be deemed and taken to be an essential and fundamental part of the union.\" By fundamental is meant, with reference to the subject matter, such an integral part of the compact of union formed between the two kingdoms, as is absolutely necessary to the support and sustaining of the whole fabric and superstructure of the union raised and built thereupon: and such as being removed, would produce the ruin and overthrow of the political union founded upon this article as its immediate basis. The words \"the established church\" import that there shall be only one church of that description, and which shall alone have the privileges character, and denomination of an established church annexed to it. These terms necessarily exclude any other co-ordinate and concurrent establishment; every other church which has any thing beyond what we commonly understand by the word toleration allowed to it, may be considered as so far established within the meaning of this article; and the union of course, in virtue of such allowed establishment, not only to a degree impugned and violated, but by the express letter of the precise and peremptory provision referred to, absolutely deprived of its very essence and foundation; words, substantially destroyed and subverted. I will hope, therefore that on further consideration the utter impracticability of such project, consistently with the good faith of the two kingdoms solemnly pledged to all who are at the period and by the compact of the union, will be so apparent to all who are at present striving for its adoption, as to dissuade them from the furter prosecution of a measure which, as it must commence in a violation public faith and political rights, must also terminate and dishonour&#x2014;I am one of those, my lords, who labour under an unfortunate persuasion that even if this could legally be, and, in fact, were granted to them; that if the Roman catholic religion were already established in Ireland in some degree of communion and participation of privileges with the united church, that even this grant and indulgence, large as it might now appear to us, would be followed by fresh demands and increased importunity. What assurance is there that they would815rest contented with this boon? or would not the broad banners of papal supremacy be immediately unfurled, and the exclusive domination of the Romish church in Ireland be authoritatively claimed on the ground of this very concession, and of that majority in the population of that country, which alone confers the right (as they contend) of establishing the protestant religion as the religion of the state in this country? Compared with the value of this ultimate prize, the objects hitherto obtained in the struggle would be vile and worthless in their estimation.Jam tenet Italiam, tamen ultra pergere tendit Actum inquit nihil est, nisi p&#x0153;no milite portas Frangimus et media vexillum pone suburr&#x00E2;.Before it is yet too late, I for one am disposed to rally round the standards, and to preserve the altars, of my country. The palladium of our protestant, and, indeed, of our political security, consists principally in the oath of supremacy, and the tests connected therewith and (as more particularly concerns Ireland) in the provisions contained in the 5th article of our recent union with that country, against every attempt to weaken these safeguards of the constitution. I, as long as I live, and am furnished with faculties either of body or mind enabling me to struggle with effect, will manfully struggle, and, as far as in me lies, will avert the mischief which must result from the admission of persons (owning and yielding, as they do, an imperfect and defalcated allegiance to the state,) into the entire and perfect rights of completely affianced subjects.&#x2014;Not being able, my lords, to feel any material degree of evil in the present state of political restraint, as it is necessarily for their good as well as ours, and in the prevention of common calamities affecting us all, applied; and seeing a sure prospect of enormous and incalculable mischiefs before me, which must immediately result from a change:&#x2014;as a subject interested in the safety of the crown and kingdom; as a protestant interested in maintaining the possession of that pure and reformed religion, which having been in times past preserved and sanctified to us by the blood of our ancestors, has been by God's providence long and firmly established in these realms, and which is inseparably knit together in one system, with all our civil rights and liberties, with our best means of happiness here and our best hopes of happiness hereafter; I feel it my duty, my lords,now and for ever, as long as the catholic religion shall maintain816its ecclesiastical and spiritual union with and dependence upon the see of Rome, to resist to the utmost of my power this and every other proposition which is calculated to produce the undoing and overthrow of all that our fathers have regarded, and ourselves have felt and know to be most venerable and useful in our establishments both in church and state.", "author_id": "/people/mr-edward-law-1", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},

I shall deprecate all animosity on the one side or on the other. As the causes have ceased, I think all animosity arising out of those causes should also cease; and instead, therefore, of calumniating either party, I rise to defend both. I do not wish to revive in detail the memory of those rebellions to which the learned member has alluded.&#x2014;The past troubles of Ireland, the rebellion or 1641, and the wars which followed, (said the hon. gent.) I do not wholly forget; but I only remember them to deprecate the example, and renounce the animosity. The penal code which went before, and followed those times, I remember also, but only enough to know that the cause and reasons for that code have totally expired; and as on one side the protestant should relinquish his animosity on account of the rebellion, so the catholics should relinquish their animosity on account of the laws. The question is not stated by member: it is not whether you will keep in a state of disqualification a few Irish catholics, but whether you will keep in a state of langour and neutrality a fifth of your empire. Before you impose such a sentence on yourself, you will require better arguments than those which the member has advanced. He has substantially told you that the Irish catholic church, which is more independent than the catholic church here, is the worst in Europe; that the Irish catholics, our own kindred, conforming to our own terms, are the worst of papists; that the918distinction, a distinction made by the law, propounded by ourselves, and essential to the state, between temporal and spiritual power, is a vain discrimination, that the Irish people, to be good catholics, must be bad subjects; and finally he has emphatically said, \"that an Irish catholic never is, never was, or will be, a faithful subject to a British protestant king&#x2014;they hate all protestants and all Englishmen.\" Thus has he pronounced against his country three curses: eternal war with one another, eternal war with England, and eternal peace with France; so strongly does he inculcate this, that if a catholic printer were in the time of invasion to publish his speech, that printer might be indicted for treason as the publisher of a composition administering to the catholics a stimulative to rise, and advancing the authority of their religion for rebellion. His speech consists of four parts, 1st, invective uttered against the religion of the catholics; 2dly, invective uttered against the present generation; 3dly, invective against the past, and 4thly, invective against the future: here the limits of creation interposed, and stopped the member. It is to defend those different generations and their religion, I rise; to rescue the catholics from his attack, and the protestants from his defence&#x2014;The civil interference of the pope, his assumed power of deposition, together with the supposed doctrine that no faith was to be kept with heretics, were the great objections to the claims of the catholics; to convict them the learned doctor has gone forth with a sinister zeal to collect his rueful materials; and behold! he returns laden with much comment, much doubtful text, much of executive decrees, and of such things as are become obsolete, because useless, and are little attended to, because very dull and very uninteresting, and wherein the learned gent. may for that reason take many little liberties in the way of misquotation, or the way of suppression. All these, the fruits of his unprofitable industry, he lays before you: very kindly and liberally he does it; but of this huge and tremendous collection you must reject a principal part, as having nothing to say to the question, namely, al that matter which belongs to the court of Rome, as distinct from the church; 2dly, of the remnant after that objection you must remove every thing that belongs to the church of Rome which is not doctrine, regarding which is not confined to doctrine, regarding faith and moral, exclusive of, and919unmixed with, any temporal matter whatever. After this correction you will have reduced this gentleman of the 15th century to two miserable canons, the only rewards of his labour, and result of his toil, both centuries before the reformation, and therefore not bearing on the protestants or the reformers. The first is a canon excommunicating persons who do not abide by a profession of faith contained in a preceding canon, which notably concludes with the following observation, that virgins and married women may make themselves agreeable to God. Now I cannot think such a canon can excite any grave impression or alarm in this house; passed 600 years ago, 300 years before the birth of the reformation, made by lay princes as well as ecclesiastics, and never acknowledged or noticed in these islands even in times of their popery. The other canon, that of Constance, goes to deny the force of a free passport or safe conduct to heretics, given by temporal princes in bar of the proceedings of the church. Without going farther into that canon, it is sufficient to say that it is positively affirmed by the catholics, that this does not go farther than to assert the power of the church to enquire into heresy, notwithstanding any impediments from lay princes; and, farther, there is an authority for that interpretation, and in contradiction to the member's interpretation, not merely above his authority, by any that it is in his studies to produce; I mean that of Grotius, who mentions that the imputation cast on the catholics on account of that canon is unfounded. Here I stop, and submit that the member is in the state of a plaintiff, who cannot make out his case, notwithstanding his two canons: that he has failed most egregiously, and has no right to throw the other party on their defence: however, the catholics have gone, as far as relates to him, gratuitously into their case, and have not availed themselves of the imbecility of their opponents; and they have been enabled to produce on the subject of the above charges, the opinion of six universities, to whom those charges, in the shape of queries, have been submitted: Paris, Louvaine, Salamanca, Douay, Valladolid, Alcala. The universities have all answered, and have in their answers not only disclaimed them with abhorrence. The catholics have not stopped here: they have drawn up a declaration of nine articles, together with other doctrines or920views objected to them. They have gone further, they have desired the protestants to name their own terms of abjuration; the protestants have done so, and here is the instrument of their compact; it is an oath framed by a protestant parliament, principally manufactured by the hon. member himself, in which the Irish catholics not only abjure the imputed doctrine, but are sworn to the state, and to the present establishment of the protestant church in Ireland, and to the present state of protestant property. This oath has been universally taken, and by this oath both parties are concluded, the catholics from resorting to the abjured doctrines, and the protestants from resorting to the abjured charge. Therefore, when the member imputes, as he has done, to the catholic the principles hereby abjured, it is not the catholic who breaks faith with him, but it is he who breaks faith with the catholic. He acts in violation of the instrument he himself formed, and is put down by his own authority. But the Catholics have not only thus obtained a special acquittal from the charges made against them in this debate, they have obtained a general acquittal also&#x2014;The most powerful of their opponents, the late earl of Clare, writes as follows: \"they who adhere to the church of Rome are good catholics, they who adhere to the court of Rome are traitors;\" and he them quotes Lord Somers as his authority, in which he entirely acquiesces, and acknowledges their innocence in their adherence to the church Rome as distinct from the court&#x2014;A test, such as I have already mentioned, is formed, abjuring the doctrine of the court of Rome, and reducing their religion to the church of Rome. This test together with a number of other articles, is reduced to an oath, and this-oath is introduced into an act of parliament, and this oath is taken universally. Here again are the opponents to the catholics concluded by their own concessions. By tendering an oath to catholics, they allow oath to be test of sincerity; by framing that oath under the circumstances, they make it a test of pure catholicism; and by their own arguments, they pronounce pure catholicism to be innoxious. But the hon. member has gone a little further than pronouncing the innocence of the catholics, he has pronounced the mischievous consequences of the laws that proscribe them; he has said in so many words that an Irish catholic never is, and never will be faithful to a British protestant921king, he does not say every catholic, for then he would include the English catholics and those of Canada; nor does he say every Irishman must hate the king, for then he would include every protestant in Ireland. The cause of the hatred is not then in the religion nor in the soil&#x2014;it mut be then in the laws, in something which the protestant does not experience in Ireland, nor the catholics in any country but in Ireland; that is to say, in the penal code. That code then, according to him, has made the catholics enemies to the king: thus has he acquitted the catholics, and convicted the laws. This is not extraordinary, it is the natural progress of a blind and a great polemic. Such characters begin with a fatal candour, and then precipitate to a fatal extravagance, and are at once undermined by their candour, and exposed by their extravagance: so with the member, he hurries on he knows not where, utters he cares not what, and is equally negligent of the grounds of his assertions, and their necessary inferences. Thus, when he thinks he is establishing his errors, unconsciously and unintentionally he promulgates truth; or rather, in the very tempest of his speech, Providence seems to govern his lips, so that they shall prove false to his purposes, and bear witness to his refutations. Interpret the gentleman, literally, what blasphemies has he uttered? He said that the catholic religion, abstracted as it is at present in Ireland from popery, and reduced as it is to mere catholicism, inconsistent with the duties of morality and allegiance, as to be a very great evil. Now, that religion is the christianity of two thirds of all Christendom; it follows then, according to the learned doctor, that the christian religion is in general a curse. He has added, that his own countrymen are not only depraved by religion, but rendered perverse by nativity; that is to say, according to him, blasted by their Creator, and damned by their Redeemer. In order, therefore, restore the member to the character of a christian, we must renounce him as art advocate, and acknowledge that he has acquitted the catholics which meant to condemn, and convicted the laws which he meant to defend. But though the truth may be eviscerated from the whole of the member's statement, it is not to be discerned in the particular parts; and therefore it is not sufficient to refute his arguments, 'tis necessary to controvert his facts. The catholics of Ireland, he says, hate the protestants, hate the English, and hate the922king. I must protest against the truth of this position; the laws, virulent as they were, and mitigated as for the last seventeen years they have been, the people better than the laws, never could have produced that mischief; against such a position I appeal to the conscious persuasion of every Irishman. We will put it to an issue: the present chief governor of Ireland is both an Englishman and the representative of English government; I will ask the hon. gentleman whether the Irish hate him? If I could believe this position, what could I think of the protestant ascendancy, and what must I think of the British connection and government, who have been for six hundred years in possession of the country with no other effect, according to this logic, than to make its inhabitants abhor you and your generation? But this position contains something more than a departure from fact; it says, \"strike France; strike, Spain; the great body of the Irish are with you:\" it does much more, it attempts to give them a provocation; it teaches you to hate them, and them to think so; and thus falsehood takes its chance of generating into fatal and treasonable truth. The hon. gentleman having misrepresented the present generation, mistates the conduct of their ancestors, and sets forth the past rebellions as proceeding entirely from religion. I will follow him to those rebellions, and shew, beyond his power of contradiction, that religion was not, and that proscription was, the leading cause of those rebellions. The rebellion of 1641, or let me be controverted by any historian of authority, did not proceed from religion; it did proceed from the extermination of the inhabitants of eight countries in Ulster, and from the foreign and bigoted education of the catholic clergy, and not from religion. The rebellion of the pale (for it was totally distinct in period or cause from the other) did not proceed from religion; loss of the graces; they resembled your petition of right, except that they embraced articles for the security of property; disarmament of the catholics, expulsion of them in that disarmed state from Dublin; many other causes,&#x2014;order for the execution of certain priests. You will not forget there was an order to banish their priests in James the First's time, and to shut up their chapels in Charles the First's. These were the causes. There was another cause: you were in rebellion, Scotland was in rebellion! These was another cause, the Irish government was in rebellion; they had taken their part with the republicans, and wished to923draw into treason the Irish freeholders, that with the forfeiture of another's rebellion they might supply their own. I go back with concern to those times: I see much blood, no glory; but I have the consolation to find that the causes are not lodged in the religion or the soil, and that all of them but the proscriptive cause have vanished. I follow the member to another rebellion, the which should properly be called a civil war, not a rebellion; it proceeded from a combination of causes which exist no longer, and one of those causes was the abdicating king at the head of the catholics, and another cause was the violent proscription carried on against the catholics by the opposite and then prevailing party. These causes are now no more; or will the member say there is now an abdicating prince, or now a popish plot, or now a pretender? There are causes, most certainly, sufficient to alarm you, but very different, and such as can only be combated by a conviction that, as destinies are now disposed of, it is not the power of the catholics which can destroy, or the exclusion of the catholics which can save you. The conclusion I draw from the history above alluded to, is very different from that drawn by the member, and far more healing; conclusions to shew the evils arising from foreign connections on one side, and from domestic proscription on the other. If all the blood shed on these occasions; if the many fights in the first, and the signal battles in the second period, and the consequences of those battles to the defeated and the triumphant, to the slave that fled, and the slave that followed, shall teach our country the wisdom of conciliation, I congratulate her on those deluges of blood: if not, I submit, and lament her fate, and deplore her understanding, which would render not only the blessings of Providence, but its visitations fruitless, and transmit what was the curse of our fathers as the inheritance of our children.&#x2014;The learned gentleman proceeds to mistate a period of 100 years, namely, the century that followed the revolution, and this he makes a period of open or concealed rebellions. The sources of his darkness and misinformation are to be found in history and revelation. Of his charges against that period he brings no proof; none of those on the same side with him can bring any. They heard from such a one, who heard from such a one: I neither believe them nor such a one, and I desire so many generations may not be convicted on evidence that-would not be- admitted against the vilest caitiff; and924that against evidence by which that vilest caitiff would be acquitted, again the authority of four acts of parliament; the act of 1778, which declares their loyalty for a long series of years, that of 1782, that of 1792, and that of 1793; and farther against the declared sense of government, who, in the year 1762, proposed to raise four catholic regiments, because the catholics had proved their allegiance; and against the authority of the then Irish primate, who supported that measure, and in his speech on that subject, assigns as his reason, that, after his perusal of Mr. Murray's papers, nothing appeared against the Irish catholics of any connection whatsoever with the rebellion of that period. The member proceeds to the rebellion of 1798, and this he charges to the catholics; and against his charge I appeal to the committee of the Irish house of commons in 1797, in which it sets forth the rebel muster, containing 99,000 northerns enrolled in rebellion, and all the northern counties organised. At the time in which the committee of the house of commons states the rebellion of the north; the dispatches of government acknowledged the allegiance of the south. To those dispatches I appeal, written at the time of Hoche's projected invasion, and applauding the attachment and loyalty of the southern counties, and their exertions to assist the army on its march to Cork to oppose the landing of the French. If you ask how the rebellion spread, and involved the catholics, I will answer and tell you, that as long as the proscriptive system continues, there will be in our country a staminal weakness, rendering the distempers to which society is obnoxious, not only dangerous, but deadly. Every epidemic disease will bring the chronic distemper into action. It is the grapestone in the hand of death, which strikes with the force of a thunderbolt. If you have any apprehension on this account, the error is to be found in yourselves; in human policy, not in religion; in the fallibility of man, not of God. If you wish to strip rebellion of its hopes, France of her expectations, reform that policy; you will gain a victory over the enemy when you gain a conquest over yourselves. But I will for a moment accede to the member's statement against facts and history: what is his inference? during one hundred years of the proscriptive system, this state has been in imminent danger: therefore, adds he, continue the system; here is the regimen under which you have declined&#x2014;persevere. But the member proceeds to ob-925serve, that you cannot hope to reconcile whom you cannot hope to satisfy; and he instances the repeal of the penal code. I deny the instances: the repeal in 1778 and 1782 did reconcile and did satisfy; and according you will find that the Irish catholics in 1779, 1780, 1781, and 1782, were active and unanimous to repel the invasion threatened at that time, when the French rode in the Channel, and Ireland was left to the care 6000 regulars, and was only defended from invasion by the spirit and loyalty of the catholics, in harmony and in arms with their protestant brethren. The repeal of a principal part of the penal code, in 1793, did not reconcile, and did not satisfy: it was because the Irish government of that time was an enemy to the repeal and to the catholics, and prevented the good effects of that measure. That government, in the summer of 1792, had sent instructions (I know the fact to be so) to the grand juries, to enter into resolutions against the claims of the catholics. Their leading minister opposed himself at one of the county meetings, and took a memorable post of hostility and publicity. When the petition of the catholics was recommended in the king's speech 1793, the Irish minister answered the king, and with unmeasured severity attacked the petitioners. When the bill introduced in consequence of his majesty's recommendation was in progress, the same minister, with as unmeasured severity, attacked the bill, and repeated his severity against the catholics. When the some bill a of reconciliation, in consequence of the recommendation and reference of the petition, was on its passage, the Irish government attempted to hang the leading men among the petitioners, and accordingly Mr. Bird and, Mr. Hamil were by these orders indicted for a capital offence, I think it was defenderism; and so little ground was there for the charge that those men were triumphantly acquitted, and the witnesses of the crown so flagrantly perjured, that the judge, I have heard, recommended a prosecution. These were the causes why the repeal of 1793 did not satisfy; and in addition to these, because the government took care that the catholics should receive no benefit; therefore opposing these with their known partisans and dependents in the corporation of Dublin, when they sought for the freedom of the city, seldom giving any office (there are very few instances in which they got any) in consequence of the act of parliament, and always attacking their cha-926racters from a court press; so that the aversion of the Irish government stood in the place of disqualification by law, and the hostility of the Irish minister succeeded to the hostility of statute. The catholics, some of them I know, thought so, and there are gentlemen now in parliament to whom they communicated their sentiments, that they would prefer their situation before the repeal of 1793, to the situation which followed; inasmuch as they experienced in the then Irish government a more deadly and more active enemy than before they had experienced in the law. I refer to the speeches delivered and published at the time by the ministers and servants of the Irish government, and persisted in and delivered since. There you will see an attack on all the proceedings of the Irish from the time of their address for free trade, such as were glorious as well as those that were intemperate; without discrimination or moderation: there you will see the Irish ministry engaged in a wretched squabble with the catholic committee, and that catholic committee replying on that ministry, and degrading it more than it had degraded itself; and you will further perceive the members of that ministry urging their charges against the members of that committee, to disqualify other catholic who were not of the committee, but opposed it: so that by their measures against the one part of the catholics, and their invective against the other, they take care to alienate, as far as in them lay, the whole body. The fact is, the project of conciliation in 1793, recommendation in the speech from the throne, was defeated by the Irish cabinet, which was at that time on that subject in opposition, and being incensed at the British cabinet for the countenance afforded to the catholics, punished the latter, and sowed those seeds which afterwards, in conjunction with other causes, produced the rebellion&#x2014;I leave the member, and proceed to discuss the differences now remaining that discriminate his majesty's subjects of the protestant and catholic persuasion. Before we consider how far we differ, it is necessary to examine how far we agree. We acknowledge the same God, the same Redeemer, the same consequences of redemption, same Bible, and the same Testament. Agreeing in this, we cannot, as far as respects religion, quarrel about the remainder, because their merits as christians must in our opinion outweigh their demerits as catholics, and reduce our religious distinctions to a difference about the eucharist, the mass, and927the Virgin Mary, matters which may form a difference of opinion, but not a division of interests.&#x2014;The infidel under these circumstances would consider us as the same religionists, just as the French would consider you, and cut you down, as the same community. See whether we are not agreed a little farther, and united by statute, as well as religion. The preambles of three acts declare the catholics to be loyal subjects; the act of 1778 declares that they have been so for a series of years; the same act declares that they should be admitted into the blessing of the constitution; the act of 1793 goes farther, and admits them into a participation of those blessings. Thus is the principle of identification established by the law of the land, and thus are the catholics by that law proclaimed to be innocent, and the calumniators of the catholics guilty. Let us consider their situation under these laws, professedly and in principle admitted to every thing except seats in parliament, and certain offices of state; they are, in fact, excluded from every thing under the circumstances of paying for every thing; the few places they enjoy make no exception; they pay their proportion to the navy, and contribute one-third to its numbers, and have not a commission: they contribute to the expenses of the army, and to one-third of its numbers, and have not a commission: and shall I now be asked how are the catholics affected by this, or be told that the catholic body would not be served by the removal of this? How would the protestant body be affected, if only removed from the state, the parliament, the navy, and the army? In addition to this I am to add the many minor injuries done to the catholics in ways that must be felt, and cannot be calculated; the inestimable injury done to the catholic mind by precluding it from the objects of ambition, and to the catholic spirit by exposing it to the taunts and insults, (you cannot be at a loss for an instance), such as are uttered by the vilest of the protestants against the first of the catholics. I am to add the mischief done to the morals of the country by setting up a false standard of merit, by which men without religion, moral or public integrity, shall obtain, by an abhorrence of their fellow subjects, credit and consequence, and acquire an impunity for selling the whole community, because they detest a part of it. You see it is impossible for any one part of the society to afflict the other without paying the penalty, and feel-928ing the consequences of its own policy in the re-action of its own bad passions on itself. I am to add the mischief done to the peace of the country, when the spirit of religious discord descends to the lower order of people, and the holiday becomes a riot: and when the petty magistrate turns chapman and dealer in politics, turns theologian and robber, makes for himself a situation in the country formed out of the monstrous lies he tells of his catholic neighbours, fabricates false panics of insurrection and invasion, then walks forth the man of blood, his creditors tremble, the French do not; and atrocities, which he dare not commit in his own name, perpetrates for the honour of his king, and in the name of his Maker. I have heard of the incivilisation of Ireland: too much has been said on that subject. I deny the fact; a country exporting above five millions, even at your official value, near about half a million of corn, three millions of linen, paying eight millions to the state, cannot be barbarous; a nation connected with you for six hundred years, what do you say? cannot be barbarous. If France should say so, you would contradict her, because it is not on Ireland, but on you, the reflection must fall. But if anything, however, delays the perfect and extensive civilization of Ireland, it is principally her religious animosity. Examine all the causes of human misery, the tragic machinery of the globe, and the instruments of civil rage and domestic murder, and you find no demon is like it, because it privileges all the rest, and amalgamates with infidelity as well as murder, and conscience, which restrains other vices, becomes a prompter here. To restrain this waste, and this conquest exercised over your understanding, your morals, and your fortune, my hon. friend makes his motion. The present lord lieutenant of Ireland has done much to reconcile, but his mild integrity and good sense must be aided by parliament. Come, let us hear the objectors. The catholics, they say, should not have power. Why, they have it already: they got it when you gave them landed property, and they got it when yen gave them the elective franchise: \"Be it enacted, that the catholics shall be capable of holding all offices, civil and military, except;\"(and then the act excludes a certain numeration.) This is the act of 1793, and is not this political power allowed by act of parliament? so that the objection goes not so much against the petition, as against the law, and the929law is the answer to it. The reasons they give for objecting to the law are, first, that the catholics do not acknowledge the king to be the head of their church. To require a person of the catholic faith to acknowledge a person of another religion, who makes no very encouraging declarations towards them, to be the head of the catholic church, is going very far; but to make the withholding such acknowledgment the test of disaffection is much farther; farther than reason, and farther than the law, which does not require such test, but is satisfied with a negative oath: and therefore, the presbyterian, who makes no such acknowledgement, may sit in parliament. So that here the objector is answered again by the law, and the reason he gives in opposition to the law shows, that the legislature is wiser than he is; the reason alleged is, that he who allows his majesty to be the head of his church, has more allegiance, because he acknowledges the king in more capacities. According to this, the Turk has more allegiance than either, for he acknowledges the grand seignior in all capacities; and the Englishman has allegiance than any other subject in Europe, because, whereas other European subjects acknowledge their king in a legislative, as well as an executive capacity, the English acknowledge their king in the latter capacity only. But such men know not how to estimate allegiance, which is not measured by the powers which you allow, but by the privileges which you keep; thus your allegiance is of an higher order, because it is rendered for the proud circumstances belonging to an Englishman; to the peer who has his rank, the commoner who has his rank, the commoner who has his privileges, and the peasant who has magna charta; the catholic too, he has an interest in his allegiance; increase that interest, that is, increase this privilege, you increase the force of the obligation, and with it your own security. But here, again, the objector interposes, and alleges that the catholic does not only acknowledge the king to be the head of their church, but acknowledges a foreign power. Whom? I cannot find him; there was, indeed, a power which you set up in the last war, and guarded with your troops. Is that the memory at which gentlemen tremble? a sort of president or chair, in whose name the business of the catholic church is conducted; for whom no catholic would fight, and against whom the Irish catholic would fight, if he came into their country would fight, if he came into their country at the head of an invading army&#x2014;they have said930so. You will recollect how little you yourselves feared that name, when you encompassed and preserved it at the very time of the Irish rebellion; and now do gentlemen set it up, and bring it back again into the world as a principle to influence the action of the Irish? But then I have received an answer to this; and that Buonapart&#x00E9; has gotten possession of the power and person of the pope. What power? He had no power before his captivity, and therefore he became a captive; he has not found his power in his captivity. Or will you say that he could now disband an Austrian army, or an Irish army; or that, if he were to issue out his excommunications, your seamen or soldiers would desert? Such the power of the pope&#x2014;such your fear of it, and such is the force of their argument: what is the policy of it? Buonapart&#x00E9; has gotten the pope; give him the catholics. But here the objector interposes again, and tells us it is in vain to look for harmony with the catholics, inasmuch as they deliver the protestants to damnation. Gravely they say this, soberly they say this in a morning; and, according to this, you must not only repeal your laws of toleration, but you must disband part of your army and your navy, and disqualify your electors. The catholic who hears this, produces a protestant creed which does the same thing, and damns his sect likewise. The infidel who listens agrees with both, and triumphs; and suggests that it were better not to cast off your people, but to shake off your religion. So Volney makes all sects contend and all conquer, and religion the common victim. The truth is, exclusive salvation was the common frenzy of all sects, and is the religion of none; and is now not only rejected by all, but laughed at: so burning one another, as well as damning one another. You can produce instances&#x2014;they can produce instances: it was the habit of the early christians to anathematise all sects but their own. No religion can stand, if me, without regard to their God, and with regard only to controversy, shall rake out of the rubbish of antiquity, the obsolete and quaint follies of the sectarians, and affront the majesty of the Almighty with the impudent catalogue of their devices; and it is a strong argument against the proscriptive system, that it helps to continue this shocking contest&#x2014;theologian against theologian&#x2014;polemic against polemic, until the two made men defame their common parent, and expose their common religion. With argu-931ments such as those, it is urged, the the the laws were in error which gave the catholic political power; and it is farther added, that he will use that political power to destroy the church. I do not think they have now said he will destroy the present state of property; bigotry has retired from that part, and has found out at last that the catholics cannot repeal the act of settlement in Ireland, by which the property of the country was ascertained, until they become the parliament; nor become the parliament till they get the landed property of the country; and that when they get that property, that they will not pass an act to set aside their titles. Further, it is now understood, that the protestant title is by time; that there are few old catholic proprietors&#x2014;a multitude of new ones; that the catholic tenantry hold under protestant titles, and therefore that there is, in support of the present state of property in Ireland, not only the strength of the protestant interest, but the physical force of the catholics; therefore the objectors have judiciously retired from that ground, and now object to catholic power as certain to destroy the protestant church&#x2014;how? They must do it by act of legislation, or by act of force: by act of legislation they cannot, and by force they will not. They will not by act of force, because the measures proposed, which do not go to increase that force, do go decisively to remove the animosity. Or will you say, when you give them every temporal motive to allegiance, they will become rebels? that when indeed they had rights of religion, rights of property, rights of election, they were loyal; but when you gratified their ambition likewise, they then became disaffected, and ready to sacrifice all their temporal rights and political gratifications&#x2014;in order to do what? To get a larger income for their clergy; that is, that their bishops should drink more claret, wear finer clothes, and with whose assistance should they do this? With the aid of the French, who starve their clergy. The ordinary principles of action, the human motives that direct other men, according to these reasoners, are not to be found in the catholic. Nature is in him reversed: he is not influenced by the love of family, of property, of privileges, of power, or any human passions, according to his antagonists, no more than his antagonists are influenced by human reason, and therefore it is these reasoners deal mostly in the prophetic strain, with a prophets fury and his blindness&#x2014;with much zeal, and no religion. I would ask then, what authority have they932for, thus introducing the church as an obstacle to the advantages of the state? Is it political, or is it moral, to deprive the catholic of the franchises of the constitution, because they contribute to the church, lest, on obtaining those franchises, they should pass laws with-holding that contribution? as if you had any right to make that supposition, or any right to insist on that perilous monopoly, which should exclude them at once from church and state, that they might pay for both without compensation. The great preachers of our capital have not said so, Mr. Dunn, that meek spirit of the Gospel&#x2014;he has not said so. Mr. Douglas, in his strain of piety, morals, and eloquence&#x2014;he has not said so. Nor the great luminary himself&#x2014;he who has wrung from his own breast, as it were, near 60,000l. by preaching for public charities, and has stopped the mouth of hunger with its own bread&#x2014;he has not said so. I ask not what politicians may instil and may whisper; what have the labouring clergymen preached and practised?&#x2014;But the revolution, it seems, is an eternal bar: they find the principles of slavery in the revolution, as they lane found those of darkness in the revelation. If they mean to measure the privileges of the empire by the model existing at the revolution, they must impose on Ireland eternal proscription, for at that time she was deprived of the rights of trade and constitution, and the catholics of all rights whatsoever; and they must impose on the empire two opposite principles of action, the free system for England, and the proscriptive principle for the rest. They are then to make Ireland fight for British liberty and Irish exclusion. Their argument is therefore not only a wicked wish, but a vain one, Nor is this the practice of other countries; those countries do not require the religion of the public officer to be the religion of the state; their practice has been notoriously otherwise: they who said the contrary labour under a glaring error. Nor will you be able to encounter France and the other nations of Europe, if they should avail themselves of the talents of all their people, and you will oppose them by only a part of yours, and while you deprive yourself of the full strength of those talents, expose yourself to their animosity. It follows then, whether you look principles of liberty or empire, that you cannot make the proscriptive system existing at the revolution the measure of the other parts of your empire; you must then make the principles of the revolution that measure. What are those principles? Civil933and religious liberty. They existed at that time in full force for you, they existed as seminal principles for us, they were extended to the protestant part of Ireland a century after, they remain now to be extended to the catholics. Then will your revolution be completed, not overthrown; then will you extend the principles of your empire on those of your constitution, and have secured an uniformity of action by creating an identity of interest; thus will you have simplified the imperial and constitutional motions to the one and the same principle of action, moving you in your home and in your imperial orbit, informing the body of your laws, and vivifying the mass of your empire.&#x2014;The petition of the county of Oxford states the catholics have been ever enemies to freedom, just as the controversialists have said the catholics must be enemies to the king. The revolution, from whose benefits you are to exclude the catholics, was founded on a model formed and moulded by catholics, the declaration of right being almost entirely declaratory of rights and privileges secured by your catholic ancestors. One of your great merits at the revolution was not to have exceeded that models, but on the contrary you restrained popular victory, and restored establishments, and with them kindled a modest spirit, which has outlasted the French conflagration, a vital heat, which then cheered you, which now should cheer the catholic, and,giving light and life to both, I hope will be eternal&#x2014;The great objects, church, state, and property, I adopt With the controversialist, and beg to rescue them from his wisdom, and to give them for their support the physical force of the catholic body, inasmuch as our danger does not arise from the possible abuse of his constitutional power, but from the possible abuse of his physical thoughts to obtain that constitutional power. In all this debate you will observe we argue as if we had but one enemy, the catholic, and we forget the French: and here what I said to the Irish parliament, on the catholic question, I will repeat to you. I said to them, \"the post you take is unfavourable,&#x2014;in dependency of the British parliament, exclusion of the Irish catholics, a post to be kept against the power of one country, and the freedom of the other.\" I now say to you, the post you would take is unfavourable, a position that would keep France in check and Ireland in thraldom, to be held against the power of one country and the freedom of the other. There are934three systems for Ireland: one such as primate Boulton has disclosed, a system to set the people at variance on account of religion, that the government might be strong and the country weak; a system, such an one as prevailed when I broke her chain, which made the minister too strong for the constitution and the country, too weak for the enemy; a system which one of its advocates has described, when he said the protestants of Ireland were a garrison in an enemy's country, and which another gentleman has described when he considered Inland as a caput mortuum. This system has failed; it ought to have failed; it was a party government and a party god.&#x2014;There is another, extermination, that will not do&#x2014;the extermination of three millions of, men would be no easy task in execution, no every charitable measure in conception. The justices of 1641 had dreamed of it, Cromwell had attempted, Harrington had talked of it. I hold the extermination of the people, and even of their hierarchy, to be such experiment as will not be proposed by any gentleman who is perfectly in his senses. Extermination,, then, will not do; what is left? The partial adoption of the catholics has failed, the eradication of the catholics cannot be attempted, the absolute incorporation remains alone; there is no other; or did you think it necessary to unite with the Irish parliament, and do hesitate to identify with the people? See whether you can conduct your empire on any other principle. The better to illustrate this, and in order to ascertain the principles of your empire, survey its comprehension, computing your West Indies, and your eastern dominions. England has now, with all deference to her moderation, a very great proportion of the globe. On what principle will she govern that proportion? On the principles on which Providence governs that and the remainder. When yon make your dominions commensurate with a great portion of her works, you should make your laws analogous to her dispensations. As there is no such thing as exclusive Providence, so neither, considering the extent of your, empire, should there be such a thing as an exclusive empire, but such an one as accommodates to peculiar habits, religious prejudices; prepossessions, &c.; &c.; You do not, in your dispatches to your generals, send the thirty-nine articles: you know the bigot and conqueror are incompatible; Lewis XIV found it so. You know that no nation is long indulged in the exercise of the two qualities&#x2014;935bigotry to proscribe at home, ambition to disturb abroad. Such. was your opinion when you established popery in Canada; I do not speak of Corsica&#x2014; such your opinion when you recruited for the foot in Ireland. It was in the American war this practice began: then you found that the principle of exclusive empire would not answer, and that her test was not who should say her prayers, but who should fight her battles. On the same principle the Irish militia, which must be in a great proportion catholic, stands; and on the same principle the Irish yeomanry, who must be in a considerable proportion catholic, stands; and on the same principle you have recruited for the navy in Ireland, and have committed your sea thunder to catholic hands. Suppose in Egypt the general had ordered the catholics to go out of the ranks; or if, in one of your sea-fights, the admiral had ordered all the catholics on shore, what had been the consequence? It is an argument against the proscriptive system, that if adopted practically, in navy or army, the navy and army and empire would evaporate. And shall we now proclaim these men, or hold such language as the member, language, which, if he held on the day of battle, he must be shot; language for which, if a catholic, he must be hanged; such as you despised in the case of Corsica and of Canada, in the choice of your allies, in the recruiting your army and your navy, whenever your convenience; whenever your ambition, whenever your interest required. Or let us turn from the magnitude of your empire to the magnitude of its danger, and you will observe, that whereas Europe was heretofore divided in many small nations of various religions making part of their civil policy, and with alliances influenced in some degree and directed by those religious distinctions, where civil and religious freedom were supposed to be drawn up on one side, and on the other popery and arbitrary power, so now the globe has been divided anew. England and France, you have taken a first situation among mankind; you are, of course, excluded from a second: Austria may have a second situation, Prussia may have a second, but England seems to have linked her being to her glory, and when she ceases to be of the first she is nothing. According to this supposition, and it is a supposition which I do not frame, but find in the country, the day may not be very remote when you will have to fight for being, and far what you value more than being,936the ancient renown of your island. You have said it yourselves, and you have added, that Ireland is your vulnerable part: why vulnerable? Vulnerable because you have misgoverned her. It may then happen that on Irish ground, and by an Irish hand, the destinies of this ancient monarchy called Great Britain, may be decided. Accordingly, you have voted your army, but you have forgot to vote your people; you must vote their passions likewise. Their horrors at the French proceedings will do much, but it is miserable to rely on the crimes of your enemies always, on your own wisdom never. Besides, those horrors did not prevent Prussia from leaving your alliance, nor Austria from making peace, nor the united Irishmen from making war. Loyalty will do much, but you require more&#x2014;patience under taxes, such as are increased far beyond what we have been accustomed to, from one million and a half to 8,000,000; nor patience only, but ardour&#x2014;the strong qualities, not such as the scolding dialect of certain gentlemen would excite&#x2014;the fire, a spirit that in the case of an invasion will not sit as a spy on the doubt of the day and calculate, but, though the first battle should be unsuccessful, would come out with a desperate fidelity, and embody with the destinies of England. It is a wretched thing to ask, how would they act in such a case? What, after a connexion of six hundred years, to thank your admiral for your safety, or the wind, or any thing but your own wisdom! and therefore the question is not whether the catholics shall get so many seats, but whether you shall get so many millions; I in such a case you live all people. What is it that constitutes the strength and health of England but this sort of vitality, that her privileges, like her money, circulate every where, and center no where? This it was which equality would have given, but did not give, France; this it was which the plain sense of your ancestors, without equality, did give the English; a something which limited her kings, drove her enemies, and made a handful of men fill the world with their name.&#x2014;Will you, in your union with Ireland, with-hold the regimen which has made you strong, and continue the regimen which has made her feeble? You will further recollect, that you have invited her to your patrimony, and hitherto you have given her taxes and additional debt, I believe it is of 26,000,000. The other part of your patrimony, I should be glad to see that, Talk plainly and honestly to the Irish937&#x2014;'tis true your taxes are increased, and your debts multiplied, but here are our privileges, great burthens and great privileges: this is the patrimony of England, and with this does she assess, recruit, inspire, consolidate. But the protestant ascendancy, it is said, alone can keep the country, namely, the gentry, clergy, and nobility, against the French, and without the people. It may be so. But, in 1641, above ten thousand troops were sent from England to assist that party; in 1789, twenty-three regiments were raised in England to assist them; in 1798, the English militia were sent over to assist them. What can be done by spirit will be done by them; but would the city of London, on such assurance, risk a guinea? The parliament of Ireland did risk every thing, and are now nothing; and in their extinction left this instruction, not to their posterity, for they have none, but to you, who come in the place of their posterity, not to depend on a sect of religion, nor trust the final issue,of your fortunes to any thing less than the:whole of your people.&#x2014;The parliament of Ireland&#x2014;of that assembly I have a parental recollection. I sat by her cradle, I followed her hearse.&#x2014;In fourteen years she acquired for Ireland what you did not acquire for England in a century&#x2014;freedom of trade, independency of the legislature, independency of the judges, restoration of the final judicature, repeal of a perpetual mutiny bill, habeas corpus act, nullum tempos act. A great work! you will exceed it, and I shall rejoice. I call my countrymen to witness if, in that business, I compromised the claims of my country, or temporised with the power of England. But there was one thing which baffled the effort of the patriot, and defeated the wisdom of the senate; it was the folly of the theologian. When the parliament of Ireland rejected the catholic petition, and assented to the calumnies then uttered against the catholic body, on that day she voted the union. If you should adopt a similar conduct, on that day you will vote the separation. Many good and pious reasons you may give, many good and pious reasons she gave, and she lies there with her many good and her pious reasons. That the parliament of Ireland should have entertained prejudices, I am not astonished; but that you&#x2014;that you who have as individuals and as conquerors visited a great part of the globe, and have seen men in all their modifications, and Providence in all her ways&#x2014;that you, now at this time of the day, should throw dykes against the pope938and barriers against the catholic, instead uniting with that catholic to throw up barriers against that French&#x2014;this surprises; and, in addition to this, that you should have set up the pope in Italy to,tremble at him in Ireland; and further, that you should have professed to have placed yourself at the head of a christian not a protestant league, to defend the civil and religious liberty of Europe, and should deprive of civil liberty one fifth of yourselves, on account of,their religion&#x2014;this surprises me; and also, that you should prefer to buy allies by subsidies rather than fellow subjects by privileges; and that you should now stand, drawn out as it were in battalion, 16,000,000 against 36,000,000, and should at the same time paralize a fifth of your own numbers, by excluding them from some of the principal benefits of your constitution, at the very time you say all your numbers are inadequate, unless inspired by those very privileges. As I recommended to you to give the privileges, so I should recommend the catholics to wait cheerfully and dutifully. The temper with which they bear the privation of power and privilege is evidence of their qualification. They will recollect the strength of their case, which sets them above impatience; they will recollect the growth of their case, from the time it was first agitated to the present moment, and in that growth perceive the perishable nature of the objections, and the immortal quality of the principle they contend for; they will further recollect what they have gotten already, rights of religion, rights of property, and, above all, the elective franchise, which is in itself the seminal principle of every thing else. With vessel so laden they will be too wise to leave the harbour, and trust the fallacy of any wind. Nothing can prevent the ultimate success of the catholics but intemperance; for this they will be too wise. The charges uttered against them they will answer by their allegiance. So should I speak to the catholics. To the protestant I would say&#x2014;You have gotten the land and powers of the country, and it now remains to make those acquisitions eternal. Do not you see, according to the present state and temper of England and France, that your country must ultimately be the seat of war; do not you see that your children must stand in the front of the battle, with uncertainty and treachery in the rear of it? If then, by ten or twelve seats in parliament, given to catholics, you could prevent such a day, would not the compromise be every thing? What is your wretch-939ed monopoly, the shadow of your present, the memory of your past power, compared to the safety of your families, the security of your estates, and the solid peace and repose of your island? Besides, you have an account to settle with the empire. Might not the empire accost you thus? \"For one hundred years you have been in possession of the country, and very loyally have you taken to yourselves the power and profit thereof. I am now to receive at your hands the fruits of all this, and the unanimous support of the people; where is it, now when I am beset with enemies, and in my day of trial?\". Let the protestant ascendancy answer that question, for I cannot. Above twenty millions have been wasted on your shocking contest, and a great proportion of troops of the line locked up in your island, that you may enjoy the ascendancy of the country and the empire, not receive the strength of it. Such a system cannot last; your destinies must be changed and exalted. The catholic no longer your inferior, nor you inferior to every one, save only the catholic; both must be free, and both must fight&#x2014;the enemy, and not one another. Thus the sects of religion, renouncing, the one all foreign connection, and the other all domestic proscription, shall form a strong country; and thus the two islands, renouncing all national prejudices, shall form a strong empire, a phalanx in the west, to check, perhaps ultimately to confound, the ambition of the enemy. I know the ground on which I stand, and the truths which I utter; and I appeal to the objections you urge against me, which I constitute my judges, to the spirit of your own religion, and to the genius of your own revolution; and I consent to have the principle which I maintain tried by any test; and equally sound, I contend, it will be found, whether you apply it to constitution where it is freedom, or to empire where it is strength, or to religion where it is light.&#x2014;Turn to the opposite principle, proscription and discord. It has made in Ireland not only war but even peace calamitous: witness the one that followed the victories of King William, to the catholics a sad servitude, to the protestants a drunken triumph, and to both a peace without trade and without constitution. You have seen, in 1798, rebellion break out again, the enemy masking her expeditions in consequence of the state of Ireland, twenty millions lost, one farthing of which did not tell, in empire and blood, barbarously, boyishly, and most ingloriously expended! These things are in940your recollection. One of the causes of these things, whether efficient or instrumental, as aggravating the proscriptive system, I mean you may now remove. It is a great work. Or has ambition not enlarged your mind, or only enlarged the sphere of its action? What the best men in Ireland wished to do, but could not do, the patriot courtier and the patriot oppositionist, you may accomplish: what Mr. Gardiner, Mr. Langrishe, men who had no views of popularity or interest, or. any but the public good; what Mr. Daly, Mr. Burgh, men whom shall not pronounce to be dead if their genius live in this measure; what Mr. Forbes, every man that loved Ireland; what Lord Puy, the wisest man in Ireland ever produced; what Mr. Hutchinson, an able, accomplished, and enlightened servant of the crown; what Lord Charlemont, superior to his early prejudices, bending under years, and experience, and public affection; what that dying nobleman, what our Burke, what the most profound divines, Doctor Newcome, for instance, our late primate, his mitre stood in the front of that measure; what these men supported, and against whom? Against men who had no opinion at that time on the subject, except that which the minister ordered, or men whose opinions were so extravagant, that even bigotry must blush for them; and yet those men had not before them considerations which should make you wise&#x2014;that the pope has evaporated, and that France has covered the best part of Europe. That terrible sight is nerve before you: it is a gulph that has swallowed up a great portion of your treasure; it yawns for your being. Were it not wise, therefore, to come to a good understanding with the Irish now? It will be miserable, if any thing untoward should happen hereafter, to say, we did not foresee this danger; against other dangers, against the pope we were impregnable. But if, instead of guarding against dangers which are not, we should provide against dangers which are, the remedy is in your hands,&#x2014;the franchises of the constitution. Your ancestors of the petitioners were less fortunate; the posterity of both, born to new and strange dangers; let them agree to renounce jealousies and proscriptions, in order to oppose what, without that agreement, will overpower both. Half Europe is in battalion against us, and we are damning one another on account of mysteries, when we should form against the enemy, and march.&#x2014;But I am exhausted.", "author_id": "/people/mr-henry-grattan", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

He hoped the house, in its attention to the claims of the Duke of Atholl, would not be unmindful to the complaints of a numerous and loyal body of his majesty's subjects, though not represented in that house: and as it was the peculiar privilege of parliament as well to watch over the modes of raising money from the pockets of his majesty's subjects, as to guard with vigilance its proper disbursement, so he trusted in this case the inhabitants of the Isle of Man would not be exposed to imposts, which it was not just they should pay, at the mere fiat of the noble duke, who claimed the privilege of taxing them just as he pleased, of his own mere will and caprice; nor sutler the public money to be lavished in the payment of demands, not founded on any just or54reasonable title.

This was not the first time those claims of the noble duke were brought forward; they had been repeatedly urged, and every time in a new and different shape from the former. They came now forward upon a footing totally different from that on which they had been last submitted to his majesty's privy council, who, after four years deliberation, and after referring the subject for the judicial consideration of his majesty's attorney and solicitor general, and receiving the elaborate report of those learned gentlemen upon the subject, decided that the duke of Atholl had no right to the claims he preferred. The noble duke claimed, under the appointment of James I. a power which, he thanked God, no king of this country ever enjoyed, a power of taxing the people at his mere will. This power the house of Keys, in the Isle of Man, who are the proper representatives of the inhabitants, denied; and this was the question now at issue.

The reason why he had not had the intercourse with the then first lord of the admiralty which ought to subsist between the first lord of the admiralty and the comptroller of the navy was, that earl St. Vincent had resided mostly in the country. He had consented to superintend the stone71expedition at the desire of the secretary of state, who had written to lord St. Vincent on the subject, and received an answer conveying his lordship's approbation of the project. When the vessels were ready to sad, he wrote himself to lord St. Vincent. In all this he did not think there was any thing that could justify any reflection on his conduct. So far from having wished to make himself independent of the admiralty, he had ever wished to take the instructions of the first lord of the admiralty. As to the charge of having paid 90 days discount instead of 89, the time had been calculated from the day of the issue to the day of payment, both days inclusive, conformably to what took place in the commonest occurrences in life. A person taken into employment on one day, and discharged at the end of a month, should be paid for his time, including both the day of being engaged and the day of his discharge. The manner of issuing the navy bills had been the same as was always pursued, and it was really incomprehensible what made the committee report on this point. When the new mode of issuing navy bills had been adopted in 1796, navy bills were at a discount of 15 per cent. and on the expenditure of seven millions in 1797, there had been a saving of above a million to the public by the new mode. When the expenditure increased, the benefit had been greater. When the issue of navy bills had been made on the 24th of October, 1800, there was but 900,000l, in the treasury; and he asked in what manner the money could be so well procured?

If the house knew of what value such punctuality was to government, they would view this transaction in the light he did.

{"date": ["1805", "may", "13"], "content": "having formerly held an high official situation in Ireland (chief secretary to the lord lieutenant) felt it his duty to express the opinion on this subject which he had formed upon much reflexion. He conceived it extremely dangerous to grant to the catholics political power, except under a control, which was by no means proposed, and which it would be difficult to devise: and he thought such an experiment the more hazardous, as a language of constructive menace had been held by many noble lords of great weight, in course of this discussion, who had said that, what is asked must be granted, to preserve the country from imminent peril of fatal discord and disunion that must follow a refusal. This was a language of direct intimidation, which could not be listened to for many reasons; for nothing could tend more to remove all limits to future demand until the very superiority of power, might be claimed or assumed. The house too was exhorted and warned to concessions, not merely for the sake of interest, but of self-preservation. But on the contrary, he feared much more from the concession than the refusal. Some noble lords went so far as to insinuate pretty plainly that the house, was encouraged to venture on rejecting the petition, from a reliance on the loyalty and patience the depressed and ill-treated catholics. He would not hesitate to acknowledge his own reliance on the continued loyalty of these catholics who had hitherto maintained it; but that reliance would not be increased by increasing to the catholics political power. These oppressive restraints no longer exist; and he would so far accredit their good sense, as to think that, with all the drawbacks on their privileges so strongly enumerated, they would yet prefer the station they now hold in the empire to any risk under any change to which they might look from the interference of any foreign power. They could be no friends to the catholics who argued their cause inconsistently, as at one moment to menace the country with the privation of all aid from them without submission to their claims; and the830next, to rebuke the legislature for its want of implicit reliance on their invariable attachment. Was it wished by those who so urgently argued the necessity of uniting those four millions of catholics cordially in the national defence, that they should be considered as actuated to such a purpose, at such a crisis, by motives of self-interest only, after all the favours they have received, and all the declarations they have made? But surely a much more generous and persuasive argument would be the manifestation of precedent efforts and exertions, from genuine patriotism, instead of conditional stipulations: but nothing could be more clearly necessary than that every species of menace or alarm, of unsteadiness or apprehension, should be completely extinguished on both sides, before an arrangement so important and delicate in its permanence. Quitting the course of general reasoning, he adverted to the period of 1783&#x2013;4, when the Irish capital was in a manner in possession of the self-organised Irish volunteers. The voluntary readiness to take up arms on that occasion, which was urged particularly by the catholics as a peculiar merit, was followed by an extreme reluctance to lay them down again, after the restoration of peace. Occasional votes of thanks to those volunteers had been moved, and too readily assented to, by the Irish parliament, as, in fact, the object was to prolong the continuance of an institution not regularly acknowledged, which, in a different period, might well become a subject of great political uneasiness. This was accompanied with serious symptoms of internal disgust. But by a decisive vote of ultimate thanks to the volunteers, with a recommendation to disembody and return to the occupations of peace, in which government had the good fortune to be supported by the manly and powerful eloquence of a distinguished character (Mr. Grattan); at this moment, perhaps, supporting, with his powerful energies, in another place, the prayer of this petition, which many fear, if granted, would be more dangerous to the established constitution than were the unauthorised parades of some catholic corps of volunteers. It was about this time, too that the first bill for an Irish militia was brought forward, at the desire of government, by the late Lord Mountjoy, (who since, gallantly fell in defending his country against the fury of civil commotion); and who, though the first to bring forward the catholic petition in parliament, afterwards fell831the first victim of a rebellion, in a great degree catholic. The noble lord stated these circumstances, as well to develop the real state of the catholic body, and the origination of those indulgences which have since so rapidly succeeded each other, as to mark the objects and designs which have actuated the movements of the different members of that body. It was a great error to suppose that the idea of complete catholic emancipation from all restrictions was only hinted for the first time in 1788 or 1789. The noble lord (Grenville)who brought forward this petition, had appealed to the experience of those who had resided, in official situation, in Ireland, to speak to the catholic character and conduct. Other noble lords had ably and honourable done so; and he would now add such testimony as occurred to his own experience.&#x2014;The great change effected in the political situation of Ireland in 1782 continued unfortunately to have a lasting effect on the catholics of all descriptions, ever afterward. From these might be dated the systematic restlessness, disorder, nay, absolute disloyalty, in a large portion of the lower orders, and the growing eagerness in the higher classes for place and power. Both adopted measures but ill chosen for success; but they decidedly marked the fast hold those objects had taken on the catholic mind. They formed great expectation of advantage from the new-born independency of Ireland upon England; but shortly after, those hopes were changed to doubt, and them to despair; murmurs and complaints ensued at their meetings, and demagogues, and priests chosen from the lowest orders, educated abroad, and fraught with seditious principles, laboured to work up the minds of the people. They were taught to rely for every thing on the superiority of their numbers, and a separation from England. Relief from tithes and rents, and gain of property and provision without labour, were all to arise from this separation; and it soon become a cant word, and the bond of a dangerous union. White Boys, and other predatory associations arose, which, though soon suppressed by the vigour of government, still left behind them those germs of their principles, that never since have been quite extinguished. The weight and influence of their higher orders, and particularly of their clergy, were considerably diminished; and have never since been regained. Their lassitude and tardiness in aiding to suppress the disorders alluded to, were observable to government; and there appeared but too much cause to sus-832pect that such aid was reserved for conditional compensation. In the beginning of 1786, Dr. Butler, the titular archbishop of Cashel, and man of considerable talents and high family connexion, and then considered the great organ of the catholic cause, addressed a remonstrance to government, upon the disappointment felt by the catholics at the lapse of a whole session of parliament, without any mark of favour to them. Long sufferings, merits, and expectations were urged, and much mortification and discontent were expressed, especially as parliament was not engaged in the consideration of any foreign war, or other business of difficulty or embarrassment; and after expatiating much on their zeal in the volunteer cause, and their uniformly inoffensive and loyal conduct, the remonstrance concluded by saying, they would be satisfied for the present with some introductory privileges, such as the professions and honours of the bar and army, as preludes to the attainment of every thing else. The answer to this remonstrance expressed surprise at the matter, manner, and time of it; and at the same time reminded Dr. Butler, and through him, his community of the internal disorders and commotions them existing, excited by and confined to catholics, and most prevalent where catholic influence was the most powerful. It therefore denied the propriety of any remonstrance, expectation, or requisition for favours, while there was no mark of auxiliary exertion from the higher catholics to support the tranquillity and good order disturbed lately by their own community. Several conferences followed, which ended in an offer on the part of government to submit the claims of the catholics to parliament; but not without conditional professions of active gratitude. The hazard of such a reference was thought much greater than the probability of its success: but there was an end, for the time, to petition, and remonstrance, and soon afterwards, to the appearance of open and predatory disaffection. This was in the administration of the Duke of Rutland; and the noble lord by no means meant to charge any temptation or feeling of disloyalty in the principal catholics, but, on the contrary, to acknowledge and vindicate their loyal principles, and the many proofs of which they had shewn. But he must observe, that their unchangeable views to their great object of final emancipation from all restrictions, and even under their partial and temporary indulgences from time to time, was an obvious check upon833the voluntary and disinterested vigour of any zealous co-operation with government. The truth then seems to be, that, allowing them to be good and loyal subjects in their present situation, they have an insatiable thirst for power; and, how that might change their nature, there's the question.Grant power, And then I grant we put a sting into them That at their will they may do danger with.I cannot therefore, said the noble lord, help doubting at least, whether I should have been disposed, under such impression of still increasing claims upon every accession of favour, to have gone so far in removal of all disabilities as was done in 1793, especially in the instance of the elective franchise. It could not well be doubted by any man, who had a reasonable knowledge of human nature, and Was aware of the position and views of this particular sect, that the concession here stated would be chiefly valued as a step to the right of representation. And who can pretend to be answerable for restrictive moderation even there? Temptation, &c.; may be incited by the impulse of seeming means and opportunity, and then, in course, a dormant spirit of uneasy ambition might be roused into dangerous action.Then last it may&#x2014;prevent! And if the quarrel will bear no colour for the things they are, fashion it thus; that what they are, augmented, May run to these and these extremities, &c.;&c.;I will not apprehend a mistaken suspicion, from such allusions, that I would entertain an unfriendly, much less an illiberal estimation of the catholic character, or would be found in adverse attack upon their comforts and immunities. If the limit is drawn, where it is, I would readily agree in the opinion of the noble secretary of state (lord Hawkesbury) that we should regard without regret the concessions already made; and I would, cordially rejoice in being able to see a period of safe allowance for the grant of yet more. If I was to speak of individuals, there are many, for whom personal respect would lead me to desire the fullest gratification of their wishes. But I confine not my go thoughts within such a narrow circle: to all who by no prohibited excess or deviation from their loyalty in thought or deed are justly, entitled to the rank of fellow-subjects, I Would studiously endeavour to mark an attentive consideration and concern.&#x2014;A noble lord (Spencer) has said, that whilst any incapacities remain, there will be re-834maining restlessness and complaint. That noble lord had not surely well reflected upon the more than possible danger to arise from admission of this argument as a ground for concession. What is to be a limit or restraint upon this source of disturbance and risk to our own establishment? Incapacities are not unknown to protestants, and cannot be wholly withdrawn from catholics without surrender of even equality. But I am really inclined to think, that sufficient reflection has not been bestowed on the value of what is now in possession or enjoyed by connivance. They are not friends to the catholics, who speak of their being driven to despair, and of their groaning under long and endless oppression. Imagination often creates more sense of suffering than does reality of cause; and we are frequently led to suppose ourselves objects of pity or disregard by the mistaken or officious suggestions of pretended sympathy. If we for a moment appreciate the real case as it is, and as it is pretended it ought to be, we shall find that no penalties or restrictions remain which can be felt by the great mass of that people, and that not the grant of all which is required, would add a grain to their real wants or wishes; and in respect of the few who might be objects of supposed benefit by the further indulgences, they are excluded only from certain situations by necessary regard for our constitutional establishment, and from which, in fact, they exclude themselves by refusal to aspire to them upon equal conditions with their protestant fellow subjects.&#x2014;In justice to the liberality of the legislature, let us estimate the value of the last concession, that of the elective franchise! I cannot conceive that a more powerful incentive to habits of industry, and thereby to acquisition of property, could have been conferred; and it must be evident, that the competition was thus made more than equal in favour of the catholics. It ought also to be observed that a protestant legislature, part of it against its own immediate interests and convenience, made this in some degree at least, a sacrifice of the comparative superiority and even independence of the protestants, by the necessity imposed upon future candidates for parliament solicit the favour of even the lower orders of the catholic freeholders. At all events, the token of wish for harmony and good fellowship was manifested beyond a doubt. It is not imputable to the protestant legislature in depreciation of the real boon, that all the benefit to which it was835unquestionably conducive, was not derived from it by the objects of its participation.&#x2014;Long as there shall exist the uncontrouled dominion of factious demagogues of what ever class, but especially that of the monkish priesthood over the minds of these wretched people, they will not be suffered to exert their resources with uniform and steady attention to any pursuit best calculated for their own advantage, and for the peace and prosperity of the country. And here we may reflect perhaps with regret upon the change (to which I before alluded) in the influence of the higher over the lower orders of the catholic community, which not only weakens the constant channel of communication with government, but disables those, who are in reality time most, if not the only petitioners immediately interested on this occasion, from strengthening their pretensions by the pledge of sure responsibility for the political conduct of the whole body.&#x2014;I will not attempt to discuss the question of present relation in point of authority or subordination between the several branches of this catholic community in abstract matters of religion. This has been largely considered by other noble lords, with sufficient examination of the imperium in imperio, the catholic hierarchy. I would simply remark, that here assuredly is an instance of connivance beyond the usual cases of to legation; and I had ventured to regard it as an ever striking proof, admitted by the catholics, of the liberal forbearance of the protestant establishment. What may be the degree of danger which, in case of an allowance of catholic power, may be incurred from temptation and resources in this quarter also to assume a more independent condition and unfettered acknowledgment, is a subject worthy of very serious reflection.&#x2014;I will confess that I had persuaded myself of a remedy to all causes of uneasiness and alarm in the last great measure of an union of the kingdoms; I did expect from its accomplishment the removal of those baneful hopes of separation, which had sprung from the independence, and were, perhaps, in reality more adverse to the happiness and welfare of those. who entertained them, than essentially dangerous to those against whom they prevailed. In whatever light, therefore, of unfavourable opinion, for the sake of all parties, I had from reflection and experience regarded the measure and the effect of independence, I certainly it as itself the great demonstrative cause by evident ne-836cessity of a successful call for the resource of an union.&#x2014;The confusion and uncertainty, the speculations and excesses, in short, the total derangement (I will not use the word disorganization) consequent upon the one could not be, after such a trial, so effectually composed and harmonized by any other intervention than that of the other. It is certainly to be acknowledged, that all the good expected has not yet been experienced from this measure, especially its effect upon the quiet and industrious demeanour of the lower catholics, The peace which ensued was of too short a duration wholly to erase all idle speculation, and to fix a well regulated content; and the, recommencement of hostilities may have facilitated again the approaches of mischievous instigators, to revive the decaying embers of that miserable hope of a fallacious good, in separation from England by the help of foreign aid and maintenance &#x2014;Still, however, I venture to encourage the confident expectation, that from the union will ultimately arise a state of order and industrious exertion, which will produce more real and lasting welfare to this people, than all the imaginary promises of every good from the wildest emancipation. Neither time then, or circumstances, are now favourable to the entertainment of this petition. But it has been exclaimed, what, then! is all hope of more fortunate conjuncture, and of more auspicious situations of affairs to be extinguished, and this oppressed people to he driven to comfortless despair?&#x2014;I would answer with conscientious sincerity, that true belief, indeed, would induce me to place the measure of satisfaction best calculated for their real happiness in a supposed extinction of all views beyond the present means of comfort and prosperity. Let them be fairly estimated, cherished, and enjoyed; they wilt produce a harvest of blessings. I dare not at present presume to dream of more, which may,be good for them, or safe for us but God forbid that we should venture to circumscribe the ways of his Divine Providence, which may remove obstacles at present too strong for our attempt to clear away or pass by. There may (and I wish there may) be future reasons, however unexpected now, to prove the security with which the protestants may grant the competency of the catholics to be entrusted with the fullest participation of rights and privileges: they may, by habits of industry, good order, harmonious concord, social intercourse, mutual good-will,837and reciprocal good offices, and by zealous patriotism and loyalty. (all indeed having tendency to their own, immediate benefit, and therefore the most gratifying to the liberal spirit of the legislature) give encouragement for unrestricted confidence. They may find cause unequivocally to withdraw that barrier(insuperable, whilst it remains in force) of divided allegiance the obligation to papal supremacy, which a noble lord has most forcibly and most eloquently demonstrated to render vain all pretensions to equal rights by the want of equal conditions. I will not shut out the wish or the hope for such alteration of circumstances; but with our limited power of searching into future chance and change, we can, I think, retain this possible expectation, as the only prevention to a positive declaration, that here, even here, must Be all and the End all. We are, I am afraid, yet only on our own necessary defence. We are obliged in conscience, honour, and duty to ourselves, and to our constitution in church and state, to throw our shield of self-preservation before us, and on it to exhibit the warning motto of \"ne plus ultra.\"", "author_id": "/people/mr-thomas-orde-powlett", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},
{"date": ["1805", "may", "13"], "content": "rose to reply, and spoke in substance as follows: My lords; nothing but the duty I owe to the question and to myself, would have induced me to trouble your lordships with any observations at this late hour, In the course of what has fallen from noble lords during this debate, it has been thrown out by way of reproach, that to this petition is affixed none of the names of the catholic clergy of Ireland, and this most unjust and most unwarrantable interference has been drawn, that because they have not put their names to the petition, therefore they are not willing to subscribe to the sentiments of loyalty and attachment expressed in the petition. Now, my lords, I assert it again, and again, and am willing to lose all consideration with your lordships if I do not prove, that the contrary is the fact; if I do not prove, that they have signed the declaration themselves, and as an hierarchy have,recommended it to others. I have the means of proving before a committee of lordships, if you will let me go into committee, that the catholic clergy of Ireland are not only willing, but anxious and desirous to take the oaths prescribed by law,and that they exert themselves to persuade others to take them. This I can prove by certificates from courts of justice838in Ireland, and other concurrent testimonies. The reason alleged by the catholic clergy for not signing the present petition, and a correct and rational reason it is, is that it prays merely for the enjoyment of civil rights. Those, therefore, who are abusing and vilifying this respectable body are not judging from facts, nor can they be well-wishers to the peace and prosperity of Ireland.&#x204;My lords, a noble lord has made a distinction between the oath of the catholics of Ireland and the oath of the catholics of England. He says the difference is, that the catholics of Ireland are not willing to take the same oath as the catholics of England, and lie argues as if the catholics of England were willing to give some pledge of their loyalty which the catholics of Ireland were not willing to take. My lords, I maintain that the oath is equally binding on the catholic of Ireland as it is on the catholic of England.&#x2014;I shall now make a few short observations on what fell from a noble and learned lord (Redesdale) who spoke at considerable length the other evening. The noble and learned lord told you, that there was in the catholic church of Ireland an establishment of bishops. This, my loads, is no information to any person Who knows that the church of Ireland is episcopal, and that if you put down Roman catholic bishops, you put down the religion itself.&#x2014; But the noble and learned lord asserts, \"that they consider themselves as the only lawful successors of the ancient clergy of Ireland, assuming all the powers, and claiming all the revenues, of that clergy, treating the clergy of the reformed religion as usurpers; refusing obedience to all laws framed to curb the encroachments of the papacy on the sovereign power, and denying to the legislature of the country all power over the ranks, dignities, and authorities, and even the revenues of the church.\" My lords, I entreat your lordships to go into this committee to see whether this be true. If their own declaration is true, and that it is so I most firmly believe, they declare quite the contrary. I hope .on a point of so much importance, your lordships will afford the petitioners some opportunity of proof. The next point, as to excommunication: the noble and learned lord says, \"the authority of the Roman catholic clergy deer their flock is enforced by the most dreadful of all means; by the power of excommunication, a power very different from that possessed by the established church.\" I appeal to the right reverend bench opposite, whether it be pos-839sible that any church can subsist, unless it possess the power of shutting those out of to who break the the church, and act contrary to them.&#x2014;The noble and learned lord has also stigmatized the Roman catholic clergy of Ireland, \"as an unauthorised hierarchy, lifting themselves up in defiance of the law, and of all constitutional authority.\" He says, that \"reigning uncontroled, their ecclesiastical courts govern the whole people; that they dissolve marriages for causes not allowed by law&#x2014;procontract consanguinity, or affinity, in degrees beyond those prescribed by the legislature; that they license marriages within those,degrees; that the evidence of marriage is wholly in their power; and that the legitimacy of children, and the succession to property, is under their control.\" My lords, let the noble and learned lord bring forth his proofs. If he can produce them, sure I am, that every person who hears me will cordially and anxiously join with him in finding the remedy. And if, in the course of your enquiry, you should discover four or five ignorant parish priests who have exceeded the limits of their duty, I will say then also, apply the remedy, go into the committee, and do not impute that to a whole body of men, which proceeds only from a few ignorant individuals. My lords, that such expressions should go forth to the world as proceeding from such a quarter is, in my mind, the greatest evil that can possibly arise from the present discussion. I will venture to say, that if you will turn your attention to the means of rendering the condition of Ireland more conducive to the happiness of the people, instead of vilifying and degrading the hierarchy, you, must begin by respecting that hierarchy, and to make that useful and respectable class of men respected by those over whom they are to exercise their authority, you must secure to it an influence over those whom by law yon cannot change, but to whom they will look, as their spiritual directors. Those who endeavour to effect this are practically the greatest benefactors to the empire, of which Ireland now forms so essential a part.&#x2014;To the rest of the noble and learned lord's speech, I must decline offering any reply. Sorry I am to have heard that speech in this house; but more sorry, that it should go out to the world, that a person holding such opinions still continues in a situation of such great importance to the peace and tranquillity of the united empire! The noble and learned lord has also said, and, in which sentiment I perfectly agree with him,840that if the claims of this petition are granted something further must also be done. I was told on a former night, that I had left something unexplained; that there was something more in my mind than what is expressed in the prayer of the petition. My lords, there is something more in my mind. I was not so weak as to suppose, that the placing a few persons in offices would have the effect of calming the minds of the people of Ireland. I Well know that much must be done; and my opinion is, that many provisions and regulations must necessarily accompany the granting the prayer of your it petitioners. But, I know of no manner in which it can be done so effectually, as by making this committee the ground work of those proceedings. One noble lord told us, that there had been no county meetings, nothing to convince us that the measure proposed is loudly called by the majority of the people. Surely, my lords, it is much to the credit of the petitioners, that there has been no clamour on this occasion. The pride of the petitioners has been, that they have exerted themselves to prevent that clamour, and to bring their petition before your lordships in that decent and respectful manner, which I conceive they have done.&#x2014;Another objection, is, that it has been brought forward in a time of war. My lords, if there be danger, let us look that danger in the face. If this measure is ultimately right to be adopted, what time can be more proper than the present moment, when we are encompassed by dangers on every side, and when you are obliged to give up a part of your militia for the sake of increasing your disposeable force? I, therefore, call upon your lordships to lay aside all vain pretence, and if it be a good thing to do, do it in that moment when, of all others, it will be most serviceable to the country, and most welcome to your petitioners.&#x2014;To those who think that the measure is so radically bad, that it never can be adopted, I would just say a few words. They talk of the bill of rights, the reformation, the title of the crown, and all that. But does any man living believe, that if we were to adopt the proposal of suffering Irish catholics to sit in parliament, it would in any shape whatever tend to destroy the reformed religion of this country? Surely, there must be great want of argument, when you are obliged to resort to such sophisms as this against the proposed measure! No blessing can light upon counsels conducted upon such principles.&#x2014;Now, my lords, I come to the question, is it safe to give the catholics that which they ask?841And, what is the danger that could possibly arise from so doing? We are told that the catholics differ from all other sects. You may endure dissenters, you may endure men of no religion, but you may not endure the catholics, because they do not acknowledge the king's supremacy. Great stress has been laid upon the objection on the part of the petitioners to take this oath; and this very circumstance, did no other consideration apply, would abundantly and clearly expose the falsity, inconsistency, and absurdity of the assertion, that the petitioners hold as an article of their creed, \"that no faith is to be kept with heretics.\" Nothing now, it has been observed, in the course of this debate, remains to exclude the catholics from a full participation of the benefits of the constitution, but their sanctimonious regard for the dictates of an oath! And yet, up to this very hour, we have been told, that catholics consider themselves as not obliged to keep faith with heretics, and, consequently, pay no regard to the oaths they take with them. But this is not all. Let your lordships consider what this much talked of oath is in reality and in fact. Perhaps, many who talk so loudly of it, are far from understanding it. In point of fact, the oath of supremacy, as it now stands is not positive but negative. It does not assert that the king is the supreme head of the church, but that no foreign prince is so to be considered. It has been repeatedly argued and demonstrated, that the sense in which the Roman catholics regard the pope as supreme head of the church, is a theological, not a political consideration.&#x2014;I shall not detain your lordships at this late hour with any further observations. If no other service is derived from the agitation of this question, this good will undoubtedly arise from it: that after all the letters and pamphlets which have been written against the catholics, it will be clear to the conviction of your lordships, that, from all their professions and all their declarations, doctrines have been insisted upon, which were never entertained by the persons to whom they have been attributed. The catholics will go from your bar acquitted by the most enlightened assembly The question of actual attachment will never enter into. But this I must say, that with very little exception, there has been an almost unanimous agreement, as to the loyalty and attachment of that body. The argument of one noble lord, who spoke early in the debate of this night (the earl of Buckinghamshire) is inconsistent and absurd in the extreme. The noble earl said, that \"his Majesty had not in his842dominions a set of men more sincerely attached, or better affected to his person and government, than the noblemen and gentlemen who represent the catholic body in Ireland; but,\" added the noble earl, \"these noblemen and gentlemen have long ceased to have any influence over the great mass of the Roman catholics in Ireland.\" Why then, I would ask, should we hesitate to grant the prayer of the petition, which goes to affect a comparatively small number of persons, and who are described as loyal and faithful subjects, and yet grant to the lower orders of the great body of the Irish catholics, reputedly a contaminated mass, ever thing they can reasonably enjoy under the constitution? The argument of the noble earl involves this farther inconsistency. He entertains fears that great catholic proprietors would soon exclusively be returned for the counties, by a great majority of the catholic freeholders; and yet, almost in the same breath, he asserts, that persons of that description have ceased to have any influence over the great body of the Roman catholics! Yet, entertaining so high an opinion of these noblemen and gentlemen, these are they on whom and on whom alone, you are desirous of placing these restraints. To presbyterians you give a full participation in the blessings of your constitution. From them yon withhold nothing. Yet, from the catholic noblemen and gentlemen of Ireland you withhold every thing. My Lords, how can this be reconciled with any principle of reason or of justice? How can you withhold these blessings from men who have risked their lives in defence of their country, and in defence of those laws in which they earnestly pray to be made joint partakers? You owe much to the zeal, the loyalty, and the active exertions of the protestants of Ireland, but to no set of men do you owe more than to the catholic noblemen and gentry from whom you withhold these privileges. I hope I have proved, that you have nothing to fear from granting the prayer of this petition. If you have any thing to fear, the way is to give up those distinctions which .at present exist. The true way to meet that danger is by doing away those distinctions, and firmly untiring those two bodies into one trust, I have also proved, that there is throughout your empire, no outpost so vulnerable as Ireland. It is an old citadel, whose superstructure you yourselves have demolished; but as for shelter, at present it affords you none! My lords, I have no more to say, I am ashamed at this late hour to have trespassed so long upon your time. I do entertain a belief,843that the force of reason, like the rays of the sun, breaking in upon us, and that the day is not far distant, when she will triumph over all prejudices, and will produce a decision favourable to the cause of your petitioners. I am persuaded, that the agitation of this question will be of service, that an impression will be made on the minds of the catholics that there is a growing desire to examine their case, and that whatever degree of prejudice may still prevail amongst us, there is nevertheless, so much liberality, that the catholics will retire from your bar confident of ultimate success.", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-grenville", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},

He declared, on his honour, that he did not act through party motives, he was an unconnected individual, not belonging to any man or set of men; his conduct arose from his feelings for the situation of the country, and his knowledge where the faults were imputable, with respect to the administration of earl St. Vincent.

If the hon. gent. said all this from his own suggestion, it was a pity that he was not a lord of the admiralty, by which he might have obtained greater information than he probably now possessed. The lights, however, which he professed to have obtained, and the decisive line of conduct he had adopted, were rather strange in an independent country gentleman, professing himself to be unconnected with any party. It was equally strange too, that no attack whatever had been made against earl St. Vincent until he adopted measures which tended to attack others. The proceedings of this day were certainly a good warning to any man to be very careful how he ventured to attack abuses. If the hon. gent. had indeed been a party man, instead of an unconnected gentleman, as he described himself, he might have been suspected of having taken a very dexterous way to divert the attention of the house from the other enquiries already going forward; but he could not consider it altogether fair in this unconnected man to assert that he could prove earl St. Vincent to have disgraced the navy, and have been an enemy to his country. After he had heard the minister himself object to some of those pipers which might turn out to be the most necessary for the noble earl's defence; let the fair and full enquiry be granted; and if any of the papers required should appear of too delicate a nature to be made public, let the enquiry be a secret one. At the present moment, indeed, the friends of the earl St. Vincent did not appear to be very numerous in that house; nor were they much wanting to a man who might safely rest his character on the sentiments of a grateful and affectionate people.

He thought he had a right to expect, that the right hon. gent.

When he heard so illustrious a character reviled, without any appeal to former friendship, to extend towards it the protection of his own opinion, was no more than what was due from one great man in a high734situation to another. They differed indeed in their opinions, on the best means of naval administration; but he should not have thought that a reason why he should so abandon him in every other respect. A fair and manly hostility to the noble earl, like that of the unconnected individual, would, in his opinion, be more becoming in the right hon. gent. than the grant of papers, professing to brand the noble earl in the manner expressed by his present adversary. This was not a charge that respected any particular expedition, or partial failure, but a broad accusation, which ought either to be sifted to the bottom, or all documents be refused upon it.

Thee fairness he claimed on the part of the earl St. Vincent was, that whatever objections there might be in point of convenience, all the papers should be produced which might be necessary for the enquiry. The hon. gent. (Mr. Jeffery) seemed surprised, that any gentleman should oppose the papers, without knowing what they were; but he forgot, that when the papers should be produced, it would be too late to oppose them. He acted, in this respect, like the judge, who was reported to have told a barrister from the bench&#x2014;\"I will not allow you to open your mouth, until you tell me what you have to say.\" As to the right hon. gent. (Mr. Pitt), he must do him the justice to say, that he acted consistently, and he had uniformly expressed himself hostile to the naval administration of the earl St. Vincent.", "author_id": "/people/mr-charles-grey-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

The right hon. gent. then said, that the disproportion Which before existed between the persons professing958the catholic and protestant religion in Ireland being done away by this measure, afforded a chance that the same objection would not be made to the catholics having a full participation in the British constitution. That speech, many of us knew, made, a very deep impression on the minds of the Irish catholics; and, having carefully attended to all the debates which took place at that time, I could not help observing, that there was no gentleman in this house who made a stand upon that point, or endeavoured to obtain a pledge either way upon it.

At present, thought I am from principle determined to support the motion since it has been submitted, I must now declare, that I think it Wrong in the Roman catholics to bring it forward at this moment. I should even support the repeal of the test to the dissenters, if that were now the question; though, undoubtedly, the argument of numbers does not apply to them in the same manner as it does to the Roman catholics of Ireland, who in point of rights, must be acknowledge to be one short of their due proportion. When you consider, that, on the lowest calculation, the catholics of Ireland compose three millions out of five of the inhabitants of that country, and are rapidly, increasing in wealth and consequence, you cannot shut your eyes to their situation, and your own, sense must make up your mind to grant at some time what is impossible to be avoided. I freely confess, that I have not the least idea of the measure succeeding at present, and am very well convinced that the Roman catholics themselves do not expect it. In their private conversation, they do not affect to think that their wishes will be immediately complied with. They say, that in time it will work its way, by the force of reason, but that they cannot expect the protestants at once to throw away those bulwarks which they so carefully raised against them. The effect of it is sure, however slowly it may operate. I remember myself, that when a bill was brought into the959Irish parliament, for the purpose of indulgence to the catholics, there were only thirteen members in the house who voted in favour of it; and yet such was the general agitation, and such the strong sensations excited by its agitation, that the government was soon convinced that something must be done upon it. The country at that time was not well governed; and, towards the approach of the ensuing session of parliament, when it was expected the measure would again be brought forward, emissaries were sent down by the administration to procure resolutions and petitions from the different county grand juries against it; and they succeeded. But the catholics seeing no hope of success when the Irish government was against them, came over to England and petitioned the throne. Every thing was in readiness for opening the sessions of the Irish parliament. The speech from the throne was prepared, and every resistance to the catholic claims determined on. But his majesty was graciously pleased to favour the petition, and an alteration for the intended speech was transmitted to Ireland, with a recommendation in favour of the catholics. The change of opinion that took place was equally violent and sudden. These very grand juries in the different countries who had assembled, and agreed in resolutions against the claims of the catholics, in a short time after were themselves the first who voted in their favour:&#x2014;and thus the grand juries and the parliament were disgraced. I remember when I was laughed at for saying the catholic claims must be granted, by many of those persons who in a very short time afterwards voted in their favour. The Irish parliament, in my opinion, acted on that occasion with great prudence, in not granting them the whole of what they asked for at once; and so much inclined am I to this gradual extension of privileges, that, should the house go into a committee on the petition, I should be averse to granting all their demands, though I would agree to members of that religion sitting in both houses. No man, who values the constitution, can approve of three millions of his fellow subjects being unrepresented in the parliament; but it was very well argued by the hon. mover of this question, that the catholic body is not even virtually represented, though the members of it are allowed to possess the elective franchise. I will even put it to the learned and hon. gent. near me (Dr. Duigenan), whether, if his con-960stituents were of that persuasion, he could be considered as the organ of the Catholics? My hon. friend may be a Very good protestant; but certainly no very fit representative for the catholics. All the evils apprehended from giving them seats in parliament, are now no more than fanciful and chimerical. It was formerly said, if you give the catholics the elective franchise, the consequence will be that they will vote for no member without putting him to a test that he will be obedient to their purposes. But they have since obtained the franchise, and no such tests or other consequences have been known to happen. It turned out to be no more than a phantom of distant danger, which vanished as you approached it. All the danger that can happen has already been incurred. You have given suffrages to, and put arms into the hands of, persons but slightly educated, and most liable to entertain the prejudices you are so much afraid of; and refuse privileges to the higher orders, whose minds are enlightened, whose principles are more sound, and who possess the greatest stakes in the country&#x2014;My hon. friend has at all times opposed the catholic claims, not as a question of policy, but as a question of religion, and in support of his opinions he goes back to musty records and obsolete councils, and the ages of ignorance and bigotry. But will any man in his senses seriously compare the opinions of the catholics of the eleventh with those of the nineteenth century? Have not the protestants themselves changed their tenets and opinions with the revolutions of time? Are there not new sects of dissenters springing up every day? In this age of rapid and progressive improvement and cultivation of the intellect, are we to be gravely told, that the catholic mind alone stands still, and that the people of this day are to be convicted because their ancestors 600 years ago were bigots? If so, let me ask again, who is the man amongst us who might not be equally condemned upon the same principle? While arts, sciences, and manufactures, improve, it would be hard if the human mind alone, and peculiarly the catholic mind, remained where it was, and that men in this age should be tried by a few foolish resolutions passed in the council of Lateran. It has been said, that if the catholics were once admitted to an equal participation of rights, their first step would be, to overthrow the protestant government. I, however, am so far of a contrary opinion, that I can. never conceive the union of the961two countries, or British connexion, safe while three millions of our fellow-subjects are held in political bondage. The strongest security you can give to the protestant establishment, is to reconcile to it three millions of your fellow-subjects, who conceive that they are unfairly treated. Nothing appears to me so evil, so extravagant, and so unreasonable, as to suppose you can keep such multitudes always quiet, unless you are determined to redress them. Nor was there ever any thing more difficult for you to do, than to legislate for those whom you refuse to reconcile, and to whom, according to the speech of the hon. member, never under any circumstances can further concessions be made, nor any change be effected on the protestant mind in their favour. Many persons have expressed their surprise, that although the reformation extended itself so rapidly in England, it made so little and such slow progress in Ireland; but a little reflection will soon resolve this problem. It is allowed that the same means have not been used in one country as in the other, for making the reformation take root. We have records and testimonies in abundance, to show that in times comparatively remote, Ireland was conspicuous for its civilization and literature; nut the reign of Henry VIII., when the reformation commenced, was one of the darkest ages of that country. There was another cause which did not less operate against the progress of reform. When the monarch already mentioned first attempted to extend it in Ireland, it appeared, from the letter addressed to him on that occasion by the Irish master of the rolls, that the sovereign's government did not extend beyond twenty miles from Dublin, and of course his influence was proportionably contracted. It was bad policy to attempt at the same time the conquest and the reformation of the country; and yet the reformer travelled with the sword in one hand and the reform in the other. It is therefore manifest that the regular order was inverted; for the king should have conquered the country first, and endeavoured to convert the inhabitants afterwards. Here the reformations was propagated by argument and reason. The reformers preached to the people in their own language; they listened to the voice of reason, and were in time convinced. In Ireland the reformed religion was preached in a language not understand the natives. The method taken was, to propagate it by the sword, which has seldom proved the962fittest instrument for making proselytes. In England the king had no competitor, and easily diffused his reformation amongst the people; in Ireland he possessed but a very limited authority and the doctrines he wished to enforce were considered as coming from an enemy at open war with the people, their habits, customs, and prejudices, and therefore were opposed and resisted by them. The impolitic oppression exercised in Ireland was a further obstacle to its progress. Henry passed a law prohibiting the English settlers from intermarrying or fostering with the natives. As this word fostering has an application in Ireland different from what it has here, it may be right to explain that it refers to the poorer son of the females suckling the children of the rich, which in that country, is productive of a kind of intimate intercourse and connexion. It is also to be observed, that it was the same parliament of Henry that promulgated the reformation, which also passed this prohibiting act, which violated all the manners and customs of the people. In every respect the proceedings in the two countries were so extremely different, that the reformation was not allowed the same play in the one that it was in the other. When the king thought proper to shut up the monasteries, and destroy the monastic livings in England, he bestowed them, by grant, upon great landed men of considerable property, who commanded the respect of the people. In Ireland, in the contrary, he bestowed them on English settler, and needy adventurers, whose interests were constantly at variance with those of the people.&#x2014;Though the territory of the government, as I observed before, extended no further than twenty miles from Dublin, yet bishops and other clergy were sent over, who never thought of residing on their benefices; and instead of propagating their doctrines, had, in fact, no connexion whatever with the inhabitants. If the religion then adopted had been at that early period taught in Ireland, it would, no doubts, have had pretty nearly the same effect that it had here; but, in that country, it does not appear that any one ever attempted to teach it; nor was the protestant religion ever tendered to the people, except in the form of an act of parliament. But if Henry failed in the mode which be adopted for propagating the reformation amongst a people who could not understand a word of the English language, Queen Elizabeth bit upon a most notable project to remedy the defect; for,963as the native, Irish spoke no language but their own, and could not understand English, she ordered the Bible to be translated for them into Latin, and the church service to be performed in that language. It was well said by lord Clare, that any attempt to force men's consciences only made them hypocrites; and we find that force, instead of argument, was the instrument employed in Ireland. A law was passed, by which the eldest son of a catholic, who had a landed estate, might, by turning protestant, dispossess his father. What could be more detestable than this law, which was so well calculated to revolt the feelings of the people, by an unnatural power given to a son to shake off the dominion of his parent? This bribe, however, was not confined only to the eldest; but the youngest, or any other son, was also, by his conversion, afforded the bribe of seizing on his father's estates, and letting it gavel between him and his eldest brother. In this way it will be allowed, that both the king and his parliament took a most irreligious method of extending their religion, and prepared their converts for being good protestants, by first making them bad men. The free tenets of the protestant religion are of that kind that will always extend themselves with the progress of civilization; but you took the very worst mode of effecting this in Ireland. By prohibiting the education of Roman Catholics at home, and excluding them from the university of Dublin, you have compelled the parents to send their children abroad, to be educated in foreign countries, where they were, of course, brought up in all the prejudices of the catholic religion, or, in other words, of popery. There were also several other acts which had a similar, and, perhaps, an equal tendency; but I shall not detain the house by reasoning on them at present. One great and leading objection which I have heard stated against the admission of catholics into parliament is, that the pope is allowed to have more power in Ireland than he is possessed of in other catholic countries; and by appointing the catholic bishops, he maintains that supremacy in the church which of legal right belongs only to his Majesty. I confess this objection has much weight with me&#x2014;and I can see no reason why the Catholics should not come prepared to concede some of their prejudices, when they call upon us to concede ours. This, in fact, seems to be the grand obstacle to the concessions they wish for; and I am not without sanguine hopes that it may be re-964moved. Upon this subject I made it my business to converse with some catholic gentlemen of no small authority, and asked them whether they would have any objection to the bishops of their persuasion being nominated by his Majesty instead of the pope? And they all agreed that they could have no objection to it. What I should propose would be, that hereafter, whenever a see became vacant, the other bishops should assemble, and choose two or more candidates, whom they would recommend to that appointment, and leave the choice of the person to be determined by the king. Indeed I have good reason to believe, that, if the prayer of the petition was granted, the Roman catholics would cheerfully give up that point (A cry of hear! hear! from Mr. Fox and those members who surrounded him), as well as make whatever other reasonable sacrifices the circumstances of the case may be thought to require; for I must maintain, that they can have no right to seats in parliament, while they continue to take their bishops from the hands of any foreign power. I cannot, however, but think that the Catholics would be very well satisfied with this arrangement, and I make but little doubt that many of the opposers of their emancipation would relax in resistance, and consent to agree to it, upon this condition. To speak plainly, indeed, I should wish to ask of the hon. gent. (Mr. Fox), who must be in the confidence of these gentlemen, by their selecting him to present their petition, to what extent the catholics would go in this respect, and what are the points which they would have no objection to give up? I hope the house will bear in mind, that when these Roman catholic laws were passed, they were not directed against the catholics as such, but were laws enacted against popery and slavery; for James II. who was the source of them all, was himself a tyrant and a bigot. The laws, therefore, wore a double aspect, as intending to protect the subjects of these realms against both. As to the prospects generally attributed to Roman catholics, for the subversion of property in Ireland, I am, in my own mind, perfectly convinced that they do not entertain the most distant idea of ever restoring the estates that were confiscated from their ancestors. The best proof, perhaps, that could be given of this is that since the Roman catholics of Ireland have been allowed the liberty of purchasing lands, they have almost invariably been solicitous of purchasing those that formerly be965longed to their forefathers, which they certainly would not do if they cherished the hope of ever receiving them back in any other manner. I once very strictly inquired of a lawyer in Ireland, a Mr. Sankey, who was very much employed in making these purchases of forfeited estates, whether he knew any instance of the descendants making any objection to the tenures by which such forfeited estates were held? His reply was, that he never once knew a single instance of it. It is a vulgar error into which the learned gentleman (Dr. Duigenan) has fallen, when he told us that the Catholics of Ireland had maps, by which they could trace the boundaries of the estates once possessed by their ancestors, in the expectation that they would, on some future day, have an opportunity of reclaiming them. The fact is, sir, that the map of all these forfeited lands is kept by the auditor in the castle of Dublin, is accessible to every man who chooses to inspect it, and is daily produced in the courts, to ascertain disputes respecting boundaries. The history of this map is pretty well known. It was drawn by Sir William Petty, after the old one had been taken away by king James II and carried into France, where an accredited agent from this government (General Vallancy) was some time since sent to procure a copy of it: it is comprised in twenty-four folio volumes: and from this it will be seen, how idle the story is, that catholics are at the trouble of keeping maps privately, with sinister views, when the real one is accessible to any one who applies for it. The great point then, sir, which I have in view, is to show, that, as the reformation, now in existence nearly 300 years, has hitherto made such slow progress in Ireland, (for there are still three millions of catholics in that country unconverted,) hence it is obvious that the system you have adopted has failed of its effects, that it must of course be wrong, and that it is high time to change it. The surest method we can take to advance the reformation is, by treading back the steps of our ancestors, and by undoing much of what they have done. If then we are to measure back the steps of three hundred years, we cannot be surprised if much time shall be required in advancing. One thing, however, is clear; that if we expect to convert three millions of people into good protestants, it must be done by argument, and not by force. This great question has now for the first time come before us, and I trust the full discussion it has undergone,966and the moderation and sound argument displayed by its advocates, will not fail to have their due weight, and to conquer in due time here, as they have before done in Ireland, the prejudices existing against a measure, which, I am thoroughly convinced, would consolidate the strength, unite the attachments, and render impregnable the security of these realms.", "author_id": "/people/mr-edward-lee", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1805", "may", "14"], "content": "after some prelimiminary observations, spoke in substance as follows:&#x2014;The hon. mover of this question has affected to distinguish between the civil and religious institutions of the country, as if they were capable of complete separation: the practice, however, of all civilized states, has fully demonstrated that they are so intimately united, that to attempt to sever them would be in reality to destroy them. A luminous and eloquent political philosopher (Mr. Burke) entertained ideas directly opposed to such a doctrine. \"This principle\" (that of attachment in the people of England to their religious national establishment) \"runs through the whole system of their polity. They do not consider their church establishment as convenient, but as essential to their state; not as a thing heterogeneous and separable; something added for accommodation; what they may either keep up or lay aside, according to their temporary ideas of convenience. They consider it as the foundation of their whole constitution, with which, and with every part of which, it holds an indissoluble union. Church and state are ideas inseparable in their minds, and scarcely is the one ever mentioned without the other.\" They are so far joined, that the idea of the one almost necessarily impresses upon us the recollection of the other; and church and state so imperceptibly flow into each other, that the connexion, even to the organ of speech, is perfectly familiar. This fraternal relation is not a novelty in our history, it grew up in the most early periods of it, and was firmly combined in those times when the liberties of this nation were effectually secured. After our sacred institution had endured many desperate assaults, it rose with renewed strength from the conflict, and we were destined to enjoy the blessings not only of a free but of a protestant constitution. In the same charter in which the sovereign appointment was given, in which the rights of the subject are declared, it was said, this kingdom shall be for ever protestant. And \"esto perpetua\" is the earnest prayer I shall offer967for the Safety and happiness of my country. But the principles now advanced are calculated not to preserve, but to impair the constitution we have received from our ancestors, and to sacrifice to experiment the invaluable privileges by which we have been hitherto distinguished. By what provisions is this constitution to be secured? By the fundamental laws of the country. What are these laws? The king must be a protestant. He can marry none but a protestant. Was this to lull to repose the conscience of the sovereign? Was it for his personal comfort in this life, or his happiness hereafter, that these restrictions on his very thoughts were ordained? Certainly with no such design: it was for the protection of these realms from the dangerous consequences of catholic innovation. It was, in such a country as this, guarded by such legislative precautions, with regard to, the opinions of the prince, that if no distinct provisions had been made, the general maxims resulting from established law, would be, that all the great officers of state assisting the monarch in the discharge of his high functions should be protestants. It was required, that the supreme magistrate should be of that persuasion; and were not the representatives of his august power to entertain the same religious sentiments? In order to preserve the system inviolable, it is not only expedient, but necessary: whatever may be the situation or the policy of other states in this particular, in England it is prudent, from peculiar circumstances, to preserve this restraint; because, from the nature of our limited monarchy, the incumbent of the throne may be in the exercise of a very small portion of power; almost the whole actual authority, and the responsibility, may be delegated to his ministers; and what would be the perils that might await us, if they were the slaves of the catholic superstition? It is on such grounds that I consider it not a matter of doubt, but of conviction and certainty, that to permit these privileges to be extended to persons of the romish faith, would be to infringe the fundamental maxims of our glorious constitution. A protestant king, surrounded by catholic ministers, would be a solecism in fact, as, well as in law; for their must be a perpetual contradiction between the duties of the one and the other. It is an important function of the great officers of state to attend with zeal and vigilance to the protection of our church establishment; but968how could this obligation be discharged by those who deem it to be absurd, pernicious, profane, and fanatical? It is true, I am not enabled, as many others are, from intimate and local knowledge, to speak to the present question; but if the premises I have assumed are at all correct, the objection to the motion before the house is paramount to all the inferior circumstances of accident and locality. The hon. gent. (Mr. Fox), in his introductory address, told the house, that from some unfavourable events, the grants already made had produced the effect that might have been naturally expected; and this disappointment he used as an argument for new concessions. In my mind, it operates in a way precisely the reverse: if what has been already given has not been beneficial to the persons to whom the donation was extended, there is little expectation that by them any future advantage from the proposition will be derived. An hon. member, who is an eloquent advocate of the cause he asserts, (Mr. Grattan), has intimated there would be danger of separation between the sister islands, if this motion were rejected. In such a declaration he may have said much for the courage, but very little in favour of the loyalty, of the people of Ireland. I had hoped we should rather have seen some proofs of their gratitude and attachment for what has been conceded, than any indications of disgust and alienation for what is with-held. If I may make a comparative observation on the feelings of the catholies of the two countries, I should consider the disposition manifested by the English papists as much the more honourable, although the laws now complained of are more onerous to the English than to the Irish of that profession. The proportion of gentlemen of distinguished families, who are catholics, is much greater among the former than among the latter; and hence the laws which restrict them from the executive and legislative situations are to them peculiarly severe. It has been said, that the subjects of that persuasion are deprived of their civil rights. True it is that one of the princes of the house of Stuart has been driven from the throne for misconduct, but upon what principle were his successors excluded? It was because they were attached to the popish religion; the protestant faith has become necessary part of our constitution, and we could not be governed by those who were inimical to it. The house has heard969much of virtual representation, and it is pretended the catholics of Ireland are not represented; but nothing is more manifest than that they are admitted to the complete exercise of the elective franchise: and in this respect, at least, they enjoy every privilege possessed by protestants. I have understood that the hon. mover of this question is preparing the history of a very important and eventful period in the annals of this country. The favourite chapter to which I should direct his attention with peculiar pleasure, would be that in which so enlightened an author must contemplate the benign effects of the protestant religion, as conducive to the peace, order, and happiness of the community, and to the integrity and glory of the British constitution. The true question now is, if the privileges granted to catholics are to be extended? The parliament of Ireland has acted with great wisdom in regard to this enquiry, and has granted to them all that was either necessary or discreet. But the hon. gent., on the contrary, says, because we have given so much, we ought liberally to make them a present of the rest. The converse of this I shall rather maintain, because he cannot consider former generosity as a just motive for future prodigality.&#x2014; However, if more should be fit to be conceded, a reason less inconvenient might be easily discovered for the donation. The discretion of our ancestors has erected a strong barrier to protect the constitution; but we are now required to admit the catholics, and for this purpose to hurl down this stupendous monument of their industry and wisdom, to which I can never agree.", "author_id": "/people/sir-william-scott-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

But whatever satisfaction I should feel in agreeing with him on other occasions, I should indeed be sorry if I did nut differ970from him on the question of this night. For I could not look with the same pleasure to our happy constitution, which is justly the pride of this country and the envy of the world, if I could suppose it compatible with its principles, that so great a proportion of my fellow-subjects should be put under the ban of the empire, and eternally excluded from the most valuable of its privileges. It appears to me a most glaring inconsistency on the face of the proposition itself, that an equality of rights and of protection should be, for ever, denied to the catholics, at the same time that an equality of duty and allegiance is demanded from them. My right hon. and learned friend has drawn arguments in support of his opinion from the principles of our constitution, as laid down in the settlement which followed the glorious revolution. But here he has not exercised his usual fairness and candour. He has rested all his reasoning on a single, indefinite, and equivocal word, of negative description, which seems to favour his position, while he has passed over all that part of what he calls the charter of the revolution, which would at once have shewn the fallacy of the whole argument. According to him, the fundamental principle of our constitution, as then established, requires merely that the king should be a protestant, and marry a protestant; and thence is deduced the conclusion, that all the great officers of state to whom the exercise of the royal functions is delegated, and every member of every branch of the legislature must be also protestants. But is not the position with which nay right hon. and learned friend sets out, a plain sophism? It contains indeed the truth, but not the whole truth. Lutherans, Zuinglians and Calvinists, Baptists and Anabaptists, Quakers and Menonites, Muggletonians, Swedenburgians, and I know not how many sects beside, are all of them protestants: but does my right hon. and learned friend mean to say, that a monarch, who should profess himself to belong to any of those protestant sects, could lawfully hold the crown of this realm? I am sure, he does not. By the coronation oath, by the act which settled the succession in his majesty's august house, the king is as much bound to be a member of the church of England as established by law, to the exclusion of all other protestant churches, as he is forbidden to hold communion with the see or church of Rome. The consequences therefore, which follow from those fundamental laws of the state must operate equally971against one description of dissenters as against another, against protestant and papist alike. My right hon. and learned friend must push his argument of proscription to the same length against both (and he has not attempted it; he could not attempt it), or the argument is good for nothing against either.&#x2014;As an authority of the greatest weight in support of his position, my right hon. and learned friend has had recourse to a celebrated work of an illustrious friend of mine, now no more; whose memory will ever be cherished next my heart; whose virtues as well as talents will ever live in my fondest regard and most reverential admiration; a political philosopher, no less enlightened than eloquent, as my right hon. and learned friend has truly described him; a statesman, whose loss his country has every day more and more reason to deplore, as a public calamity. In these feelings I know that my right hon. and learned friend fully participates. He assents to the observation. I would, sir, that I could have had the gratification of tracing what he now avows, in the use, which he has just made, of the beautiful passage extracted from \"The Reflexions on the French Revolution.\" For how is it applied in the context, where it stands? In any I way, that bears upon the present question? No, sir; not in the most remote degree. It merely asserts the close and intimate connexion of a religious national establishment with the civil constitution of the state, in the system of polity derived to us from our ancestors; holding up the example of this country in contrast to the conduct of the demagogues in the national assembly of France, who were systematically plundering, defrauding, vilifying, degrading, and persecuting the ministers of the very religion, Which they at the same time professed to acknowledge as the national church. It has no immediate reference to the peculiar and distinctive character of our religious establishments. But my right hon. and learned friend has violently torn it from its place, to make it the foundation of his objections to the present measure of relief; a measure Which the great authority himself, to whom he appeals, never ceased from his first entrance into public life to the moment of his death, to recommend and to urge as the surest means of improving and consolidating the prosperity and strength of the empire. Nearly half a volume in the collection of Mr. Burke's works is occupied with the discussion of the very subject, on which we are how engaged. My right hon.972and learned friend must have known this. He is too sincere an admirer and too diligent a reader of the compositions of his deceased friend (for such he was) to have overlooked so large a portion of his labours. But in truth, sir, he has only manifested his accustomed judgement and discretion in not directing your attention to that quarter. For there you will find the whole speech of my right hon. and learned friend, anticipated, and will he allow me to say? triumphantly confuted: there, while it is again admitted to be a fundamental law of the constitution, that the church of England should be united and even identified with it, yet a just and solid distinction is drawn between fundamental laws themselves, and laws of regulation only, made from time to time for the support of what is fundamental; there, the radical defect of the argument which represents the king as simply a protestant, instead of a communicant of the church of England, is largely examined, detected, and exposed; there in short, the errors, into which my right hon. and learned friend appears to me to have fallen, are attributed to a confusion of reasoning most alien to minds like his, and belonging only \"to the metaphysicians of our times, who are the most foolish of men, and who, dealing in universals and essences, see no difference between more and less.\" Indeed, sir, after all, I very much fear, that my right hon. and learned, friend has only been dressing up in more decent apparel a set of idle vagabond fallacies which have been already more than once whipped through the town as public cheats and impostors. I cannot however dismiss this topic without one word of serious complaint, painful as it is to me to address it where I must, on behalf of him, whose voice is now for ever mute in the grave; I cannot refrain from declaring at once my surprise and my affliction, that, from one, whom he esteemed, and who esteemed him, he should now experience the treatment, which he was too much used to receive during his life from the least respectable of his adversaries; that his opinions should be imperfectly and partially, quoted, to hold him up to the world, as inconsistent with himself &#x2014;But let us, now, sir, look a little into history: let us see at what period those incapacitating statutes, from Which the catholics most wish to be relieved, had their origin: let us more especially enquire when the doors of this house were first shut against them Was their exclusion from parliament coeval with973the reformation itself? Did it take place in consequence of any solemn and enlightend revision of the constitution? No, sir; it was the very reverse of this; and my right hon. and learned friend knows, that it was so. It was not till after the lapse of nearly a century and a half from the rupture between Henry the VIIIth, and the pope; it was not till the latter end of the reign of Charles the IId, when serious danger was apprehended to our civil as well as religious liberties from the expected succession of James to the crown; it was not till the ferment excited by the publication of what is called Oates's plot (which every man of sense and learning now knows to have been a most infamous and barbarous forgery) had let loose a noxious spirit which overcame the reason of some of the best and ablest men in the nation; that, in a moment of insane rage and terror, an act was passed to exclude all catholics from parliament, because the commons could not then obtain, what by the revolution they did obtain, the exclusion of a catholic from the throne. Yet even then the measure was not extended to the catholic of Ireland; to those, be it remembered, whose descendants are the actual petitioners now before the house. And why was it not? We have, sir, the most indisputable testimony on this point. It comes from the lord-lieutenant himself, the duke of Ormond, who informed the earl of Arran, that he did not chuse to assemble the parliament of that kingdom, \"chiefly on account of the severity of two bills transmitted against the papists, the one taking away the votes of peers, while they are papists, and the other inflicting death upon a certain sort to the papist clergy if found in Ireland, the one seeming unjust, the other cruel, and neither necessary.\" [Carte's Life of Ormond, Vol. II. p. 535.] And here, sir, suffer me for one minute to fix your attention on this invaluable document under the hand of a witness so much above all exception. In the first place, it establishes the fact, that catholics did then sit in parliament; otherwise how would it have been unjust to deprive them of that which they did not enjoy? And thus it sweeps away at once all the rubbish of violent and illegal resolutions. Which the learned member who addressed you last night, raked together from the journals of the Irish house of commons in times of intestine confusion, which, if those unjustifiable regulations had even been carried into effect (though they do not appear to have been) would have vitiated all their974authority. But, sir, it goes much further. It establishes the more important fact, that the catholics of Ireland, who down to the revolution held seats in both houses of parliament; aye, sir, and high places in the state too, had been found faithful to their trust. The lord-lieutenant, not a stranger sent among strangers, but a man, who during forty years had taken a leading part in the government of that his native land, and who had himself been a conspicuous actor in the suppression of that formidable rebellion and the retaliation of that pretended massacre, which at this distance of time some men affect to consider as an excuse for every mode of legislative persecution; the duke of Ormond, a lord-lieutenant so qualified as I have described him, pronounced \"the severity of the law, which first excluded the catholics from parliament, to be contrary to justice, and warranted by no political necessity.\" Such then was the condition of the catholics in this essential respect at the epoch of the revolution. What then followed? Did the charter of the revolution touch the members of that church in Ireland? It was not till the third year of William, that they were excluded from the parliament of that kingdom; and it is notorious that in measures of penal restriction and prohibition against his catholic subjects, that great and wise prince did not obey his own judgment, but yielded reluctantly to the temper of the times. For his own proper sentiments we must look to his own proper acts. In the articles of Limerick, signed by his favourite general and the lords justices a little before the law which I have mentioned passed here, and in the ratification of those articles by himself, notwithstanding that law, we read the pure dictates of his own policy. He there engages himself to put the catholics, in regard to their religion, on the footing on which they stood in the reign of Charles the IId; and to endeavour, whenever he could summon a parliament in Ireland, to procure new provisions for their greater security. Nor is the sort of relief, which he designed for them, left dubious. There is an express stipulation, that no oath should be administrated to them, save the oath of allegiance alone. Let me not be told that the parliament of England remonstrated against the articles of Limerick; let me not be told that the parliament of Ireland some years after defeated the purpose of them, by superadding the condition of the other oaths, which catholics could not conscien-975ciously take. I know it; perhaps I may grant the abstract right of both parliaments to do what they did: but in them I see the operation of popular prejudices; in the conduct of the glorious champion of the protestant cause, and of the eminent statesman who advised him on these occasions, I see a deliberate system of wise and generous policy.&#x2014; Will will now, sir, with your permission, turn to the other main branch of the argument; it cannot detain us long:&#x2014; I mean, sir, the exclusion of catholics from the principal offices of state. This was early done by the oath of supremacy enacted in the first year of Elizabeth. But do we discover there the slightest vestige of the high and solemn principle, which my right hon. and learned friend supposed to be recognized in it? Is that oath declared to be required, because in our limited monarchy, almost the whole actual authority of the king, and the \"entire responsibility, may be delegated to his ministers?\" Alas! sir, in that statute, justice and mayors ate thought of sufficient importance to be particularized, but not a word is there of the great officers of state: they are huddled among the menial servants of the palace, in the general description of \"persons having the king's fee or wages.\" The oath, however, at its original formation, was consistent with its professed object. It had a positive as well as a negative clause. It directly asserted the supremacy of the king, as well as as a negative clause. It directly asserted the supremacy of the king, as well as as abjured the supremacy of the pope. It was calculated to exclude the protestant as well as the papist dissenter. But at the settlement of the revolution, in the charter, whence my right hon. and learned friend concludes that all these immediate representatives of majesty as well as all the members of every branch of the legislature ought to be if the same religious persuasion with the sovereign on the throne, this very oath was new-modelled in compliance with the wished of the protestant dissenters, to make it a simple renunciation of obedience to the pope.&#x2014;You have already seen, sir, how little importance William the IIId attached to this oath, when in the projected settlement of Ireland on the capitulation of Limerick, he would have exempted his catholic subjects from that test. But Providence has preserved to us a much more perfect and authentic monument of the full scope of his benevolent disposition towards them, than any which has yet been named. It is a paper drawn up from the verbal communications of the king himself, revised976by lord Somers, and approved by the united wisdom of the great statesmen, who were his colleagues. It was prepared with the view of being laid before the congress of ministers from all the principal courts of Europe assembled at Ryswick, and it is worthy of its authors, worthy of the dignity of the occasion for which it was designed, worthy of being had in remembrance and veneration in all time to come, as containing the best, the clearest, the soundest, the most accurate, the most convincing exposition, that ever has been written, of the fundamental principles of our happy revolution. Other parts of it, if I mistake not, I have formerly brought to the notice of the house; but my present business is with that only which relates to the subject of this night's debate. Hear then, sir, the leading maxim, which, in this respect, was the guide of William's counsels. \"The king (says he) has at all times professed, that it was his fixed principle, that men's consciences ought not to be forced in matters of religion; but that these ought to be left to God. He has always acted pursuant to this rule; because he thinks it just in itself, and that it is a wise measure of government.\" Yet all this, it may be said, is no more than general profession. Be it so. Listen then to his sentiments on the very identical case now before you. He had been consulted by the late king concerning the repeal of the laws against the catholics: and what was his answer? He tells us that \"he declared his thoughts very freely. He liked the motion of repealing them, which might have satisfied all those of that communion, as it did the most moderate of them. He did not indeed, think it adviseable to repeal those other laws, that excluded them from sitting in parliament, and from Offices of trust. This proposition, if closed with, would have made the Roman catholic subjects safe and easy;\" and in his estimation, ought to have made their protestant fellow-subjects also safe and easy. [Lord Somers's Tracts, 1st. collection, vol. 1. page 401, &c;] Even with the despotic and bigoted James on the throne, he would have deemed our civil religious liberties sufficiently secured against the catholics by the two principal of the restrictions (for there still are many more) under which they day labour. He would immediately have advanced them to a better condition in society, than that, in which the benignity and justice of his present majesty, and the more en-977lightend and more generous policy of the present times, have at length tardily placed them, after more than a century of oppression, more especially severe in Ireland under a code devised with wicked ability to extinguish and ancient nobility and gentry, to sow discord among all the relations of civil society, to beggar and barbarise the great mass of the population; a code, of which a faint resemblance can only be found in the persecution, which was begun against the Christian religion by its most subtle and dangerous enemy, Julian the Apostate. But would the liberal clemency of William and his ministers have stopped there? No; for he adds, \"if they had behaved themselves so well upon such a favour, as to put an and to the jealousies of the nation,they might after that have pretended to further degrees of confidencewith a better grace.\" To what further degrees of confidence? None would have remained to bestow, but to have admitted them into parliament, and the great offices of state; none, but to have removed what my right hon. and learned friend, considers as strong barriers erected by our ancestors to protect the constitutions, as stupendous monuments of their industry and wisdom never to be broken down, never to be weakened and impaired: yet this would William and his ministers have done. Here then is an irrefragable answer to all the objections drawn from the principles of the revolution. We, who support the motion, have with us the explicit authority of those who planned, who conducted, who settled the revolution: and as my deceased friend once said that he did not wish to be thought a better Whig than lord Somers, so do I now say that I shall never affect to understand the principles of the revolution better than King William, lord Somers, and that band of eminent statesmen his colleagues, whose counsels laid the firm foundation of all which we have since enjoyed of power and glory abroad, or freedom and happiness at home.&#x2014;In truth, all the topics taken from the distinguishing character of our religious establishment, as applicable to the present question, come much too late. This house, the other house of parliament, his majesty, all have long since and in repeated instance, decided against them. A learned member, who last night led the opposition to the motion of my honourable friend, represented the catholics as guilty of a sort of treason, because they refused to take the978old test oaths! But if so, we are accomplices of their treason; for, in compliance with their scruples, we have remodelled those oaths and substituted other, which we consider as satisfactory pledges of their loyalty, expect where we chuse to retain the old oaths in two or three particular cases, not as tests of their allegiance, but as the means of their exclusion. Much to our honour, we gave them the opportunity of publicly disclaiming the principles, dangerous to liberty and civil society, which had been attributed to them so long; and they availed themselves of it. They took, their clergy as well as laity took, the oath which we proposed. We bore fresh testimony to their good conduct by granting new favours, but accompanied by new and more complete tests; which, the house will be satisfied, were not carelessly or ignorantly framed, nor worded with too partial an indulgence to the catholics when I mentioned, that the bill was introduced here by the present lord chancellor of Ireland. They conformed to this additional demand upon them. They did not shrink from these amended and enlarged tests. Whatever we held forth to them on terms which did not touch any point of their religious faith, they have ever cheerfully accepted; and on questions merely spiritual, I am sure, this house will never subscribe to the principle of forcing men's consciences. If then the catholics have satisfied us by every proof, which we have sought to obtain from them with a sincere desire of being satisfied, that they are attached, as we are to the happy constitution of our common country, is not that a powerful argument for giving them a more valuable interest in that constitution? Will you not for that reason think them capable of being admitted sooner of later of the full participation of all the rights and privileges of British subjects? No; says my hon. and learned friend, the attorney-general; never. Too much has been conceded to them already. If that be his opinion, why does he not act upon it? Why does he not move for the repeal of all the measures for relieving the catholics from disabilities, and for the re-enactment of all the restrictive statutes? In consistency he is bound to do so; for the argument he used against the present claims of the catholics, will equally apply in support of a motion for renewing all the former disqualifications. But he is too discreet to make the experiment. He is well aware that the good sense of the house and the country will not go979with him. From the reign of Elizabeth down to the present moment, whatever rigorous measures have from time to time been adopted against the catholics, none of them have been considered as fixed, permanent, immutable, fundamental laws, but as temporary securities against some immediate danger of the crisis either real or supposed. Now a practicable breach is made in all of them. Not one is entire. Some part of each has been taken away; and the last act of liberality, which the catholics on the recommendation of the lord-lieutenant obtained from the parliament of Ireland, acknowledged their general right to every thing; whatever was not actually granted, it with-held only as an exception, from the same supposed motive, which has been the declared ground of every relaxation, that of political expediency alone.&#x2014;My right hon. and learned friend, however, not trusting altogether to his high doctrines of the constitution, endeavours to excite a personal feeling for the situation, in which a compliance with the petition might place his majesty. He tells us, that we should soon witness, what he denominates a solecism in fact as well as in law, a protestant king surrounded by catholic counsellors. I confess I am at a loss to discover the justice or the validity of such an argument. When we unfetter the royal prerogative, does it follow that we force upon his majesty catholics for his ministers and counsellors? Does it follow, that by extending the sphere of his majesty's choice, in the selection of his confidential ministers, or the appointment to places of power and trust, to so numerous a class of our fellow-subjects, we force any description of persons upon the throne? There is another class of dissenters, to which I had supposed that my right hon. and learned friend feels the same objection; I mean the presbyterians. Them, I had imagined, he looks upon as at least equally dangerous with the catholics, if dangerous they be. Now, sir, all the test laws in Ireland. which affected them, have been long since repealed. Yet while that island had an independent parliament and government of her own, how many of the great offices of state were filled by protestant dissenters? The noble lord (lord Castlereagh) whom I see near my right hon. and learned friend, can inform him how few: and if one or two have found the way into his majesty's councils, my right hon. and learned friend, while sitting there, is too polite, whatever I may be, to say that any980mighty mischief has been in consequence sustained. Nevertheless, sir, the first rude shock which the protestant monarchy and church of England had to encounter, came from that description of protestants. My right hon. and learned friend has been pleased to anticipate the entertainment which he and all of us may hereafter receive from an imaginary chapter in the history which is believed to employ the pen of my hon. friend who made this motion; but I am a little surprised that he did not rather point out to our notice an important chapter in every history of England, which he seldom overlooks: I mean the reign of Charles the 1st. In consequence of the sad experience of those times, the test laws, in the beginning of his son's reign, were directly opposed to the protestant dissenters. The catholics had a breathing time. They were considered as inclined to the royal cause. But towards the end of the Long Parliament, jealousies and fears, not unwise, if they had not been carried beyond the bounds of reason and justice, were entertained of the catholics, and the protestant dissenters were zealous and active in the defence of civil and religions liberty. New regulations, therefore, of disabilities and incapacities were introduced to strip the former of the power of doing evil; and the latter, when success had crowned their exertions, were relieved and favoured. From whatever quarter the danger menaced, to that our ancestors turned. And certainly to our mixed constitution there are peculiar and characteristic dangers from each of the opposite description of dissenters. The catholics, from the scheme of their ecclesiastical discipline and their habits of obedience to those who are set over them, incline more to attach themselves to the monarchy; the protestant dissenters from their mode of discipline, and their corresponding habits, are more ready and, strenuous in the maintenance of popular rights and privileges; yet I am sure that they may be equally serviceable, and each upon occasion eminently so, in their proper and well-balanced proportions of political weight and influence in this house, and in the state.&#x2014;An invidious distinction, however, has been taken to the prejudice of the petitioners, because the catholics of this country have not preferred any claims. The situation of the catholics in Ireland is widely different from that of the members of the same communion in this country; and, even if it were not, will it be contended, that if the catholics of981this country should never bring forward any claims, their brethen in Ireland should for ever abandon their equitable rights and just pretensions; or that these, in preferring their claims with moderation and submission to the legislature, should be suspected for improper motives, and charged with extravagance in their demands, because another body of catholics had not come forward with a similar application? Permit me, sir, most earnestly to caution you and the house against giving any sanction to the sort of practical dilemma, in which gentlemen are are too apt to place great bodies of men, for the sake of a turn in debate. Are they silent? Do they leave their case wholly to parliament without petitioning? Oh! then there is the old trite maxim, not to disturb what is quiet. There can be no real grievance, or the sufferers would complain. Do they complain? Do they address us in the natural language of men who feel an injury or an indignity? Oh! then they are disaffected, they are factious, they are seditious, they are traitors; they mean by their numbers to overawe the legislature. Our own honour will not permit us to hear them. Oh! sir, there is nothing which so irritates men, which so embitters a refusal, as this sort of treatment, which leaves them no conduct to pursue with a hope of deserving redress. In the present instance, there are enough to shew, that there is among them a sense of the grievances, which they state, and enough to be objects of our voluntary liberality, always the most gracious; for in public, as in private life,Sweet is the love that comes with willingness.However if my right hon. and learned friend is desirous of having petitions from the catholics of England, let him move to adjourn the debate for that purpose, and I doubt not your table will soon be covered with them.&#x2014;I proceed now to the set of objections, which my right hon. and learned friend, was too well-informed, too candid, and too judicious, to touch upon; I allude what, for the sake of distinction, may he called the polemical objections. These have been left altogether, I think, to the impression made by the speech of the learned member, who first opposed the motion. And here I cannot help first taking notice of what fell from him, in commenting on a passage from a late publication. It is the more necessary to animadvert upon this part of the learned gentleman's speech, because his observations were calculated to cast a reflexion on the character and moral982principles of a very respectable member of the catholic body now living, whom I name to honour, the Rev. Dr. Milner; and the charge of that learned gent. is wholly unwarranted either by the letter or spirit of the passage of the publication upon which he commented.*I perfectly concur in the position there laid down, \"that every human law and every promise or other engagement, however confirmed by oath, must necessarily turn upon the cardinal virtue of prudence, which implies that it depends as to the obligation of fulfilling it, in such and such circumstances, upon the question of expediency:\" but this prudence, in the acceptation of Dr. Milner, and of ethical writers in general, is not a selfish principle which employs itself in weighting interest against duty, but a virtuous principle which weighs one duty with another when they seem to be opposite, and decides which of them, in this place and at this time, is to be fulfilled: a principle not variable with the caprice or interest of a sect, or of the individual, but unchangeably founded upon the eternal basis of truth and justice. The false and wicked deductions drawn by the revolutionary jacobins of France, from the maxim of considering \"the immutable laws of nature and of God as paramount to all subsequent obligations,\" form no argument against the maxim itself; as in fact the conscientious obligation of every human law must rest upon this eternal and immutable law of nature and of God, or it can rest upon no principle at all. Suppose, for instance, in the case of a man having bound himself by oath to deliver a sword or other destructive weapon to his friend, he should, at the moment when he is about to present it,prudently judgethat his friend intends to make a fatal use it, either for his own destruction or that of some other innocent person.&#x2014;[The attorney-general across the table, \"I admit that in such a case an oath would not be obligatory.\"] But I must tell the hon. and learned gent. that this is not a case of my own imagination, but the identical case which Dr. Milner proposed, by way of illustrating his doctrine concerning the prudence to be adopted in considering the obligations of oaths; to*\"The Case of Conscience solved, or Catholic Emancipation proved to be Compatible with the Coronation Oath;\" published about four years since, when the difficulty which is understood to agitate the royal mind was first impressed upon it.983which so much objection has been made. This is the expediency (it is his own word in stating the case) of which Dr. Milner speaks. The misrepresentation, however, does not rest here. There follows in the pamphlet a reference to a passage, where the reverend author before had regularly discussed the whole doctrine of promissory oaths and accurately stated the four cased in which canonists deny their validity. And what are they? Why, when the object of the oath is unlawful:&#x2014;when the object obstructs any good evidently greater:&#x2014;when it is impossible to be obtained:&#x2014;and, lastly, when it relates to some ridiculous idle thing which tends neither to the honour of God nor to the benefit of man. Now, will the learned member dispute the principle of any of these exceptions? If he will, I must forewarn him that he will find himself in opposition to some of the brightest luminaries of our church. For bishop Jewell is not the only one who has written huge volumes on that branch of moral science called casuistry, than which, in my judgement, no part of ethics is more important as none is more delicate, though perhaps he is the best man who, where his own good faith and his own interests are concerned, is least ready to have recourse to distinctions in his own favour, and most ready to allow them in estimating the conduct of others towards himself. At present, however, we are to consider the rules themselves and not the application of them; and the propriety of the general rules on which the exceptions proceed, I do not believe that the learned member himself will controvert. What then ought he not to feel of shame and confusion for the unfounded slander, which he conveyed to the apprehension of a great majority of the house, by a false emphasis laid upon one equivocal word, a marked pause after another of the same kind to fix it more deep in the memory of his bearers, and a suppression of all the most material explanation, which the author cautiously added to preclude the possibility of mistake? What, let me also ask, of displeasure and indignation ought not to be felt against the learned gent. by those, who were betrayed by these unworthy tricks of debate, into acclamations, and cries of assent to the calumny of his misconstruction; and how guarded ought they not to be in future, that they may not again suffer their judgments to be led astray on these subjects by garbled and partial extracts from any pamphlets of works whether. [Mr. Pitt984here nodded a marked assent to the position.] If I do not misinterpret some indications which I perceive, I flatter myself, sir, I have fully succeeded in satisfying the house that the learned gent. took an unfair advantage of their confidence in his character; and that the passage, when considered with the context, means only, what no moralist can deny, that any obligation of a mere human nature, is not binding when contrary to the fixed and immutable laws of God.&#x2014;The learned gentleman, sir, has also used the same measure of candour and impartiality in his quotations from the writings of other living characters, Dr. Troy and Mr. Plowden, whose assertions, in their respective productions concerning the unchangeable nature of their church, apply merely to her doctrine and not to her discipline. In fact, truth, which is the subject of doctrines, is ever immutable; whereas rules for men's conduct in certain situations, which are the subject of discipline, must vary with such situations and circumstances. But he was eager to get, and therefore he little regarded how he got, to his old and favourite topics, the fourth council of Lateran, and the council of Constance. For more than a century, the council of Lateran and the council of Constance have been the hackneyed burthen of the song to all the political and polemical disputants, who have argued with the same passion and prejudice on the same side with the learned member. At the mention of the council of Lateran and the council of Constance, we are expected, it seems, at once to surrender our reason, as to some magical panic. The eternal blazon of the council of Lateran and the council of Constance is to throw us into a paroxysm of poetical terror,To harrow up our souls; freeze our warm blood; Make our two eyes, like stars, stars, start from their spheres, Our knotty and combined locks to part, And each particular hair to stand on end Like quills upon the fretful porcupine;It is to diffuse public and universal dismay;And fright our isle from its propriety.Yet really, Sir, if we could but calmly look around us for one moment, we should discover that we may very quietly pursue our own course as we will, without fear of harm either from the council of Lateran or the council of Constance. With regard to the former it might be sufficient to remark, that it took place some centuries before the reformation; and consequently, that its regulations, which were almost exclusively framed for the discipline of the church in those days cannot afford any authority on a985question, respecting religious differences which had not any existence then, nor till so long a time after that period: two canons only out of seventy (I believe that is the number) contain any point of doctrine, or in other words, any thing which catholics consider as of a fixed and irreformable nature; and in those two there is not a single sentence that to my apprehension involves any position capable of becoming \"dangerous to society and civil liberty;\" not a syllable about deposing kings, or not keeping faith with heretics.&#x2014;However, sir, if upon this slight and distant view, you have a little recovered your natural courage, and can venture to commit yourself to my guidance, we will approach a little nearer, if you please, and endeavour to take a more distinct survey of the features of this hideous goblin. Be assured, we shall find the decent horrors with which the grisly apparition is graced, to be like the battlements of fire, and menacing d&#x00E6;mons, of which we read in romances, that recede and vanish, when you advance upon them with resolution, and sometimes change suddenly to scenes of allurement and delight.&#x2014;The profession of faith, with which the council of Lateran sets out, keeps in view the model of the Nicene creed, though with considerable additions in a style of discrimination perhaps a little too metaphysical for a standard of popular belief. It begins by acknowledging in effect, \"one only God, the Creator of evil as well as of good spirits; the Maker of our bodies as well as our souls; the Giver of the law of Moses, as well as of the law of Christ.\" Surely, so far there is nothing to startle the protestantism even of the learned member himself. It then proceeds to the incarnation, death, burial, resurrection, and ascension, mingling up all with expositions intended, as every part of this creed was intended, to meet the heresies then supposed to prevail; it takes occasion distinctly to assert the doctrine of transubstantion; and, in a parenthesis, declares the Virgin Mary to have been always a virgin. Still, sir, I am persuaded, that, however much there may be in some of these doctrines for our divines to controvert, you will not have perceived any thing, that can serve as an excuse for depriving a single catholic of the meanest civil right. To do so would be to act in that very spirit of persecution, with which the learned gentleman charges the church of Rome. As to the position with which this canon concludes, the house has already pronounced judgement upon it986in the reception which it met, when it was glanced at in the speech of an hon. friend of mine, whose presence among us I have long anxiously desired, Who Was heard last night for the first time within these walls; the character of whose eloquence I shall leave to the impression which it visibly made on his audience; for to praise him with justice would require eloquence like his own; and there are very few men indeed in this house, who are entitled to undertake that task. In myself it would be presumption to attempt it. I can only state more plainly, what he sent out of court with a laugh by a lively allusion. The clause in question, sir, merely defines, that \"sinners may be pardoned, if truly penitent, and married persons, no less than those who are unmarried, may hope to go to Heaven.\" The pope was mere good-natured to human frailty, than were the sectaries called Cathari, or puritans of that day, and in this respect the church of England agrees with the pope. This canon is followed by another, which condemns the opinions of two theological writers, the abbot Joachim of Calabria, and a learned student of the faculty of divinity at Paris whose name can hardly, be collected with certainty, though I believe it was Amaury,*and whose works have so totally perished, that the object of the canon with difficulty from cotemporary historians and annalists. And here, sir, terminates all, for which Dr. Troy and Mr. Plowden, were dragged before this house as witnesses to prove that the doctrines of their church are unchanged and unchangeable. You have heard already, Mr. Speaker, how large a portion of the cannons sanctioned by this council was occupied in points of mere discipline. They are, many of them, standing authorities in our own church; indeed, having been confirmed afterwards in a provincial constitution of Stephen Langton, arch bishop of Canterbury, they are at this moment a part of the law of the land, The learned member, as an ecclesiastical judge (for he is at the head of that jurisdiction in his native country) must be intimately acquainted with them. They enter into the matter of his professional duty, and may be a ground of his judicial decrees almost every day in the*He is called by different authorities Amalricus, Almaricus, and Amorricus: by Dupin, Amaury987week. I cannot therefore but pay a compliment to his dextrous management in concealing the knowledge of them. He appears perfectly to understand his own sort of prudence and expediency. For he was aware that if he had ingenuously informed us what they contained, there would have ended at once all his hopes of working our alarms to his purposes. Had he told us, that they forbade the institution of new orders of friars and nuns, and the veneration of new relics; promoted learning by ordering grammar schools to be every where kept for the instruction of poor scholars out of the revenues of the churches, and protected learning by threatening with punishment all bishops who should ordain ignorant priests; provided for the purity of elections by chapters and other ecclesiastical bodies; discountenanced vexatious appeals from the inferior spiritual courts; prohibited the spiritual judges from encroaching on the temporal jurisdictions, and directed, that no sentence of excommunication should pass, till after admonition in the presence of witnesses, and for a public and reasonable cause: above all, had he suffered it to escape him, that they strictly enjoined the clergy to be always gravely and plainly dressed; not to keep horses and hounds; not to go hunting and hawking; not to play at games of chance; not to frequent theatres or taverns; nor to engage in any secular trade or employment: (Mr. Wilberforce and the attorney-general cried hear! hear!) and finally that the decrees of this council of Lateran are a main support of our canon law of this day against a plurality of benefices; some of the gentlemen who sit near him, and who now will probably vote with him, instead of being scared by this terrible council of Lateran; would have called aloud for it, and have gladly embraced it at the risk of all the brute fulminations against heretics with which it may blaze. It is not my wish however, to dissemble, that there is one canon of great and excessive severity, to which alone all the obloquy which the learned gentleman has levelled at the whole seventy in a mass, is, I believe, intended to apply. But before we can decide upon it, we must see by what authority besides that of the pope, and for what purpose it was made. That council, in consequence of Constantinople being then in the hands of the crusaders, was not only perhaps the largest assembly of prelates and dignitaries of the church that ever met, but was attended by the emperors,988both of the East and the West, as well as by the kings of all the principal kingdoms in Europe, either in person or by their ambassadors. They consented to the proceedings; they alone gave validity to them, wherever there was a question of temporal penalties and forfeitures; and so it was understood even in that age. It did not concern them to maintain in his possessions a great feudatory lord, who resisted their opinions by force of arms; but they took care that the rights of the superior, that is, their own rights, should be saved entire. Certainly the popes did on various occasions assume a power of excommunicating and deposing princes; but it was always regarded by many of the most rigid catholics as an evident usurpation of temporal authority; and it has no foundation in the fourth council of Lateran. The emperors and independent princes who assisted at that council were too wise to establish such a dominion against and over themselves, though some of them individually might have recourse to the pope for their own purposes, as one of them our own king, John, is reported to have offered to turn Mahometan, if he could have procured the aid of an army of Moors from Spain. Against whom too was this canon pointed? Against the Albigenses, whose tenets have been the subject of much controversy since the reformation. Their pastors and leaders (it is proved to my conviction at least) held tenets not very remote from our own. Yet with them undoubtedly were mingled many hot-headed and sour-tempered fanatics of furious and impracticable zeal, and a number of Manichees, who having been formerly driven from the East by the Greek emperors, had taken refuge in that country, which had long been, in a great measure, independent of the Roman See. All were confounded together, and the latter in all probability not unwillingly, by their common adversaries: just as in our own country, the sober-minded and reasoning disciples of Wickliff, though innocent, were involved in the merited censure of John Ball, who on Blackheath, by his seditious and atrocious preaching, incited the insurgents of Kent to the murder of every man of rank and eminence in church or state: just as in later times the anabaptists of Germany might have cast a stain on the whole protestant cause, had not Luther himself been active in rousing the neighbouring princes and cities to draw the sword against them not as bad Christians, but as989rebels, unsafe neighbours, enemies of all civil society, and disturbers of the public peace. Council after council for more than half a century had thundered against the Albigenses, always attributing to them the errors of the Manichees. Excommunications, fines, and confiscations had been denounced against them. But they were protected by a powerful confederacy of the barons, earls, and princes of the South of France and the neighbouring kingdom of Arragon. They maintained public conferences and disputations with the prelates of the Roman church; as usual, each party retired with increased animosity and embittered disgust. Civil wars ensued. A crusade was preached against them. The country was desolated with mutual slaughter. Upon one side the king of Arragon was killed; upon the other the count of Montford, general of the crusaders, fell in battle. Raymond, count of Thoulouse, the great patron and defender of the Albigenses had been forced to submit, had broken again with the pope, and in spite of his gallant struggles been stripped of his dominions. Massacres produced a desire of revenge, and retaliation gave birth to cruelties which no provocation could justify or palliate. The worst passions of human nature were let loose on both sides. In this state of long continued irritation it was that the violent measure, which it seems, is never to be forgotten or forgiven, was sanctioned by the fourth council of Lateran. Yet even then, at that very council, Raymond obtained a provision for himself and his family out of his lands. But the question is not at present, and in this place, whether this canon was too severe, still less whether it was or was not altogether unjust; it is merely, whether it contains a solemn, deliberate, systematic principle, which catholics respect as a standing and obligatory rule of conduct, or rather, whether it is so evidently such, that we cannot believe them, when they disclaim and abjure it. Sir, it is almost ridiculous to state this; for, never did any measure carry on the surface of it so plainly the form and pressure of the times. And what have we, six hundred years after, to do with Raymond, count of Thoulouse, who, by the way, subsequently recovered his territories at the point of the sword and left them to his son?&#x2014;Yet, sir, called as this council was for the settlement of Europe as well as the regulation of the church, there vas one subject agitated in it, which might have been thought more interesting to an English990house of commons than any connected with the affairs of Raymond, count of Thoulouse; and this, Mr. Speaker, was nothing less than the validity of the GREAT CHARTER. In that same year had this first and most important fundamental law of our rights and liberties been extorted from the reluctant hand of John by the great barons leagued together for this purpose, and guided to this object by the temperate, but firm counsels of Stephen Langton, archbishop of Canterbury; for to that excellent prelate do we principally owe this corner-stone of our free constitution. He it was, who observing, that the tumultous contentions which were perpetually breaking out between the usurpation of an ill-defined monarchy on the one side, and the irregular pretensions of a high-minded aristocracy on the other, only led to alternations of anarchy and tyranny, equally lawless and destructive, conceived and proposed to the confederate lords the project of fixing with precision for ever in a solemn instrument, the franchises, privileges, and immunities of all the estates of the people of the realm. But the wax of his seal was hardly cold, when the perfidious and unprincipled king sent to implore the interposition of the pope, to release him from the obligation of fulfilling his duty, and preserving his faith to his subjects. Innocent the IIId, to whom John had before surrendered his kingdom, issued his bull, declaring the charter void, as derogatory to his rights in his new character of lord paramount. He appointed legates to publish it here. But the primate, though he had been elevated to the see of Canterbury immediately by the pontiff himself, held on his own course in a matter which, he was conscious, no way belonged to the papal tribunal. He encouraged the barons to resist. For this he was himself suspended from the exercise of his functions by the legates. He was formally accused before the council of Lateran. He scorned to deny the charge: the suspension was confirmed; the archbishop of. Canterbury suspended, and the barons of the realm excommunicated by the council of Lateran for having obtained the GREAT CHARTER! and yet, sir, I perceive no cry, no look, no gesture of consternation around me. Not a man among us appears to think the GREAT CHARTER in one title less secure for the violent attempt made to crush it at the council of Lateran. Not a man, I Will venture to say, will suggest to his majesty, that his imperial crown is in the slightest danger991from the claims of the pope, derived from Innocent the IIId as lord paramount. Why then, in the name of common sense, should we trouble ourselves about the severe measures pursued, the excommunications and loss of possessions denounced against Raymond, count of Toulouse his confederates, and subjects? But there is one striking lesson to be collect from the passage of our history which I have just related. We have there a most illustrious example, that a catholic clergy can distinguish their civil from their religious duties, and be among the foremost to defend the liberties of their country from papal ambition and usurpation. Permit me also to remark, sir, if it to do not seem too, researched, that we find there signal instance of the beneficent care of Providence in converting what was designed for destruction, into the means of safety and support. That very council, which aimed to annihilate for ever the rising liberties of this country, did incidentally contribute much to consolidate their strongest bulwark, the TRIAL BY JURY. One of its canons strictly enjoined the priests to refuse the aid of their ministry, which was indispensably necessary, to the absurd and superstitious trials by fire and water: and the removal of these barbarous usages made way for the establishment of the trial by jury, one of the most important provisions of the GREAT CHARTER.&#x2014;And now, sir, as I trust all our public fears of mischief from this gunpowder council of Lateran are pretty well over by this time, I shall employ one or two sentences in offering a little private consolation to the learned member. The council in condemning the opinions of abbot Joachim, declared him to be a good sort of a well-meaning man, though a little wrong-headed, and as the ecclesiastical body over which he had presided, conducted themselves unexceptionably, no disturbance was to be given to them. So, if the petitioners Should succeed; if they should return a hundred members to this house, as the learned gentleman anticipates; and by these hundred members carry all things before them; as he apprehends; they will, I hope remember mercy in that day a their triumph, and pass no harsher judgment on and on the profession, of which now the head. Yet if they should go the uncharitable length the censure on poor Amaury, I doubt not that the learned gentleman bear it with patience and chearfulness in so good a cause even though another general council992of Lateran should say, as the former said;&#x2014;\"the father of lies has so confounded his understanding, that his errors have more absurdity than heresy in them.\" During the two following centuries there were councils in plenty; but the learned member can find none to his taste, till at the end of that interval he comes to that which assembled at Constance. But in What copy of their proceedings does he read the execrable doctrine alleged, that it is lawful to break faith with heretics? oh! he deduces it from the condemnation of Huss, notwithstanding that he had come with a safe-conduct. But from whom? From the council? No; but from the emperor Sigismund, who, as they thought, (and as far as I understand the constitution of those councils, I do think with them) had no right or authority to bind them or prejudice their jurisdiction. And there is, in corroboration of this, a pretty strong fact which the learned gentleman could undoubtedly have told us if he would, The very pope who convened the council of Constance, and who was afterwards deposed by it, though furnished, by the same emperor Sigismund, with a passport of the same tenor with that in the possession of John Huss, nevertheless thought it necessary to have recourse to flight for the security of his person when he stood in the character of an impeached man; being conscious that it could not avail him in case of conviction notwithstandining that the crimes of which he was accused were very different from that of heresy. What, however, will you say, sir, if I assert that the council actually did, though indirectly, decree faith to be kept, instead of broken, with heretics? Indeed I so understand them. For they declare the person*who has engaged his faith, to be only acquitted of the obligation,when he has done all that depended upon himself.The council of Basil and the council of Trent; If examined, would turn out as unfavourable to the learned member, as the council of Lateran or the council of Constance; but since he has only named them as confirming the council of Lateran, I shall pass them over in silence. I have been induced to advert particularly to these points in the hon. and learned member's speech, because from the nature of my professional pursuits, I*The words are&#x2014;nec sic promittentem,cum fecerit quod in ipso est, ex hoc in aliquot esseobligatum.993had occasion to attend to such subjects particularly, and because it is not likely that gentlemen should be familiar with them. I have done so for the purpose of exposing to the house the line of argument that has been pursued and so much dwelt upon; and also as a warning to gentlemen in future, to be cautions how they deal thus partially in abstruse learning with the hope of escaping detection; or quote scraps of pamphlets for the purpose of making them the grounds of unfounded charges against bodies or individuals. But, sir quitting those remote ages, let us come down to our times, and recollect that we are not legislating for catholics in the twelfth or fifteenth centuries, whatever might have been their opinions in those times, but for catholics in the present day; and therefore let us judge of them as they really are. Have they not pledged themselves to their loyalty and attachment to your government and constitution, by every test the legislature has proposed to them; by every solemn assertion that can bind the veracity of man? Have they not as solemnly disclaimed and abjured all those abominable and unsocial principles so repeatedly charged against them, in spite of their oaths and protestations? Have we not virtually acquitted them of those odious charges, by all the successive acts that have passed for their relief; and formally pronounced that acquittal in the preambles to some of those acts&#x2014;and especially in. that of the Irish act of 1793?. Have we not the experience of the good and beneficial effects of the measures hitherto adopted for the relief of the catholics from the disabilities under which they laboured, to guide our judgment on this great question? Have not the catholics proved by their loyalty and good conduct, that they justly merited the alleviations they received; and shall we be told, that their conduct will or can be different, if you remove every remaining disqualification, and make them participators in all the blessings of the constitution? The position is monstrous, and as such I trust will meet no countenance from this house. But, sir, if it be possible that anyl rational doubt can still remain upon the sincerity of the catholics in the solemn tests they have given of their principles, in direct opposition to the unfounded charges against them, upon the pretended authority of ancient councils: if any man can still suppose they hold the monstrous doctrines, that no faith is to be kept with heretics, or persons of a994different persuasion; or that the pope may absolve catholic subjects from their allegiance to protestant princes&#x2014;I can refer to the authority of councils too, that are infinitely better authority on these points than any arguments, assertions, or garbled quotations, that have been urged in the course of this debate, to maintain that the principles of the catholics bely their oaths; or that in taking those oaths they have exaggerated all their other crimes by the addition of perjury. I can refer, sir, to the answers given by the first catholic universities in Europe on these points, to the queries put in 1789, at the particular instance of a right hon. gent. on that side of the house, then and now at the head of his majesty's councils. I mean, sir, the universities of the Sorbonne at Paris, and those of Louvaine, Douay, Salamanea, and Valladolid, some of which express the highest astonishment that such opinions should in this enlightened age and country be conceived to be maintained by the catholic church, and all which deny in the most solemn manner that any such opinions ever were at any time, ancient or modern, any part of the principles of that church.&#x2014;In the course which I have taken, you, Mr. Speaker, and the house will have observed, that I have confined myself to those objections alone, which, in the language of my right hon. and learned friend, are paramount to all the inferior circumstances of accident and locality; and I have endeavoured to demonstrate fully (it may be thought, I fear, too fully) that in the first place, there is nothing in the principles of the constitution, as modified by the reformation or as settled at the revolution, which is incompatible with the unrestrained admission of the catholics to every civil right enjoyed by their protestant fellow-subjects; and that, secondly, there is no foundation for imputing to their religion any that, secondly, there is no foundation for imputing to their religion any principle dangerous to civil society. If in these points I have sufficiently effected, what I proposed to myself, I have done all that appears to me necessary to the support of the present motion. For the question is not now, whether we shall grant the prayer of the petition in its full extent or indeed in any extent, but whether we shall discuss with the freedom only to be had in a committee, the expediency of granting the whole or any, or at the present moment, no part of the desired relief, on a detailed view, of the principles recognised in the several acts formerly passed both by the British and Irish parliaments995in favour of the catholics, of their adversaries, of the actual juncture of our affairs, and in short of all the considerations, by which political action is usually influenced and determined. All who think that any thing should be granted, and even all, who merely on motives of present expediency think that although nothing should be for ever denied, nothing should be now granted, ought to agree in going into a committee for the sake of that discussion; they only can consistently vote against the motion of my hon. friend, who are fixed and resolute to oppose now and for ever against the wishes, affections, and loyalty of their catholic fellow-subjects an impassable bar, an eternal system of exclusion, an irreversible decree of political excommunication and interdict, on account of religion alone; and against the catholics of Ireland in particular, to draw a line of everlasting separation in the outset of that union, which they had been among the most zealous to accomplish, and from which they were encouraged to entertain facther hopes and expectations. When we go into that committee, sir, as I trust we shall, let it be recollected always, that the burthen of proof lies upon those who have to maintain, what stands upon the statute-book itself as a declared exception to a general principle, and is moreover an exception, which, as I believe myself to have shewn, no way corresponds with, but actually extends beyond or falls short of, every principle attempted to be deduced from the letter or spirit of any fundamental law of our constitution. In the main branch of the argument too, they will have to prove the position, the absurdity of which was pointed out in the opening speech of the hon. mover, with his peculiar force, and felicity of rhetorical ridicule; &#x2014;that because, when the king was suspected of being a catholic and of having formed a design in connexion with catholics to overturn the constitution of the country, it may have been a wise precaution to remove all of that persuasion from situations which would have enabled them to assist him; therefore, when the king is a protestant and liable to no suspicion, he is to be precluded from having the services of his catholic subjects. When this is attempted, I shall listen with becoming attention; but hitherto no man has been hardy enough to undertake it. Let me further counsel the hon. and learned member, who last night ran over an historical catalogue of rebel-996lions, assumed that they all arose out of the catholic religion, to come a little better prepared on that subject to the committee, which will be the proper place for those details. For, if he chooses to go back to that of the earl of Desmond in 1576, I warn him that I shall bring no less a witness than Elisabeth. herself, who with expressions of deep sorrow and contrition confessed, that she was in fault, for having committed her flock to the care of wolves, instead of shepherds. Will he select that of the earl of Tyrone towards the end of the same reign? Camden, the co-temporary historian of that reign shall answer him, that it had its origin in private animosities and ambition; and the lord deputy Mountjoy himself shall inform him, that it was continued, because some of the protestant gentlemen had acquired a relish for plunder and free quarters in preference to a quiet harvest; and the catholics, all over the kingdom, feared a persecution for religion, not to mention various other grievances, \"the least of which alone,\" he justly observes, \"have been many times sufficient motives to drive the best and most quiet states into sudden confusion.\"*Beaten out of these, will he have recourse to his favourite massacre of 1641? I will there undertake to show by irrefragible evidence that, although there was much more than enough of cruelty and wanton slaughter on both sides, yet there was no preconceived, preconcerted massacre in the breaking out of that civil war, as is weakly or wickedly asserted. In the meantime, I shall only give the learned gent. notice of one of my witnesses, the royal martyr himself, who will tell him, wise men believed that rebellion to have been kindled \"by preposterous rigour, and unseasonable severity, despair being added to the former discontents, and the fears of utter extirpation to the former oppressions of the country.\" From the same authority also he may learn that \"the rebels were exasperated to the most desperate resolutions and actions,\" by the avowed:menaces of 'over-zealous protestants, who threatened, \"to destroy root and branch, men, women, and children, without, any regard to those usual pleas for mercy, which conquerors, not wholly barbarous, are wont to hear from their own breasts \" but there is a kind of zeal, as Charles subsequently remarks, which*Letter to the lords of the council in England, 1602.997would \"rather be counted cruel than cold, and is not seldom more greedy to kill the bear for his, skin than for any harm he hath done; the confiscation of men's estates being more beneficial, than the charity of saving their lives or reforming their errors.\" The zeal of the learned member and of others, like him, I do not suspect of being exactly of that description. The catholics of Ireland have been ground down to poverty; under the system of relaxation and relief they have not yet accumulated enough individually, to be tempting objects of confiscation; but, when I find the distinction of political power so studiously taken, as that in which the catholics are never to participate, I do rather suspect, that the zeal, which blazes so furiously, is a little inflamed with a desire of monopolizing that political power, and the profits and emoluments, which follow in its train.&#x2014;On the subject of the civil war that grew out of the revolution, the capitulation of Limerick which I have already quoted will he sufficient; if not, I conjure all good Orangemen in the interval to read and digest as they can, the previous declarations of William and his generals, and the complaints which some of them contain of the disorders and robberies committed by their own soldiers. But then comes last, and I am happy to say, least, the recent rebellion. And we shall not have to go far in search of evidence. The striking fact, which was noticed by my hon. friend who rose after the learned member last night, must be decisive to all who are acquainted with the political topography of Ireland. The secret committee of the Irish house of commons reported, but a short time before the rebellion burst forth, that the five northern counties only were organised, as it was called, and those very counties are the smallest number of catholics, and the greatest number of protestants in Ireland; they used to be regarded as the strong holds of the protestant ascendancy. However, if living witnesses should be demanded, I must, in addition to what the learned gent. so elegantly and decently denominated the whole republican, jacobinical, and frenchified faction, call to the bar all his majesty's present and late ministers whom I have heard during their separation and since their coalition, those who are favourable and those who are inimical to the proposed measure, concur in declaring that rebellion not to have been in its essential character a catholic rebellion. &#x2014;With these impressions of the whole sub-998ject befere you, few words, sir, will amply convey the result of my sentiments. I am in general a friend rather to the gradual than to the sudden admission of great bodies of men to political rights from they have been long restricted, and that for the sake of themselves as well as of the community, yet so much has been already conceded, and in a manner so totally unlikely to obtain the good effects of concession, so little remains to give, and the position, in which we are called upon to make a stand, is in itself, so perfectly untenable; that I shall be ready at once to go the whole length of the petition; with what checks and guards, if any shall appear to be necessary, it will be proper to consider in the committee. But above all things, I am most anxious that we should take some step, however inconsiderable may be our progress, that our catholic fellow-subjects may be cheered and animated by the hope of Continuing to acquire more, if they deserve more, till they shall ultimately attain to the full enjoyment, which they pray, of all the benefits of the British constitution. In this momentous crisis of the empire, surely the wisdom of the house will not refuse to stimulate their most active and ardent cooperation in the common cause gratitude and hope, two of the most powerful incentives to good minds; though I am contented to rely on gratitude alone. Indeed if we proceed more minutely to examine the several points of which the petitioners complain, I am confident, that some of them (two especially to which My hon. friend alluded peculiarly oppressive, that this house will never agree to their perpetuation. When I recollect, sir, that two hundred thousand brave Irish catholics defend our empire, and aid in the extension of its power and glory, by sea and land, and who, nevertheless, are the only description of his majesty's subjects that are not now free to serve God according to the dictates of their own consciences; may, who are constrained by the dread of corporal punishment to practise another kind of Worship repugnant to their opinions and their habits,&#x2014;surely there is no serious Christian of the present age who will approve the existence of such religious intolerance, nor any wise politician who will wish for the continuance of so pregnant a source of discontent in our navies and armies. The catholics of this country, too, labour Under grievances extremely oppressive, in consequence of their999religious opinions on one hand, and the state of the laws on the other with respect to the important article of marriage this, in their system, is an awful sacrament, which with peculiar ceremonies, and by the ministers of their own religion. On the other hand, the marriage act does not recognize the legal validity of marriages so performed, however willing and desirous the catholics are to enter into the spirit of that act, by observing all the conditions that have been or may be enjoined to give due publicity to them, or however in fact they may actually observe them. This they must feel in a more sensible manner, in as much as there is an express clause in the marriage act, for exempting Jews and Quakers, who have peculiar ceremonies of their own, from its operation. The mischief, however, of this state of things, it is obvious, does not rest with the catholics, but is a matter of high concern to the general cause of morality; in a word, it constantly occasions much private misery, and frequently much public scandal. On these grounds, sir, I shall most conscientiously vote for the motion of my hon. friend, and I trust that the decision of the house will be such as will be worthy of its liberality, and honourable to the character of the parliament and of this country.", "author_id": "/people/mr-french-laurence", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

His lordship did not well know whether he should dwell upon the regulation as a standing order of the house, or merely as an admonition or remembrance, in which light it seemed to be considered by the noble lord on the woolsack.

He had therefore to represent the abuse of such an order as pregnant with the most pernicious consequences. It was not only incompatible with the dignity of the house, and the impartiality and solemnity of their proceedings, but it also went to infringe the privileges of the house, by rendering nugatory the interposition, in the case of such committees, of proxies or614protests.

{"date": ["1805", "may", "14"], "content": "rose and spoken in substance as follows: Sir, I consider the question now before the house, as one naturally and immediately the consequence of the legislative union established between Great Britain and Ireland, and one to which the catholics of Ireland were certainly taught to look for-1023ward in the course of all the arguments urged in favour of that measure, both in and out of parliament. I think, and have long thought, it is that measure by which alone the great union of protestant and catholic can be brought about. When the proposition for the union was first brought forward, I had strong objection to the measure; and I was only reconciled to it upon the idea that all disabilities attaching on the catholics were to be removed, and that the whole population would be united in interests and affections. Believing this to be the case, sir, and finding that impediments were started to this measure much stronger than I was prepared to apprehend, I relinquished the administration, because I thought the measure indispensable to the safety of this empire; and I have seen nothing since to change my opinion on that point. The right hon. gent. has avowed that his opinion was then the same; and surely if it was expedient in 1801; if the circumstances of the country then imperiously called for its adoption; surely it is still loudly called for by the circumstances of the present moment; and I know of no alteration that has taken place in the circumstances of the empire that can be truly said to render it less expedient now. The right hon. gent., in every thing which he has offered as argument against the question itself, has referred to times past, but how those arguments can apply to the present day he has not stated. The right hon. gent. has that many persons are averse to the measure, that the clergy and the nobility are opposed to it, and that the public mind is not unanimous in its favour. Why, sir, if the catholics are to be told they must wait until all the objections which passion, or prejudice, or ignorance, or caprice may suggest, are perfectly silent; and that no man is to be found in or out of parliament opposed to their wishes, I am afraid their hopes of success must be postponed to a very distant day indeed: but, sir, I am not aware of this very general sentiment of the leading clergy, the nobility, or the public at large, against this measure, unless we take the speeches uttered in this or another house of parliament, opposed by other speeches, at least equally strong and independent, for that general sentiment; or unless we consider the declarations of the kingdom, or a few newspaper publications from prejudiced authors, as expressive of that general sentiment. But if arguments drawn from such sources are1024insisted on; if no measure is every to pass in parliament which has not the unanimous sense of the country in its favour, prejudice and passion may for every triumph over reasoning sound policy. But, sir, as long as a catholic remains in these countries, such objections will exist. They are founded upon the very essence of opinions, which you can never remove from those minds, on the very first principles of which they are rooted. And so long as they exist, there never will be wanting an outcry against the claims of the catholics. I should be glad to know what public question that ever came forward in this house has had in its favour such unanimity, that there could be no objection to it? While we have to encounter prejudice and oppose confederacy, how is it possible that truth and reason can be victorious with unanimity? But to say that this house is to be deterred by popular clamour or prejudiced objections from exercising its fair judgment, is tantamount to a declaration that no disorders can be removed, no abuses corrected, no tyranny subdued. I therefore must resist and deprecate such arguments coming from the righ hon. gent. against this motion, as unparliamentary, unconstitutional, and dangerous. But, sir, I know of no reason why that measure which his majesty's minister is of opinion was expedient, and ought to have been done four years ago, and may be done hereafter, ought not to be done now: and as to any danger that can arise from bringing forward the question now, as is alledged without the chance of success, the only mischief I can apprehend is from the refusal, which must recoil upon ministers themselves, as the cause of it. The whole of the right hon. member's speech upon this this subject is indefinite, full of mystery, and, to me at least, not clearly intelligible. The right hon. gent. has talked of expediency as distinct from right. But the claim of the catholics if not set up upon what is termed a fantastical claim of right, but a plain and common right to an equal share and participation in the benefits of the constitution under which they live. I am myself disposed to rest the principle part of the claim upon expediency, without excluding right. But the right hon. gent. will bear only of expediency. But this sort of attack upon priciples of right cannot be maintained. Rights, in the strictest sense of the word, as employed by the right hon. gent. no where exist but even on the ground of right as a claim of nature, the catholic petition, I say, is founded in justice. They state that what1025they ask is founded on political expediency; and the policy and expediency of acceding to their petition, is only rebutted by alleging, that to grant their claims would be attended with the greatest danger to our protestant establishments in church and state. What this danger is, from the best consideration I have been able to give to the subject, I am utterly at a loss to discover; the onus of proof lies upon those who plead that danger. But, looking to all the dangers; as well these which those who oppose this motion plead, as those which there may be any reasonable ground to apprehend, I think that to grant now the claims of the catholics is by much the less dangerous policy to pursue. For the present, however, I shall not trespass on the attention of the house by arguing the question further; I shall content myself with entering my solemn protest against the species of argument urged by his majesty's ministers against this petition, and declaring my firm resolution to persevere in this object, which I consider as best calculated for the safety of that very protestant establishment to which it is said to be inimical; and I have the strongest hope, anxiety, and confidence, that the period is not far remote when this house will see the justice and sound policy of conceding this salutary, wise, and beneficent measure.", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-windham-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

The nation, sir, was Hungary; of her seven millions of inhabitants one half were protestants, Cal-1026vinists, and Lutherans; many of the Greek church, and many Jews. Often had even Mahomet been called in to the aid of Calvin, and the crescent glittered on the walls of Buda. At length, in 1791, at the most violent crisis of disturbance, a diet was called, and passed a decree, by which they secured the fullest and freest exercise of religious faith, worship and education; ordained that churches and chapels should be built for all sects without description; that the protestants of both confessions should depend on their own spiritual superiors alone, freed from swearing by the usual oaths, namely&#x2014;\"by the holy virgin Mary, the saints, and chosen of God.\" And then, sir, came the great and leading clause, granting, in the fullest extent, every point which is in the utmost contemplation of the present petitioners to this house:&#x2014;\"The public offices and honours, whether,high or low, great, or small, shall, be given to natural-born Hungarians, who have deserved well of their country, and posseses the other requisite qualifications, without any respect to their religion.\" This, sir, was the policy pursued in an Hungarian diet, consisting of nearly 400 members, in a state whose form of government approaches more nearly, to our own than almost any other in Europe, with a Roman catholic establishment of great opulence; adopted, too, at a period when it was to be subjected to the severest trial as to its social and political effects. It has passed that fiery ordeal: it has undergone a trial of fourteen revolutionary years, equal, in fact, to the trial of a century less disturbed and agitated: and what have been its effects? When the French advanced in their course like a torrent, within a few days march of Vienna, the Hungarians, before so divided, and so disaffected to each other, rose en masse, as it is termed, \"in the sacred insurrection,\" to preserve their sovereign, their rights and liberties: and the apprehension of their approach dictated to the reluctant Buonapart&#x00E9; the immediate signature of the treaty of Leoben. Such, sir, have been the effects of such a measure in Hungary. The Romish hierarchy in Hungary exist in all its former splendour and opulence. Never has an attempt been made diminish it: and there, almost alone in civilized Europe, at least in that quarter of it, have revolutionary principles failed of making the smallest successful inroad. Does this case, or does it not, as I have stated, bear directly on the case of the catholics of Iresand? Has a1027Roman catholic potentate, not the least attached to his religion in Europe, set you such an example, and given you decided proof of its great and happy effects, by such a trial? And do you, a protestant legislature, fear to submit your religion to a similar test? Will you eternally keep up the wall of proscription, when they have thrown it down? This, sir, affords a direct refutation of the assertion made in the petition from the city of Dublin, (see p. 218) which states that the Roman catholics are at present placed upon a footing of political power not enjoyed by any other dissenters from the established religion in any other state of Europe. Convinced as I am, sir, of the wisdom and sound policy of acceding to this petition, I shall give my most cordial assent to the motion of the hon. member who so ably introduced this debate.", "author_id": "/people/sir-simon-newport", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

He never would affront their feelings, which he neither wished nor was1028able to do. He said he should not be glad to have the ability to do it, and he should be ashamed to have the wish: but, it was with regret that he adverted to the opinion of a learned gentleman, opposite (Mr. Ponsonby) who, in answer to, what he Called the calumnies of the hon. and learned doctor's speech yesterday, had said that the hon. doctor himself was a contradiction of those calumnies; that they could not be true, and that the Irish were not of the sanguinary temper which had been misrepresented, was proved by the hon. and learned doctor's walking the streets of this metropolis in safety. He said he would not call such an opinion as this a hint, for it was in truth, very broadly expressed, nor was it necessary to notice it, farther than by saying, it reminded him of a familiar and ludicrous story of the quaker and the mad dog.\"I will not beat thee nor kick thee, but I will turn thee out and give thee an ill name.\" He was sure, however, that the learned doctor would still continue to walk the streets in safety. He said, he could not agree with, the hon. gent. who introduced the petition; and who had represented the Catholics; as having given support to the union, and as having for that reason a right to claim the object of their petition. He said, on whatever ground their claims might be founded, they could not be founded on that, for it was well known the support they gave the union was a very poor one. He would tell the house what it was It would appear in three instances, which he would mention without any remark:first, however, wishing the house to recollect, that the public affairs of the catholics had been used for many years to be conducted by a select committee, consisting of gentlemen the most distinguished in the catholic body for their property, principles and talents, and in number about sixty, Of these the late lord Kenmare was at the head. A most amiable and respectable nobleman. Who was at the head of it know, He said, when the union was first proposed to the house of commons of Ireland, it was scarcely considered enough to be debated; it was defeated; for,though it was indeed carried through the house by the accidental majority of a single voice, this was defeat sufficient to induce the prudence of government to postpone it to the next session of parliament. On this occasion how did the catholics act? It was an occasion so important that they could not have been indifferent to it, and must have had an opinion one way or the other; but they kept aloof1029and kept silence, which might be interpreted either way; they said nothing, and they did nothing,and this was the first instance of such support as they gave to the union. The union, however, was still going on; but while it was uncertain which way it would go, the catholics at last broke through their silence, and one of their select committee came with a message to some of the gentlemen who conducted the opposition to the union, which Message in substance, and he believed in words, was this, \"if you, gentlemen, will now join us in insisting on our emancipation, we will join you in opposing the union.\" Those gentlemen thought it best to decline this overture, and this is the second Instance of the support which the catholics gave to the union. But the next session of parliament was now approaching, and this great measure of the union had now been so much considered, that addresses in its favour came from every county in the kingdom. Among the signatures of the protestants to these addresses, appeared the signatures of Many catholics; catholic noble-Men, and catholic clergy, and some catholic individuals sent addresses from themselves. But, was there any address in favour of this measure from the catholic body? No! Was there any address from the select committee? No! Was there any summons, notice, or advertisement for any public meeting under any denomination, where the influence of respectable catholics, individually or collectively, might have been of use in promoting the union passed into a law in parliament, and this was the third and the last instance of that support which is boasted to have been given by the catholics to the union. How far, on this ground, their claims could be entitled to success, he would leave the house to judge&#x2014; He said, there were other grounds, on which at another time, those claims might appear more probable to succeed: for, recollecting the concessions which were made to them in the year 1793, and at the express recommendation of government, in which he had concurred with many gentleman then present; recollecting that they had pledged themselves in an address almost unanimous to the crown, that they would consider on such measures as should tend to unite in sentiment all descriptions of his majesty's subjects; recollecting, that to carry this purpose into effect, how much there was still to do, he thought the catholics had good cause to expect that more would be done. He said it might be wise to make1030concession gradual; because, all which is right, cannot always be done at once. He said, the embarrassment of the question was not what more was to be done, but that at present we could do nothing; that in this point of view, the catholics had a good cause badly conducted. A cause which the protestants had contributed to make good, and which the catholics had conducted badly. By this he did not mean that the catholics were bad subjects, for he believed them to be loyal; nor that they were bad men, for he believed them as good as the protestants; nor that this was as bad petition, for it was very well and respectfully worded; nor yet that their cause was badly conducted by being placed in the hands of the honourable gentleman opposite. He said, that when the catholics were once determined to apply to that house at that time, which was all the badness of conduct which he meant to mention, and when the king's minister had declined to interfere, there certainly was no interference more powerful or proper for their purpose than that which they had solicited from the hon. gentleman, who, he said, was so much distinguished every where as a friend to religious and civil liberty, whose temper invited confidence and good will from every body to respect him. What he thought bad in conducting this petition was, that it should be introduced at this time by any interference or from any motive; he thought it bad to risk the importance of the precedent, for though in such a case the precedent could not be repeated often enough to become a habit, still it was bad to familiarize the people of England to the circumstance of the house of commons putting a negative on any request from the catholic body of Ireland. He said, it was still worse to risk the importance, or it gentlemen chose, of the catholic body was exhibited in the house of commons, as the ally of a party. He said that the parties in the house of commons were fit only to contend with each other, that the catholic body should look to neither of them, and neither of them should look to the catholic body. The hon. gent. said, that for such reasons as these, and for others which might be mentioned, without entering into a religious or political disquisition of the question, he should concur with the right hon. gent. on the floor in declining to refer it to a committee.", "author_id": "/people/mr-richard-archdall", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

Intimately connected as I am with the prosperity of my native land, it must be expected that upon any question connected therewith, I shall give a sincere vote. Those who know me will believe that I shall do so this night, in honest accordance with my conscience, my judgment, and what I conceive to. be the Sense of my constituents. In Common cases, profession of principles and independence would only appear superfluous; but, where prejudices are to be combated,and popularity is perhaps divided, I feel it not unnecessary to assert my complete independence, alike of ministerial influence and of popular clamour, should the one be supposed adverse,or the other favourable. to the prayer of the petition.&#x2014; Having thus far trespassed on the house to disclaim, in my vote, all sinister influence, I now beg its indulgence to a few reasons,1032which I shall briefly and plainly advance in support of that vote.&#x2014;It is impossible that I, in common with every member of this house, must not feel affected by the torrent of eloquence Poured forth by the hon. mover and supporters of the motion; but I have not been convinced; and while I admired, I was awakened to a sense of the necessity of recurring to those obligations which I accepted with the great and honourable trust reposed in me by my constituents; and their sentiments on the subject now before us have been too recently and too strongly expressed in the petition on your table, for me to affect to misunderstand,or with propriety oppose: neither can I be Insensible to the paramount duty pressing upon me to support the constitution, as it hat been entrusted to my care; and unless instructed to the contrary by the express will of my constituents, I shall endeavour, at the appointed season, to yield up my trust as unimpaired as can depend upon my humble but zealous exertions.&#x2014;I know, sir, that the doctrine has often been advanced, that a member of parliament is not to be limited in his duty by local attachment; that he is the representative not of a part but of the whole. This I reject; and were I to admit it generally, I should feel my own case a strong and overruling exception&#x2014;A great capital possesses peculiar and commanding influence over the representative; and to attempt to despise its sense, or divert its interests, is that bold and perilous kind of enterprise which I confess I dare not undertake. I feel embarked in one bottom with the city Of Dublin; and I never shall set my opinion above that of its electors; nor wilfully act in contradiction to their wishes. But, sir, while I profess to obey implicitly what I conceive or know to be the will of my constituents,I deprecate the remotest idea that I entertain is feeling hostile to my catholic countrymen, or that I am not as sincerely attached to their real interest as any gent. who this night supports the petition on your table. Sir,I know that if those interests had been honestly and truly consulted, petition Would not now be under discussion; a subject of such importance, involving such a variety of interests, and exciting such warmth of feeling,would never have been brought forward at such a time as this, nor have been made an instrument to embarrass the executive power, when the completest unanimity within and without these doors is necessary to oppose the most formidable and malignant enemy that ever1033threatened our political existence.&#x2014; The petitioners support their claims by the assertion of their loyalty. If that loyalty is questioned, it is not by me. No man has greater confidence in the loyalty of the Irish catholic, when left to the loyalty of the Irish catholic, when left to the genuine influence of his own heart; but I must remark, that the petition on your table holds out an indirect threat to parliament, and by asking you to do away those distinctions which make a foreign enemy rely upon the aid of disaffection, it in some degree admits, that should you not accede, such aid may be given, should the occasion offer. In the event of such a trial,I know the superior strength of Irish loyalty, and that my country, was never better prepared to meet and to crush a foreign or domestic foe. But, sir, I am willing for my own part distinctly to acquit the petitioners of any such meaning; and I wish the Irish catholic better than that he should derive from our fears what our prudence and inclination Would not grant him. I feel an anxiety for his honour as well as his interest; and I trust, that whatever he may receive on a future day from this house, shall be the result of cool, mature, and impartial deliberation, and be given to him in a manner consonant to that dignified weight which I wish every class of my countrymen to maintain in the scale of public opinion&#x2014; Should the day come when every,civil distinction shall be removed, I Wish the boon unaccompanied by reluctance and distrust; I wish it to be when the,Irish catholic is relieved from the odium and suspicion derived from his foreign connexions and influences, and when the directing head of his church shall not be the instrument and slave of that sanguinary despot, who is the implacable foe of the constitution and liberties of this empire. But,sir, is the house prepared to entertain this petition without going farther? What is to become of the English catholic and English dissenter? Sir,I should he ashamed,to look the latter or either in the face, if I committed such flagrant injustice as to exclude them alone from the privileges now required of us Without intending any invidious comparison, I know that his majesty does not possess a more loyal, sincerely attached, and valuable subject than the Irish dissenter; and the English dissenter may well be supposed not less meritorious. If there are tests to which those professing certain creeds cannot subscribe, are they alone to be bound by the influence of conscience, and its dominion denied where it should most prevail, and where it is the bond of1034our liberties and our laws? No, sir; and until some reconciling mean can be adopted, let us remain as we are, and all unite in maintaining against the. comon enemy that constitution so superior to all others, and which is the sole refuge of civil liberty in this quarter of the world.&#x2014;I ask pardon for having occupied the time of the house so long; but having the honour to represent the capital of that country, whose interests are so vitally involved in the present discussion, I felt it imperative upon me to lay before the house my reasons for voting against the present motion.", "author_id": "/people/sir-robert-shaw", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

(Dr. Duigenan) to an hon. gent.(Mr.Grattan) now a member of this house. The hon. and learned gent. did explain that passage perfectly correct. Now, sir, I will only add one word more. If the hon. gent. had gone further he would have found that what my noble relation did say, was this \"that if he was put to the necessity of chusing between the total emancipation of the catholics, or the re-enactment of the penal laws, in such an alternative he would prefer the latter as the lesser evil. He hoped, however, that the legislative union would remove the necessity of such an alternative.\" I trust I shall be pardoned for making this short explanation.

{"date": ["1805", "may", "14"], "content": "&#x2014;Sir; it is with great regret that I differ on this question from a very respectable part of my constituents; men for whose sentiments I shall ever entertain the greatest respect. The corporation of the city of Dublin, who have petitioned against the claims of the catholics, have ever been loyal to their king and constitution; zealous supporters of the protes1035tant establishment: and did I conceive that going into the committee would endanger that establishment, there is no one who would be more ready to give a negative to the motion of my hon. friend; but so far from thinking that the measure proposed would weaken that constitution, I am convinced it would not only tend to conform that establishment, but also strengthen the foundations upon which rests the security of the empire. The advantages to be derived from the adoption of this motion have been ably proves to be considerable in number and great in benefit; and, in my opinion, it has not been proved to this house, that any danger is likely to ensue from it. Granting for a moment, what I do not allow, but what the most violent opposers of the catholics could urge against them, that there exists in a part of that body of men a decided animosity to the British constitution, and a violent desire to effect its ruin; granting, for the sake of argument, that such is the disposition, such is the disposition, such is the object of men amongst the catholics, the means of effecting their purpose and accomplishing their wished would be totally destroyed by the measure proposed this night. Will the house consider what are the means by which the disaffected would endeavour to obtain their object? It has been already clearly proved, that admitting catholics to seats in parliament could never, in the opinion of any man in this house, give them sufficient weight in it to carry measures destructive to the constitution. It cannot be supposed that the number of Irish catholics, whether 20, 40, or even 100, that would be returned, could ever prevail on the remaining 558 English and Scotch members to unite with them in the destruction of a constitution they all venerate; which has raised their country to the height it now is placed in; for which their ancestors fought and bled; and for whose defence I trust, if called upon, we are all ready to risk our lives. No, sir, it never could be by parliament itself; but, possessing as they do a population of nearly four millions, would it not be by that physical force, aided and assisted by a foreign power, that they could alone hope for a probability of accomplishing their objects of overturning the constitution and separating the two countries? It is by arraying this population against you that they could alone be formidable: but by adopting this measure you will remove for ever the remotest possibility of their doing so; by giving an equality in1036the blessings and enjoyments of the constitution to this population, you will have them ranged not against you but for you. But while distinctions and inequalities exist; while you permit an appeal to their passions and perhaps to their reason, that though they equally contribute their property with their protestant fellow subjects; though they have spent and are daily spending their blood in defence of the constitution; though by their exertions they have added to the laurels and contributed to the safety of the empire; that though they have patiently and cheerfully shared with the protestant equal dangers in time of war; yet they are not allowed to share equal advantages in the hour of peace: such an appeal must have some weight upon the mind; and though it would not separate those who have still many reasons to be attached to the constitution; yet, by destroying the possibility of its being made, you weaken the efforts of your enemies. It is these distinctions that have given rise to a spirit of party, that has been the misfortune of Ireland; that has constantly and uniformly checked its progress towards improvement in time of peace, and I am sure increased its dangers in time of war. By removing the conviction in one man's mind that he possesses superior advantages, in the other that he labours under disabilities and restraints; by taking away this double conviction yoy will give a death blow tom party spirit; for it is by this policy alone that the violent of both parties have been able to agitate and irritate; I should almost have said exasperate the minds of the people against each other, even at times when the situation of the country and the danger of the state imperiously demanded harmony and unanimity. This subject has been so ably argued on this side of the house, and so feebly, in my opinion, on the other, that I feel it is but pressing on the patience of the house to urge any thing more in favour of the motion. But I cannot avoid stating how much will be gained by the destruction of all party spirit. Consider Ireland with a liberal mind you will lament the disunion of her people; but look at the situation of Europe, and the contest in which we are engaged, you will not only look at it with sorrow, but you will see the necessity of endeavouring to harmonize and unite. We may hope to defend Ireland by having the command of the seas, by blockading the fleets of our enemies; this mode of defence has failed already, and may again fail; but give to Ireland, to all its people, an equal interest in the defence of the1037constitution equal enjoyments of its blessings, you will then have a defence invulnerable by your enemy, which I doubt if the enemy would dare to encounter; but which should he attempt, I have not the smallest doubt that the result would be defeat to him and security to us.", "author_id": "/people/mr-john-latouche", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

If the hon. member had made his motion on that ground, or with a view to such an object, he should have felt himself bound to give it every opposition, because there was nothing of the nature of a charge against him in the papers which he could not completely and satisfactorily refute. There were, he would not dispute, several matters contained in these papers, which it was desirable to have referred to a committee, and consequently he was not disposed to object to the motion, provided that in so doing, he should not be considered as giving any acknowledgement of any well founded charge against himself. Many gentlemen, no doubt, had read the whole of the papers, and from being acquainted with their contents were competent to decide whether such a step was not expedient. His object in rising had been to state a general outline of his conduct, by adverting, if he should be permitted, to what had passed on a former night. The hon. member (Mr. Kinnaird) had on that occasion stated, that he had been treated conformably to the usual practice of the navy; that he had been treated in the same manner as three gallant and hon. officers whom he had mentioned by name, sir Richard King, sir Richard Bickerton, and sir Andrew Mitchell. He had been extremely surprised to hear this assertion, and though he knew that each of these officers had attended the different boards, he had been so nervous that he could not bring himself to contradict an assertion so confidently made. But he had yesterday received a letter from sir R. King,639confirming his own opinion, and stating that that gallant officer, on his return from India, had had occasion to attend and correspond with the different boards on the subject of his accounts. The navy board were justified, therefore, in the concluding paragraph of their letter, wherein they had stated, that in his case there had been a deviation from the ordinary practice of the board, and that he had been singled out, as the victim to such a course. He had felt it necessary to advert to this circumstance, because of the impression that might have been made on the house by the statement of the hon. member, and because at the time of making it, the hon. gentleman had held in his hand, as a document, the scurrilous pamphlet that had been published reflecting on him. That it was usual for officers to attend the different boards on such occasions, he proved by reading an extract from a letter of the navy board to captain Sauce, contained in the papers, in which that officer was called on to attend them on the Friday after the date of their letter. In another letter, they called on him to explain why he had provided the Sensible, at Calcutta, with a greater quantity of stores than were allowed for ships of that class; and in a letter it was stated that such increase had arisen from an alteration of the establishment of that vessel. The fact was, however, that he had never given orders for such alteration, nor had it ever taken place in the establishment of the Sensible. His letter to the navy board would prove that the Sensible had been nearly a wreck in the Red Sea; and he had given directions to contract for two sets of sails for her, provided, however, that if she foundered at sea, or should not arrive, no expence should accrue to government: as to the establishment of the vessel, he had given orders that such a provision of stores should be made as would fit the vessel for any establishment which the lords of the admiralty should think proper. General Baird, on his, arrival in the Red Sea, had proposed to him a plan, by the desire of the governor-general, for attacking, in the event of the expulsion of the French from Egypt, and the return of the Indian army, either the Mauritius or Batavia. He was not prepared to say, that the force under his command at the time was adequate to such an expedition, but he was anxious to have it in such a state of equipment as to be ready for any service required. As to the an-640chor, upon which so much stress had been laid, it now appeared that the whole matter was a mistake of the navy board. He owed it to the curiosity of a brother officer, who hearing so much about this circumstance, had examined the original records at Chatham, and found that the ring and shank of the anchor lost in the Indian sea had been returned to that arsenal, that this mistake was corrected; his own letters to the navy board on the subject having been among the papers lost. When he had sailed for India, he had a strong westerly breeze, and he found the ship so crazy, so rotten, and so leaky, that he was obliged to put into Portland Roads, and if it had not been for the importance of the service on which he was proceeding, he should not have ventured in her. He then proceeded to the Cape, afterwards to the Red Sea and to Calcutta, where she was near sinking, as would appear from the papers. He trusted that the bad and leaky state in which his vessel was there, would be a satisfactory reason to the house for the repairs she had undergone. From the first moment of his hearing that an unfavourable impression was entertained of his conduct by the admiralty, he had pressed earnestly for a hearing. He had passed, under the imputations that followed, the strongest and severest ordeal that any officer ever had. This would be evident from a reference to the strange accounts that had been made up, as would appear from the letter of the navy board by Mr. Tucker. They had been told in that of criminal prosecutions, and if those should not answer, of the matter being carried into the exchequer. But he contended that the law that ought to have been appealed to was martial law; that law which had upheld the navy of England. He ought, if supposed guilty, to have been brought to a court martial, rather than to have been made the subject of a paper war. He should have met the court martial with the same fortitude that he had shewn in meeting the scurrilous pamphlet to which he had before alluded, which, from a letter in his possession, that he was almost ashamed to read, he had reason to think had proceeded from a source which ought not to have stooped to such unworthy expedients. The hon. member here read a letter signed John M'Namara, stating, in answer to a question put by him to that gentleman, that he had heard, from the publisher of the pamphlet, that it had come from lord St. Vincent's641board of admiralty. Before he should touch upon the other points, he begged leave to advert to a letter written by the navy board, dated 11th of Feb. 1802, to capt. Mitchell, composed of exhortations and threats, and affording an extraordinary instance of an attempt to influence the evidence of an interior officer. This letter called on capt. Mitchel seriously to exhort his boatswain to state all he knew, and to inform him, that from the state of his accounts his evidence might have very serious consequences.

They called upon an inferior officer to rack his memory for any thing during the course of two years that could be brought against the conduct of his captain. He should not deny, and it was what might happen to any officer, that he might have committed some irregularities; but he was sure, he had not been guilty of any criminal irregularities, that could call for, or warrant the criminal industry that had been employed to decry his character. The whole transaction had been submitted to the commissioners of naval enquiry, whose conduct had been so ably argued, and so universally applauded in that house, that he should feel a pride in abiding by the issue of their examination of Mr. Lewis, and in their report thereon to the house. The hon. gent. in his opening speech on this subject, had stated, that he would feel as much pleasure as any hon. gent. if the investigation of the business should be favourable to the person who was the object of it. Nothing could so completely exculpate him from the calumnies that had been propagated against him, as a proof that there was no collusion between him and the naval officer alluded to. On this subject he had written a short and pithy letter to the naval commissioners, calling on them to state, whether, even from inference or misrepresentation, it appeared by the examination of Mr. Lewis, that any collusion existed between himself and that officer. They replied, that they had made their report to642the three branches of the legislature, and that they could not answer his question. He had in every instance retrenched expences, but on a scale deserving the attention of an officer. As to the canvass, which did not exceed in value 12l. and the junk not 21l. though the account occupied 3 pages in the report, neither could be supposed worthy of notice. He had deemed it necessary to advert to these topics, and might have expressed himself with some warmth, but he was sure that would be overlooked, when it was considered how long he had been exposed to the calumnies so industriously propagated against him, and how severely his own and his family's feelings must have been affected. In the whole of the expenditure he had been regulated by a desire to have his ships as highly and as well dressed as they could be. He had given orders in drawing for money that no bills should be drawn at a higher exchange than 2s. 6d. which was lower than the rate of exchange on bills drawn by admiral Blanket, who had also been in the Red Sea. In the rations also there was a saving. The diminution in the extravagant expence of transport tonnage had been very considerable. On his arrival in the Red Sea he had taken upon himself the management of the whole of the company's transport tonnage, and in a short time made a reduction an the expence to the amount of 17,000l: per month, which he had followed up till the saving amounted to 27,000l. He did not advert to these circumstances as instances of any great merit on his part; what he had done was only his bounden duty. He could not, however, but confess that he might have been a little extravagant with respect to his flying sails; but he trusted an additional expence of a few pounds for such an object would not be looked upon as a ground of disapprobation of his conduct. He had the testimony of the marquis Wellesley as to his measures of reform and retrenchment, together with an assurance of every assistance to enable him to continue them. Thus far he had thought it necessary to state the outlines of his whole conduct, and, as he had stated at first, he had no objection to the appointment of a committee, provided his acquiescence should not be construed into an admission of the validity of any charge against him. The report of the committee, he trusted, would be as favourable to his character as he could wish. If he had erred, he had the satisfaction to know, that643he had not erred from principle. He did not mean to say, that ignorance was any justification of an officer's conduct, but he was of opinion that that conduct should be considered on a great scale, and with a just attention to every part of it. He was sensible that he was addressing the most liberal and enlightened assembly in the world, and except the moment that should restore him to the service in which he gloried, the moment of referring his whole conduct to their decision was the happiest of his life.

{"date": ["1805", "may", "14"], "content": "&#x2014;Sir; I shall not now further trespass on the patience of the house, than to contradict some unfounded assertions made by the hon. mover and a distinguished supporter of this petition (Mr. Grattan); but first I must notice, from the-time and circumstances under which this measure has been brought forward, that I very much question the sincerity of the agitators of it, and for various considerations, do pronounce it a party trick. (A cry of order! order!)I feel, sir, My words are not strictly in order, and I shall change them. I pronounce then, sir, that this question has been brought forward at this time to obtain thereby the weight and support and support of the influence of the catholic body to serve party purposes; this, it is not disorderly for me as a member of this house to state, and it is the truth. The mover of this petition knew full well that obstacles insurmountable stood in the way of its success; that the minister, after consulting the highest authorities, and the judgments of the most experienced Men around him, deemed it expedient to decline bringing it forward himself, and advised that it should not be offered to parliament. The leading and best disposed catholics themselves are believed to have held the same sentiments as to the propriety of withholding their claims for the present; but I charge that opposition, aided by the democratic part of the Catholics,over-ruled this determination, and forced forward this discussion. The hon. mover of the petition1041and his friends were impelled by the hope of thereby discharging themselves from an obligation to the catholics, and of fixing against the minister the forfeiture of an alleged pledge he had given to that body; from this, however, the chancellor of the exchequer has been exculpated, although he does still hold opinions favourable to their claims&#x2014; I have myself been constantly in the habits (I speak it with due humility) of giving for many years my best political support; but I cannot, on the present occasion, consider him altogether blameless, feeling as I do that no individual possessed of great authority, both from his character and situation, ought to announce his opinion and his desire to make such an innovation in the constitution, without in some degree giving the protestants a detail of those guards and securities (Which he alludes to merely in general terms) for their liberties and for their estates.&#x2014; Previous to the possibility of admitting catholics to sit and vote in parliament with safety to the constitution, there are many alterations which their church and people ought to admit I shall not detail them, because I should still have my doubts;. but sure I am,the catholics themselves ought (if they are anxious to be believed sincere in their professions) to make every change in their church government and discipline which protestant security can require, and which the essentials of Roman catholic faith will permit: such reform would afford more substantial security than reiterated promises, and professions, and tests.&#x2014; There is one preliminary indispensable; I mean a sufficient establishment, or fund from whence to pay their clergy. The Irish parliament has given them a seminary for the education of their candidate clergy, has endowed it magnificently, induced, to do so from the policy of placing over the ignorant lower orders in Ireland,a well-educated englightened set of gentlemen. Having done so, it appears to me a necessary consequence that a provision should be made for that clergy by the state, than that they should be left dependent on a savage multitude for their means of life, and be reduced to the necessity of flattering the propensities and passions of that multitude, and conniving at, if not encouraging their crimes You must therefore, in order to rescue them from such a thraldom, and render them either good or safe members of the community, give them a moderate independence, and place them above such neces-1042sity.&#x2014;I shall now, sir, content myself with nothing , as I proposed, some mis-statements, and disproving them only at this late hour, by contradicting them without much detail.&#x2014; The hon. mover has alleged that the ferocious manners of the protestants of Ireland towards the catholics has rendered the latter description barbarous; if true it is that they are babarous, or unfit to enjoy civil liberty in its full extent: and yet both he and one of his friends (Grattan) deprecate any allusion to violences heretofore committed. So do I; but if such assertions are made, truth must be told. Too many proofs exist up to the present hour of the aggressions and savage bigotry of the catholics; the history of centuries past proves it; modern times prove it; the white-boy transactions in the south twenty years before the rebellion prove it; Wexford fatally and lamentably proves it; Dr. M' Nevin proves it, who tells you of their antipathy to protestants and Englishmen, whom they consider to be the same; and that the catholic body could at any time be brought forward to rebellion by the agency of their priests, whom the leaders of the united Irishmen knew they could set in motion at any moment when requisite, and therefore it was that these leaders first directed their efforts to associate the protestants of the north of Ireland by throwing out the lure of parliamentary reform. But I revolt from these allusions as much as opposition, whose unfounded assertions render them necessary&#x2014; I deny utterly the colouring and statement of the seconder of this motion(Grattan) of the events and occurrences, and their causes, of the last twenty years. but more particularly as applicable to our unfortunate disturbances. I do shortly allege that the party occasioned by the[...]proceedings of parliament in 1789, during the regency, laid the groundwork of the united Irish union, of the commotions, the rebellion, and consequent legislative union between Great-Britain and Ireland.&#x2014;The king's recovery and discomforture of opposition produced those unconstitutional appeals of the hon. seconder and his friends to the physical force of the country. Too well for the peace of Ireland did he instruct them to reflect and rely upon that force; he and his friends, with this doctrine in their mouths, bid for and misled the protestants of the north,(a gallant race of men devoted to constitutional liberty) by promising them parliamentary reform; the1043same gentleman bid for the catholic, by promising them emancipation, Accordingly the united Irish association was formed in 1791&#x2013;2, and a catholic convention was held in Dublin, and a protestant convention at Dungannon, in furtherance of these objects emancipation and reform. I shall not comment on these events; they were endeavoured to be curbed by lord Clare's convention act, made subsequently with that view. In 1795 lord Fitzwilliam came lord-lieutenant to Ireland, and the mover of this petition asserts that his recal and the breach of promise at this time to the catholics produced the rebellion of 1798. In making this assertion, he pronounces on his friend (Grattan) the most bitter, heart-rending judgement, that most bitter, heart-rending judgement, that could have fallen from the lips of a friend; for he thereby charges him with being the author of that rebellion.&#x2014;I do positively in proof of this assert and defy contradiction that lord Fitzwilliam was sent to Ireland with an instruction from the cabinet of England to keep back the catholic claims, and further assert, that no autorised promise was made to them. But what did the worthy recorder (Grattan) do? Having been in London with lord Fitzwilliam, to consult and advise with him on his future government of Ireland, he preceded him to that country, and instantly on his arrival set every political engine at work, every channel of influence and flattery he possessed, to urge forward the catholic with their claims from all parts, insomuch that shortly after lord Fitzwilliam did arrive the whole mischief was completed. The cabinet felt he had disobeyed their orders, and he was recalled; the catholics were not gratified. The hon. mover says rebellion was the consequence; if so, the house will estimate the obligation of his friend (Mr. Grattan) to him for his allusion to the fact.&#x2014;After this period the catholics were advised by public address not to postpone their claims. England was in emphatic language. described to be their enemy; that she must be pressed by them in time of war; the catholics must not postpone their claims to a moment of peace&#x2014; they must be listened to in a time of distress and pressure to England.&#x2014; Is it for this reason they are brought forward of 1798 and the union of the two parliaments finish the period on which the two honourable friends have mostly dwelt&#x2014; I now be g leave to deny their assertions to the proportnate numbers of protestants and catholics;1044they are unapproved, and are made only for intimidation.&#x2014; I must also deny the hon. mover's doctrine of the principle of the British constitution as applied to the claim of power or franchise. I allege the principle to be equal protection to all, and rights of power or franchise to qualified persons. The guards of this constitution in the exercise of power or franchise, are tests and the possession of property.&#x2014;I must also:notice a very loose proof he offers to us,that the catholics will not, if in power, meddle with property: the gentleman himself does not profess to approve of the act of settlement, but the catholics would not, he says, disturb it, because some of them have lately acquired property secured by it. At best this is no more than an appeal to their forbearance, and quantum of interest in it&#x2014;I shall, now lastly, make an observation on the property in Ireland. It exceeds, I am confident, in the hands of the protestants that which is in the hands of the catholics by a proportion which far outstrips the population of the latter beyond the former. I dare say it is more than as,twenty to one: for this we have an undoubted right to have a sufficient security. In five or six northern Irish counties there is not one catholic gentleman qualified from estate to be a member of parliament, or indeed that you ever meet in society; and this not from any severity of exclusion, but really that they do exist amongst us. If then catholics were eligible to parliament, and that the lower orders there are, as alleged, three to one, we should either be represented by strangers or by unlettered boors; for most, unquestionably if the freeholders were catholic the priests would carry them for the catholic candidate. Property is the criterion of political power more than the physical force of the self-willed multitude. The protestants possess this superiority, and love the constitutional liberty which accompanies it they have defended and fought for both in 1688 and 1798. I deny that the rebellion of 1798 was put down by other means than the protestant exertions of Ireland; it was overcome and reduced before one English militia regiment landed in that country (I feel at the same time every gratitude for the zeal and succour intended by that force;) and if ever so direful a necessity should occur again, from either invasion or rebellion, I trust to the mutual support of the army and volunteers of both countries, and, in despite of all forebodings, have no doubt of the result.", "author_id": "/people/sir-george-hill", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

(Mr. H Addington) on the subject of the speech of a noble viscount, (Sidmouth) in the course of a former debate. If I have not been misrepresented, I believe it will be found, that what I strictly said, was not that the noble lord said that catholic emancipation would be the effect of the union, but that the union was a pledge of catholic emancipation. I stated, that the noble viscount, in his speech, said there were three things to be considered; one, with a view to the former laws against the catholics; another, with a view to catholic emancipation, of both which he disapproved; but would, of the two evils prefer the enactment of the penal laws; and the third, with reference to a legislative union, which he said, would not be productive of any of the disadvantages of either of the other measures. Having stated this as one of the things which did give hopes to the catholics. I thought the1046measure proposed in their favour would not be objectionable to the noble viscount.&#x2014;With regard to the objections against my motion, I shall speak to those which apply in point of time first; for though they came last, they are first in point of order; and, first of all, let me make a remark on the objections which came from a right hon. gent. opposite.

He stands, as far as this debate goes, perfectly singular, in stating his objections to the petition, in point of time. I shall consider the objections in themselves, and then, as coming from him: and, first of all, in point of time, with regard to myself&#x2014;I have no defence to make &#x2014;for I say, let my conduct in bringing the question forward be attended with whatever imputation it may, I an ready to say there is no time of my life when, if any set of men applied to me to support a petition in favour of religious liberty, I should not have complied with the requisition. With regard to what has fallen from an hon. bart. (sir G. Hill) on the subject of this being a party question, I can only say, that if his opinion was to be followed, and we were to consider every thing as a\" party trick,\" as he is pleased to call it, because we did not expect that it would be attended with success, we should render the constitution of this country some what singular, and certainly the whole tenour of my life would have been contrary to the opinion of that hon. gent. With respect to the time, I say, I should at any time have presented this petition, for I always considered that every man had a right to the free enjoyment of his religious liberty, subject to what may arise from considerations of public safety. As I do not believe there ever has been any possible injury to the public safety, by extending religious liberty to those who ask it , I must of necessity think it right to extend it to the catholics. As to the time, with respect to those who have signed the petition, the objection founded on their omitting to have it brought forward before, is most extraordinary; for it is admitted, that in the way the measure of union was argued and defende the catholic had, without a positive pledge, some reasonable1047ground to hope that their petition, or the matter of their petition, would be granted. This is not all. Those who were most averse to the catholic claims argued it in a way not like the right hon. gent. opposite, who appeared to me to think that the union would pave the way for the grant of the catholic claims, that it took away the only difficulty which belonged to the discussion of the question, and that, when the union was completed, it would be in the view of many, more safe to grant their claims or less dangerous to resist them. If I am told, that the establishment of the measure of the union will produce a time when the claims can be brought forward with propriety, and cannot be refused without danger, I desire to know whether that is not precisely the period, when men who wish well to their country would naturally be inclined to bring them under discussing the claims of any class of subjects than that in which it is admitted they can be granted without danger? I should therefore, have supposed, that all who thought the union the most certain means of preventing the danger, would have conceived the completion of that union the time peculiarly proper for the catholics to submit, and a member of parliament to recommend, a measure which the friends of it considered right, just, and equitable, to be adopted. But what then? You say to them, \"help us in this union; give us that assistance which is necessary to us.\" Many of the catholics do so; and then your friends, and the friends of the union, tell them they have great hopes their claims may be granted Then the petition comes, as might naturally be expected it would come, after such an assurance; and in return for the assistance given by the catholics, it is proposed to say, \"do not discuss the question at all.\" It may be said, \" why did not the catholics come immediately after the union?\" I do not wish to enter into an altercation on that subject; it is most probable that the cause of their not coming sooner was, that the right hon. gent's resignation, accompanied with the reasons he gave for that resignation, induced them to adopt the opinion , that they could not with propriety bring their claims forward at that time. Bait the right hon. gent. in a letter written by him gives the catholics a justifiable gro of hope, that it would be a part of his future plan to smooth the way by preparing the public to receive the catholic petition. What must have been the im1048pression on the minds of the catholics in consequence of this? They must have thought that the right hon. gent., during the two years he was out of office, would have directed his attention to the subject, and that he was a little negligent of their concerns, if he did not take quite so much pains as he ought to have done. But it was natural for the catholics, when they saw the right hon. gent. returning to office; when they recollected they had heard him say, that, entertaining the opinion he did of the catholics, he could neither, bring their claims forward with safety, or continue in his office with propriety: I repeat it was natural for them to say, that \"although we did not consider your conduct as a pledge on your part, or a claim on ours, yet when you declared you could not bring the subject forward with hopes of success, nor continue in office, unless you could do so, we had a right to depend on your support, whenever the opportunity was afforded you of granting it. Thus, when we now see you returning to office, we may reasonably conclude you are in a situation. in which you Play support, encourage, and promote those claims, of which you approved.\" This was the natural time for the catholics to apply to the right. hon. gent. for srpport, and for him to grant it. I think it is impossible that I can misrepresent what the right hon. gent. said four years ago, in the course of a debate on the state of the nation, and I think that all he has said to-night is a proof that understood him He said, that considering the turn the question had taken, considering the infinite importance of the subject to the empire at large, he thought he could not move it with all the advantages necessary to its success, or atleast to that species of success, as he expressed it, which would be productive of the result Ultimately to be desired; that, under such circumstances, he felt not only that he could not move it himself, but that if it was moved, he should feel it is duty to resist it. If it is true that he told us so, surely it was natural for persons. in the situation of the catholics to suppose, that when he returned to office, he would attend to this Circumstance. It seems to me, that this night he has gone a good way in stating the singularity of his own conduct. He said, that the question could not advantageously be brought forward, unless with the general concurrence of every branch of the legislature. Such was the reason, he tells you, that he did not bring it on. This1049I admit is perfectly consistent with his former professions; yet I think, that in the year 1801, as well as if he was to do so in 1805, he did take a further measure of no small importance to his reputation, and the welfare of the country, by putting an end to his own administration. He has stated all he did at that period. He stated his sentiments then, as he has done now; and I cannot but remark that, in giving an account of his conduct, there is a material alteration and difference in his conduct in 1805, with reference to what it was in 1801. with reference to what it was in 1801. Yet, he has so conducted himself, that it was impossible the Roman catholics of Ireland could know that such a difference of opinion existed, or that his opinions and sentiments were not similar to what they had been. They must have concluded, from the very circumstance of his being in office, that it was his intention either to move, or to support the question. I believe that idea was so firmly impressed on the minds of the catholics, that he could not imagine the fact was otherwise. Many persons undoubtedly thought that there might be some circumstances which might make it proper to defer the consideration of the subject to another session; if from prudential motives it had been recommended to them to defer the consideration of the subject to a future period, I have no doubt that, with the opinions they were actuated by, they would have readily acquiesced. But when they found that the right hon. gent. could neither now bring their claims forward, that the objections against them would equally slay at any given time, and that, when he continued in office, contrary to his own example in 1801, they concluded, as justly they might, that he had completely changed his mind. It was under that circumstance, and the impression it excited, they came to me; and now, because they have come to me, is it to be said, that they have made themselves the allies of a party? I wish to know what will become of this house, and eventually of the government, and the constitution of the country, if those, who are refused redress by ministers, and appeal to men who, for good reasons, oppose ministers are to be stigmatised with adhering to a party. Are those who oppose administration to be incapacitated, merely for so doing, as independent members of parliament? Are we, the free, uncontrolled, and independent members of this house, and the representatives of the people of England,1050to be excommunicated in our political capacity, because we are in the performance of a duty adverse to the sentiments of those ministers whose conduct we condemn? We talk of the excommunications of the pope, but can his anathemas be more unjust that those which stigmatise those as the allies of a party, who apply to us for the establishment of their undoubted rights, privileges, and civil and religious immunities, denied to them by ministers, who ought to be foremost in granting them? All I can say is, that I have attentively read the history of the country, but I have formed a very imperfect notion of its constitution, if those who oppose ministers, or who bring forward measures which should originate in them, are to be branded as the instruments of party and as hostile to those principles to which our free government owes its existence, and pre-eminence among nations. The catholics came to me, because a better chance of success did not present itself to their hopes. They came to me, because they conceived, and I hope truly, that I would do justice to their cause, and because they thought I would do my utmost to be instrumental in bringing it to a successful issue. Is it to be said, because we are not sanguine in our hoped of success, that therefore we ought not to promote enquiry and investigation upon any subject? Is no man to be justified in moving a question of public concern and importance, merely because he does not conceive it will be carried? I beg leave to say, that I am decidedly of a different opinion. I think the house will judge as members of a British parliament ought to judge, that it is their duty to pursue a question of this kind in spite of every temporary obstacle. I am of opinion, that whatever may be, or may have been in another place, the decision upon this question, the discussion will be productive of the greatest good to the country. The complete refutation of the number of false facts which have been advanced, must, and will be attended with the best effects. I am confident that the arguments we have heard, whatever effect they may have upon this house, will have their due weight with the public, and that every man of common sense will see on which side the weight of the argument lies. I am confident, upon another ground of policy, expediency, and justice, that this discussion will be productive of the utmost benefit, because1051I am convinced, that if I had refused to present the petition of the catholics, and the impression had gone over to Ireland, that there was not a member to be found in the British house of commons willing to present their petition, it would have produced a state of despondency and despair in the mind of the people of that country, which would have been fatal to the best interests of the whole empire. They would rightly, but fatally, as to the probable consequences, have judged that there was not only no party, but no individual in England, to whom they could look up with a confident hope of redress. Is it, can it be necessary for me to state to this enlightened house, that a more fatal event cannot happen, or is more to be deprecated, than that three-fourths of the population of Ireland should be justified in the dreadful reflection, that there is not a man in England who sympathises with their sufferings, or who is inclined to exert himself in order to obtain the redress of them? Although such a reflection may be turned to the extreme disadvantage of the empire, I do trust that the people of Ireland will not reason in this manner. I hope they will not say, \"we have no friends in England, and therefore we must look elsewhere.\" Yet the time has been, when such an inference might have been stated with more probability than perhaps at rhe present moment. It has been said, \"let us finish the question for ever.\" When, I would ask, was it known that such a question could be finished for ever? \" Man and for ever!\" history shews us, that the most visionary notion ever entertained never went the length of implying that a question of this nature could be finished for ever. Will not the catholics look back to the parliament of their own country&#x2014;refer to the period of the year 1791? That was a period when no member of parliament could be found to present a petition in their favour. In the year 1792, their petition was presented, and it was rejected by a very large majority; the minority consisting, as nearly as I can recollect, of no more than fourteen or fifteen members. It was then said the question was closed for ever. I dare say the gentlemen who stated that, thought the revival of the question would overturn the protestant government, and the established constitution of the country. They undoubtedly thought that the time for agitating the question was improper and dangerous, and therefore it was that they said the question was, and ought to be closed for ever. Was it closed for ever? Did the1052event prove that it Was Closed for ever? No. On the contrary, Within twelve Months after the question was said to have been closed for ever, it was resumed, and a majority of that house, which had closed the question for ever, did grant the catholics more in the year 1793, than in the year 1792 the catholics had thought it necessary to ask; and in so doing they did right; for if you look back to the history of this reign, you will find, that, in almost every instance,what has been refused to the humble prayer of any class of subjects, who have considered themselves aggrieved, has been granted afterwards by the fears of government. When this country was engaged in a War with France, it was fear and imperious necessity which induced you to grant that, than which lesser claims were refused in 1792. Let me not be accused of menace, when leave it to the consideration of this house, whether at different periods of the history of this reign, with reference to its. Various dependencies, government has not, by sad experience, found that the best time for granting indulgences, or, to speak more properly, natural rights, would have been when they were first asked for. If this is menace, then I think prudence must be altogether must be altogether banished from our consideration: there is no claim of right which may not be construed into menace. If We are compelled to satisfy the claim, and at the same time, are to be told that the claim is menace, I ask how we ought to have acted at the beginning of the American war? How are we to warn you by the example of the past, unless it is by shewing you that, to avoid danger, you should make concessions in time? I must further observe, with regard to the objections which the right hon. gent. took in point of time, that if his particular object was to conciliate those who were hostile to this measure, not with reference to time, bur principle, his objections, in my opinion, have not been very successful. I do not indeed conceive, that the right hon. gent. has urged the argument in our favour with any other than honourable views; but after all the ingenious language we have heard; after all the illiberal arguments which have been advanced, all the ignorance which has been uttered, all the aspersions which have been thrown out, and all the dangerous principles which have been recommended, and attempted to be maintained, for the purpose of rejecting this question for ever; I say, that although I cannot help lamenting we could not have the benefit of his vote, yet I rejoice that we1053have the advantage of his discountenancing what, he must feel, reflects as much honour on his principles four years ago, as disgrace now. His vote undoubtedly would have been of advantage to the country; bur his speech is of much more advantage. It is not merely the vote of the right hon. gent. that would be important, but it is of consequence, that in England, Ireland, and every part of the British empire, it should be known, that the opinion of men in power, or likely to be in power, or whose authority or interest is looked up to with confidence, is favourable to the cause to which the vote of the right hon. gent. is adverse. I wish we could have had his vote, but I thank him for his argument; and this brings me to another part of his conduct. The right hon. gent. says, that he finds not only now, but that three or four years past, the public opinion was contrary to mine. If he had brought forward this question when he was out of office, he might have stated some grounds which would have made it less dangerous to be encouraged than at the present moment. If he had stated that fact, and the public had seen that most of the considerable men in parliament were of one opinion, though his opinion would have done much, yet the argument Would have done more, and the public opinion would not, perhaps, have taken that turn, he tells us it has: whether it has taken that turn, or not, I doubt; I own I see no symptom of it. There are unquestionably very respectable bodies of men, some of whom have given their opinion contrary to the Opinion I profess: but that there is a generally prevailing opinion adverse to mine, I cannot suspect; I cannot think, that, among rational men, the advantages which present themselves on the one hand, and the dangers which menace on the other, can be overlooked. The claims of the catholics are not only consistent with the principles of the constitution, but Consonant to its vial spirit, and I hope and trust the public opinion will ultimately be led by reason to that point, to which, if it is not led, I am sorry to say, we shall not have the full, and effective force, and physical strength of the united empire. If ever there was a time when it was necessary we should have its entire exertion, it is the present. This is a period when all our energies are called into action.Toto certandum est corpore regni.But who can say the country has the effectual advantage of the corpus regni, while1054one-fifth of its inhabitants are deprived of those privileges they ought to enjoy, and without which, to them, the country is nothing? But the argument is taken two ways: first, you say you have no fears from the catholics; that if you trusted them they would be loyal; and that, therefore, what danger is to be apprehended from them? I would answer, \"give to them, then, what they claim, as the reward of their loyalty.\" Are we to argue without reference to the general principles of human nature? The proper way to weigh the justice of an argument is by the scale of common sense, and the feelings of mankind upon the subject; but if the argument drawn from the loyalty of the Roman catholics is to be used against them, to their prejudice, I can only say, that it is more disgraceful to the public, than even to the speaker. They say these gentlemen, I mean the Roman catholics, are loyal; I truly believe they are so; nay, I believe that if you refuse their claims, many in their zeal, public spirit, and loyalty, will go far beyond what they can fairly be called upon for; but can I expect as much from the generality of the catholics? Do we not say, that out country being under the freest constitution in the world, the subject enjoys the greatest degree of civil and political liberty, terms which imply no difference, except that the word civil is derived from the Latin, and the word political from the Greek. Do we not enjoy the most important privileges of any nation in Europe We boast that we shall be able to make exertions against the enemy, that the subjects of arbitrary governments cannot be expected to make. Why is this? It is because we are fighting for laws that are our laws, for a constitution that is our constitution, for those liberties and sacred immunities which no other country under heaven possesses the advantages of fighting for. If, sir, such are the grounds on which, under God, we trust so much to for our success, do they not apply with equal force to another country, or rather another part of our own country? And do you not suppose, that those who fight for greater privileges, will exert themselves more than those men who are deprived of the civil and political advantages enjoyed by their fellow-citizens? If the same exertions cannot be expected by those who are deprived of the privileges to which they are entitled, what do we gain by the disabilities we impose on them? You put the country in the situation in which you are compelled, of necessity, to confess, you have no other1055expectation than that of comparative exertion. I ask you. whether that is not the true state of the case with regard to the Roman catholics of Ireland? I will not urge further than I did, when I opened this subject, the argument, that the privileges bestowed upon the higher orders of people are, in point of fact, enjoyed by the lower. No answer has been given to the argument, and therefore I must take it as a principle admitted. No one has attempted to contradict the opinion that the lower orders are influenced by the advantages and the privileges bestowed on their superiors. Those who recollect the debates two years ago, may furnish their minds with as strong an illustration on this subject as any argument can possibly produce. It was two years since an hon. member, then secretary at war, brought in a bill for raising an army enmasse. After having explained the details of the bill, as it applied to Great Britain, he did conclude with a short sentence, which every body well understood, and with regard to which no one thought any comment was necessary. The sentence was to the effect, that it was not thought expedient to apply the bill to Ireland. It would certainly have been indiscretion, in the true sense of the word, either to have applied it to Ireland, or to have commented on the reason for not applying it. Why? Because it was well known that the mass of the people of Ireland were not like the mass of the people of England; because they consisted of two divided partied, in the lower of which you could not have the same confidence as in the higher; and therefore it was that in England the levy en masse, which constituted the best security of the country, was in Ireland looked to as its greatest source of danger I will refer gentlemen to the bill for promoting our military force and national defence. I remember, in the course of one day's discussion, relative to the force in Ireland at the time of the debate. compared with the period of the treaty of Amiens, that a statements was made of so much cavalry, so much infantry, so much artillery, and so many fencibles. It was then admitted on both sides, that with regard to such and such regiments, there was a circumstance that made country; that circumstance was, that there were no Irish among them. It was stated and admitted, that for the reason I have mentioned, there were two or three regiments as available as four or five. Apply this to England, or to any other1056country that is well governed, would any body say that our military force was strong, because it consisted of foreigners, or that it was weak, because it was composed of Englishmen? Would you not argue, that so much the more would be expected from men, who were fighting for their own country, their homes, their fortunes, and all that was dear to them? Why is the argument different with respect to Ireland? Why do you wish to have the regiments in Ireland with as few Irish as possible? The argument is this, and you may reduce it to a syllogism, of which the major is, every man is most to be depended upon in proportion to his interest in the constitution. The minor is, Englishmen are most interested in their constitution; ergo, the conclusion is, Englishmen are most to be depended upon. Apply this, on the other hand, to Ireland, and, altering the terms of the syllogism, the conclusion will be the reverse; the minor will be, that the Irish catholics are the least interested in the constitution, and therefore they are the least to be relied on to defend it. It is on this principle you would have your regiments in England composed of Englishmen, and in Ireland not composed of Irishmen. Who are so little interested in Ireland as the Irish Roman catholics? None. Yet such is the state of that country, in which you say nothing is to be obtained by gaining over the hearts and energies of three-fourths of the population. It is said, are not those nobleman and gentlemen, who compose the higher class of the people of Ireland, loyal? If they are, why would you give them any thing to make them more so? I would give them the same interest in the constitution of the country which others have, and then I may reasonably expect similar exertions from them. We say it is little for them to gain, and much for us to give. They say it is much for them to gain, and little for us to give. What is it we give? All we give away is political power! To whom do we give that power? To the catholics Who are the catholics? Our fellow subjects. &#x2014; I come now to the objection as to the particular form. It is objected to giving hopes to the catholics, because it is said, how can I desire the house to go into a committee, if I do not know that the committee will support me in all the points in favour of the catholics? Has not this objection been answered, standing on different grounds; surely no one will say, that we ought not to1057go into a committee to see whether we cannot give either, because we cannot give both. These are two very different points in this question. Gentlemen speak as if they thought none but members of the church of England were capable of sitting in parliament. But do not dissenters sit in this house? However, in point of doctrine, the church of England differs from the catholics, yet it does not differ more than from the dissenters. With regard to the maintenance and establishment of the church of England, there cannot be more difference between the catholics, than there is between the dissenters and the churchmen. We have forty-five members in this house, who are of a professed establishment different from our own, and they are not members of the most tolerant sect. It is true, that from the bias of their intellectual attainments, from the improvement of their minds, and from their enlightened understanding, they are above narrow religious prejudices; yet from the profession of their faith, they are not more liberal or tolerant than the Roman catholics. The Roman catholics are charged with saying, there is no salvation for heretics, and the Scots kirk says, it is blasphemy to assert that any can be saved who are not of their faith. Out of these forty-five members, not more than three or four could be persuaded to decide with us in favour of the repeal of the test act. It is said, how can we employ persons in office who are not of the established religion. In Ireland they are acceptable, because there is no test act. If it is said that We want to put the catholics in a better situation than the dissenters, let it be recollected that we are talking of Ireland. But is it supposed that the test act is the means of assuring that every man shall be member of the church of England? Do we not know, that in the reign of queen Anne, bills of occasional conformity were passed; and that in the reign of George I many of the dissenters only took the sacrament to shew their disposition in favour of the established church, however they might not agree as to parts of the liturgy? Will any body say that taking the sacrament proves a man to be a supporter of the church of England? May not a dissenter take the sacrament, and yet consider the liturgy of the church of England as the most consummate bigotry? This leads me to another part of subject, which was stated by a right hon. and learned gent.(Sir W. Scott), who, I flatter myself, I may call my friend. The1058principle flower of his eloquence consisted in the repetition of the word \"must.\" He seemed to think, that the fundamental laws of the church of England \"must\" be repealed by granting the prayer of the catholics. The exclusion of the catholics from seats in parliament, and the existence of the test acts, are the props, according to the right hon. and learned gent., which support the church of England. What, then, was the state of the church of England in the reigns of Elizabeth, of James the first, and Charles the first? Were those princes not the heads of the church as effectually as his present majesty; nay, would it not be deemed the grossest abomination to doubt, even, that Charles, the first fell a martyr,to the church of England? Yet, throughout the reigns of these princes, Roman catholics sat in parliament, and the test act had no existence. Granting the thirty-nine articles of the church of England to be not repugnant to the free principles of the constitution as established in the reign of king William; yet the homilies which follow are by many stated to be an absolute condemnation of the very thing which took place at the time of the revolution. Nay, did not Sacheverel openly attack, and upon the authority of these homilies, stigmatise that great proceeding as impious, and utterly destructive of the church of England?&#x2014; Now, with regard to those learned places which form a repository for the essential doctrines of religion, I mean the universities, in one of which (the university of Oxford) I had the honour to receive part of my early education, if I was to produce the decree of that university of 1688, against limited government, describing it as one of those things which lead to atheism, what would be said of it? Some of the best of men have come from that university. None more so than the right hon. and learned gent; but I do beg, to use a plain homely phrase, that they will not throw stones whose windows are made of glass I do not advise the high church party to look so narrowly into the history of the catholics, and into all the violence of their decrees, in order to disqualify them from being amalgamated and reconciled to the constitution of this country. It has been said by an hon. and learned gent., that the Roman catholics wish to overturn the established religion of this country. To this I answer, that there are good subjects of all sects and persuasions, in all countries, who dissenting from the established religion, yet pay obedience to the opin-1059ion of the majority. I am surprised it should have been said by an hon. and learned gent., (the attorney general) that if he was a catholic in a country where the protestant church was established, and he had the power, he would exercise it to weaken the established religious government. I have too good an opinion to think so of him. If every man was to conceive himself at liberty, because he differed from the established religion of a country, to attempt to overturn it, the general tendency of such a principle would be to destroy all peace in the world. I do not believe any good catholic would so act; I am sure no good subject, who loves his country, ought so to act. The question is this. Here are persons who apply to you, not for exclusive privileges, but simply to be placed on a footing with all the other of his majesty's subjects. It is a claim of justice. If you refuse it, the burthen of proof lies on you, to shew the inconvenience or danger of granting their claim. Nothing of the sort has been proved; you have argued it only by referring to old times, differing from the present. The question comes to this, whether, in the state in which we are, it can be the conduct of a wise and prudent government to separate from itself so large a proportion of the population of the country as the people of Ireland? No statesman, no man Who can judge of the affairs of the world, will think so. I should. hope that those who wish well to the country, will support my motion. If it should however unfortunately fail, we shall all have done our duty in arguing the question, with a view to induce those to adopt our opinion, who are at present under a fatal delusion with regard to this momentous subject. I should notice one thing; it is, that you have raised this question, and not the petition. The petition has nothing of the seeds of turbulence in it. You will, I trust, draw the hopes Of Ireland to this country, make the people of Ireland look to us as their best reliance, and prevent their recurring to any criminal measures.&#x2014;I should now sit down, but for the observation of an hon. baronet (sir W. Dolben). He says, why should you give all this to the catholics of Ireland, and not grant the same to the catholics of Eng-1060land? In the first place, the catholics of England have not petitioned. I have no doubt as to the propriety of putting the catholics of England on the same footing. I have no doubt they would finally obtain the same privileges. Those who know the .catholics of England, who know the character of the lower ranks of the people, are sensible how little danger would result from the catholic peers sitting in the house of lords, or catholic members in the house of commons. Every man must perceive that it would be beneficial to the country, particularly at a time when every man is called upon to shew his zeal in the service, and in the general cause of the empire. I have only to add, in answer to an hon. gent. opposite, that I was in Ireland a great while ago; but it did not appear to me that the condition of the country was calculated to reconcile gentlemen who visited it, to its general laws. The gentlemen of Ireland ought to be listened to With very considerable attention. From what I have seen in the course of this debate, I think I shall find, on the division, that I shall have the honour of dividing with more of the gentlemen of that country, than ever I had on any former occasion. I believe it will be. long before the speeches we have heard from them will be forgotten. The question is important in the highest degree.

Whatever communication the right hon. gent. had to make, he thought it would come with more propriety after the motion. He apprehended that if he had made a motion on the morning after the night the resolutions were proposed and acquiesced in, that lord Melville should have been dismissed from his offices and his majesty's councils and presence, that there would not have been one dissentient voice. He apprehended, that if lord Melville had not been a member of the house of peers, but merely of Me house of commons, and he had moved for the dismissal of him as a member of the house of commons, that there would not have been a dissentient voice. In the course of this business he had shaped his conduct so as to obtain the suffrages and support of every independent member of parliament; and, in so doing; he conceived he had strictly conformed to his duty, and promoted the welfare of the public. The second day after the resolutions passed, he had moved an address to his majesty, that lord Melville should be. removed from his councils and presence, and deprived of all offices held by him under the crown. It appeared on that occasion to have been the sense of the house, that it would be better the resolutions should he carried to the foot of the throne; but he was of opinion the consequence of that measure was not precisely what would have taken place if the house had gone up with the address. The consequences he had hoped for. had not taken place. He had resigned his office at the admiralty, but his name had not been struck out of the list of the privy council. The right hon. gent. who had just intimated that he had some602communication to make, had not only said on a former day that his name was not struck off the privy council book, but that he saw no reason for advising his majesty to erase it. Under these circumstances, a committee had been appointed to examine further into the matters of the tenth report, as exclusively as could be of the conduct of lord Melville, and a civil prosecution had been ordered against his lordship and Mr. Trotter. A right hon. gent. had proposed, that it should be turned into a criminal prosecution. In this situation the country stood&#x2014;that the house had decided that lord Melville, not accidentally or once, but during the course of a long administration, had been guilty of a breach of his duty, and a gross violation of the law, and yet no punishment had been inflicted in consequence of this decision. He knew it had been contended that lord Melville had been punished, and appeals had been made to the house whether the punishment had not been sufficiently severe. He could not easily forget the impressive words of a right hon. gent. (the master of the rolls) over against him, or his feelings and countenance, compelling sympathy, when he asked whether lord Melville had not been sufficiently punished? He wished he could borrow a little of that right hon. gent.'s accuracy of expression to call upon the house to perform what, if it did not perform, he should contend lord Melville would not be punished. if humiliation; if voluntary degradation; if the resignation of high employments under the crown, such as lord Melville thought himself capable of filling; if the feelings of a man who had held great official situations for many years; if a broken and contrite heart,h&#x0153; flamm&#x0153; h&#x0153; fnsce&#x2014;if these were to be considered a punishment, then it was possible lord Melville might have been punished sufficiently. In that case, his punishment was as far superior to any the house could inflict, as the hand that inflicted it was above the power of mortals. It was the duty of the house to take care that others were not betrayed into the same errors, and that men in the situaation of lord Melville should know, that if they acted as he had done they would subject themselves to degradation. It was also incumbent on the house to take care that equal justice was done to all, and that when others were writhing under punishment, delinquents of greater magnitude were not spared. The sensations of shame were not confined to men in high stations; but a603common clerk, detected in a fraudulent act, felt equally with the highest peer: his feelings, too, were accompanied with the loss of character, and the loss of character was attended with, the loss of bread. With regard to such a person, it highly probable that even if the law was not followed up, that his wife, children, relatives, and dependants, would be reduced to a state of misery. Such an accumulation of distress was of itself punishment enough; but justice and the law must have their victim. He therefore, in the name of minor delinquents, in the name of the public, in the name of the representative body of England, and in the name of the former vote of the house, called for that which was but bare simple justice on lord Melville. He deprecated the injury the character of the parliament of 1805 would sustain, if, after the detection of lord Melville's guilt, it should appear that parliament had stopped in its punishment, and that he had been suffered to remain a privy counsellor, particularly after the proofs against him had been so complete; when instead of any denial of the charge by lord Melville,habemus confitentem reum, he had given evidence against himself. He proceeded to infer the odium it would cast on the ministers of the day if it should appear they had endeavoured to protect such a delinquent. He highly censured that advice which had dictated the answer of his majesty. to the sheriff of London, when they waited upon his majesty with the address of the common council. After a few further observation, he moved, that his majesty's answer should be taken into consideration; observing, that he meant afterwards to move an address to his majesty, praying him to order the name of lord Melville to be erased from the privy council, and to dismiss him I from his presence for ever.", "author_id": "/people/mr-samuel-whitbread-2", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

At all events, sir, we have reason to rejoice in the triumph which justice has experienced, when we consider that they were compelled at length to give this advice who were for protecting lord Melville, because he was \"an old and faithful servant of the crown,\" and had only acted contrary to the intention of the act of parliament! Why was this advice not given immediately after the address of the 10th of April, for which the right hon. gent. expresses such profound veneration? He comments upon this address, and considers it merely as an606official notice to his majesty of the proceedings of the house. So it was; but why was it thought proper to give such A notice? Surely, sir, for the purpose that ministers might take such measures, as they might not be so strictly bound to take, if the notice had not been given. This, sir, was understood, and strongly urged et the time. But if the right hon. gent. then understood the sense of the. house in such a manner that he did not think it his duty to advise the erasing of lord Melville's name from the list of privy counsellors, how comes it that he has now given that advice? How has he since collected the general opinion of the house in a way to induce him to alter his sentiments so materially? But he says, that he has canvassed the opinions of several individual members. Sir, there seems to be, strong grounds to suppose that this is a compromise adopted in consequence of a ministerial intrigue, rather than an act implying any deference to the opinions of this house. I do not know that however. I am only in possession of what the public in general know on the subject.&#x2014;Now, sir, one word as to the time. The right hon. gent. takes the last moment for giving this advice, in order, as far as possible, to divert the censure of this house from lord Melville. Notice was given of the proposition, the very first day, I believe, that the business came before the house. Allusions to it had been made in subsequent proceedings; but it is not till within half an hour of. its being brought forward, that the right hon. gent. comes down and makes this communication, from the well founded terror, that if he permitted the question to go to a division, he would be left in a minority. But is it now precisely the same thing as if it had. been done long before? Does it not show clearly, that every thing within the compass of possibility is to be done in favour of lord Melville? First, it was maintained that he only acted contrary to theintentionof the law: then he was permitted to resign his office of first lord of the admiralty, to prevent his being turned out. And now at last, when nothing can be done to prevent it, he is erased from the privy council. The difference between its being done now and done before is, I acknowledge, as far as the public are concerned, not very material; but it will be recollected, that the right hon. gent. held out till he could hold out no longer without a certainty of being beat. I trust, however, that things will now607speedily be finished, however tardily they may have been begun, that the house will follow up the public opinion, and that every Measure will be taken that can afford security the people, not by making legislative provisions for the future, for these may be disregarded, as they have been already, but by inflicting proper punishment where it is deserved. This triumph has not been willingly gained, but has been extorted by the sole consideration that a majority would oppose lord Melville if he was further defended. I can assure the house that there is every symptom of the country being seriously agitated, and that it will not readily place much confidence in those who have exerted themselves so much to screen a delinquent, though they have at last been obliged, to give him up.", "author_id": "/people/mr-charles-fox-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

On the contrary, the hon. gent. was heard to glory in his own dismissal and that of another person, from the list of his majesty's council, and to state his hope that that would not by any part of the public be considered a disgrace. Was not this then pretty clearly to express an opinion, that it was not his desire to produce that effect which had been communicated to the house, with regard to lord Melville, whom it was so much the study of the hon. gent. to degrade? The house, however, witnessed the hon. gent.'s conduct, and it was for them to judge whether it sprung at, all from a love of public equity, or was influenced by any feeling of humanity. It had been stated that the noble lord was guilty of public plunder, and therefore incapable of those feelings which would entitle a man to compassion. But he most positively denied that any such guilt could be ascribed to him. That he had connived at the misconduct of Trotter, he was ready to admit, but that he had participated of any of the emoluments resulting from that misconduct he ever should contradict. Nothing had appeared before the house to justify the charge of lord Melville's having joined in public robbery, and if any gentleman should assert such a thing, he was prepared to meet him. With respect to the hon. gent.'s professed desire to punish and prevent peculation, and the improper use of the public money, the house and the country must recollect enough to he enabled to judge of the sincerity of his professions. For need it be told, that from the year 1765 to the year 1782, lord Holland derived, to his own private profit, an interest of 15,000l. per annum from the use of the public money, as paymaster of the army, and that not one farthing of this money had ever since been paid [a loud cry of Order, Order! but still the right hon. gent. proceeded]. Was not the hon. gent. aware, when he was indulging himself in what he termed speculations, but what was commonly called gambling, that he was squandering the property609of the public? Did he not know that the peculations of lord Holland furnished him with the means of defraying the extravagancies of early life?

{"date": ["1805", "may", "06"], "content": "&#x2014;As the right hon. gent. has thought proper to make such a pointed allusion to the conduct of my father, I hope for the indulgence of the house while I submit a few observations. For although a considerable time has elapsed since the death of the person to whom the right hon. gent. alludes, I cannot but feel a high interest in any thing that concerns his reputation. What the right hon. gent. could mean by calling him to my recollection in this instance, unless to create an uneasiness in my breast, I am at a loss to imagine. For how does the case of my father apply to that of lord Melville? The case of lord Holland is as clear as light. There was no law to forbid the paymaster of the army to apply the balances remaining in his hands to any purpose of private emolument, in the way described at the time lord Holland held that office. Taking the fact as it stands, if, as the right hon. gent. alleges, it was criminal in a public officer to make use of the public money for his own private profit, when there was no act of parliament against it,&#x00E0; fortiori, it was still more criminal after the act had passed. The difference between the case of lord Holland and lord Melville is this, that the conduct of the former was not against law, while that of the other was in the very teeth of a law proposed by himself. What then does the right hon. gent. gain by the reference? That the practice which obtained in the office of the paymaster of the army was generally right, I am not now going to argue. But I do remember, and it must be in the recollection of the house, that at the time the practice was under discussion, very different opinions prevailed among the most eminent lawyers in the country upon this question, whether the paymasters were accountable to the public for the interest arising out of the balances remaining in their hands. I know that the negative of this proposition was maintained by many persons of high consideration, but most certainly the weight of eminence and authority was on the other side. For it was held that the balances were not the property of the610public, but that of the public creditors. This question was repeatedly discussed in this house, under various administrations. I will not mention that of the marquis of Rockingham, because that ministry might be supposed to have some regard for me&#x2014;but it was very fully canvassed during the ad. ministration of lord North, when, indeed, no such supposition of favour could exist. And what was the result?&#x2014;why, that a committee appointed to consider the case reported that the practice referred to Was regarded as a privilege belonging to the office of paymaster of the army, and that it had universally prevailed with those, who held that office, with the exception of the father of the gentleman over against me (lord Chatham) and perhaps another. If it were deemed a criminal practice, no doubt some measure of prosecution would have been instituted. But the feeling was different. Nay, the house so felt it, and evinced its sentiment afterwards by granting an increase of the salary attached to the office, in lieu of such privilege. That sentiment was decidedly expressed in the resolution of the committee, upon which the salary of lord Melville, as treasurer of the navy, was augmented in order to compensate for the loss of the emoluments resulting from the use of the public balances, which from the period of that augmentation ,was entirely to cease. Recollecting, therefore, that the practice of which the right hon. gent. has accused my father did prevail among the paymasters of the army up to the time at which the salary of these officers was increased at the appointment of Mr. Burke and Mr. Barr&#x00E9;, I cannot see any analogy between the case of lord Holland and lord Melville. With respect to the allusion which the right hon. gent. has made to my conduct in early life, I have to be sure, as the right hon. gent. terms it, gambled a good deal. I also feel that I continued that practice much too long, and lost a considerable sum of money. My father, no doubt, left me a large fortune but how the right hon. gent. can infer that my manner of spending that fortune can afford any proof of my connivance, in what he considers my father's improper manner of obtaining it&#x2014;or that I was a party to the misappropiation of\n            public money, I leave it to the house to conjecture. That those who are the relative, or who have had the misfortune of being in any degree connected with lord Melville, should feel affected by the disgrace611into which he has fallen, is, I admit, very natural; but yet I think that such feelings should not be suffered to stand in the way of a great public duty&#x2014;and certainly it would be much more delicate not at all to express them in this house. I shall now say no more than to observe, that if it were the object of the right hon. gent. to wound my feelings, he has entirely failed, and to repeat, that if he had succeeded in fixing the imputation of guilt on the conduct of My father, that success would only tend to aggravate the guilt of lord Melville.", "author_id": "/people/mr-charles-fox-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

It is, I conceive, impossible they could have come to these conclusions had they adverted to the whole of the evidence laid before them, and since submitted to the house: part of that evidence, highly material in itself, has passed unnoticed: other parts will be found in direct contradiction with their report.&#x2014;The individual conduct of a member of this house, on any subject in which the public interest is concerned, needs no apology: but if I wanted one for the part I think it my indispensable duty to take on this occasion, I should feel myself entitled to the indulgence of this house when defending the interest of the house of Keys of the Isle of Man, acting under an unanimous vote; the interest of 1300 respectable land-owners of that island, whose petition lies on your table, and of 30,000 unr&#x00E9;presented persons, its inhabitants, whose interests must materially suffer were the measure his grace of Atholl seeks to carry, unfortunately for them, to receive the sanction of parliament.&#x2014;It is obvious how sincere must be the wish, how greatly it would be the interest, of the inhabitants, to stand on fair terms with time noble petitioner: to oppose his wishes must be matter of sincere regret to them, and nothing but the strictest sense of duty could induce the house of Keys, or the people, to give211opposition to those wishes.&#x2014;No interest of a private nature have they, sir, or have I, in opposing the present claim&#x2014;and I trust we shall hear no more of rumours which have circulated, that the opposition to this measure arises in prejudice, or in motives of a personal nature.&#x2014;To put the house fully in possession of the present case, it is necessary to call their attention to certain previous transactions now known but to few. Of these transactions, but for particular connexions, and the circumstances that have led my attention to the subject, I should, like others, have remained ignorant.&#x2014;In 1774, the present noble claimant entered on the possession of the island.&#x2014;In 1780, a petition, appears, to have been presented by him to this house, complaining of injury sustained in consequence of the act by Which this island was vested in his majesty.&#x2014;It seems to have been the design of the noble petitioner to get back certain objects, unnecessarily, as he maintained, and unintentionally, taken from his family. Of these the value did not, I believe, amount to 300l. a year. But this petition had further objects; as to the creation of courts independent of the sovereign (the judges of which his grace sought to have the nomination of himself), and many other feudal and manerial regulations. On this petition a bill was founded. Considerable alarm was excited in the island. By the direction of the treasury, references took place to the attorney and solicitor general of the day; earl Rosslyn, then Mr. Wedderburne, and Mr. Wallace, names high in estimation; and also to the insular attorney-general, sir Wadsworth Busk (a man to whose honour, integrity, and ability, all who know him can with me bear witness), and to the other crown officers of the island. Their several reports were highly unfavourable to his grace's then objects, and the bill was laid to rest.&#x2014;In the following year it re-appeared: again it was referred to the succeeding attorney and solicitor general, Mr. Wallace, and the now chief justice Mansfield: and again the report was unfavourable.&#x2014;The same bill, however, little to the credit of this house, was suffered to pass to the lords. There the house of Keys opposed it, and on the second reading it was withdrawn. Its fate, sir, I now regret: had it been stripped of its obnoxious clauses as to game, manerial courts, &c.; the objects his grace sought of a pecuniary nature might perhaps have met with little212opposition: the bill might have passed into a law, and we, probably, have been saved the mortification of witnessing and the island of contending against still more extraordinary measures which have followed it; the last of which we are now considering.&#x2014;In 1783 a petition, pointing in nearly the same terms at the same objects, again appears on your journals: but I do not observe that any further steps were taken upon it.&#x2014;Now, in these three several applications made to this house, what distinctly appears to have been the object sought by his grace? To explain and amend that very act, of the operation and effects of which he is still complaining: to raise objections to and seek relief against injurious consequences resulting, as he asserts, from that measure. &#x2014; And what says his grace of inadequacy of compensation? of the incompetence of parliament to legislate for his island? of force or threats used to compel the proprietors to part with it? Was the inalienability of this property then urged as a foundation for any claim, or for the revision of the transaction? On these topics not one word is said.&#x2014;Recollect, sir, his grace had been six years in peaceable possession of this fair domain; that he had attained the age of from five to eight and twenty; that he had, apparently, most diligently looked into his titles, and obtained the most accurate information and advice. Can it then be endured that he shall at this day contend he is dissatisfied with the price, or the mode on which his family parted with the property? The objects he now seeks might then more reasonably have been urged, and would have been urged, had his grace conceived any such claims to have existed. I do not accuse the noble duke of putting forward this bill of 1780, as a prelude to others; that he meant to employ it as a step-ladder to his other claims. I do not impute to him such disingenuousness. No, sir, I affirm that his grace must have been, as he now ought to be, well content with a compact so beneficial to his family and himself, however he might complain of incidental stipulations in it.&#x2014;But I am not left to inference and conjecture as to his grace's then sentiments on the bargain made in 1765. I have the best authority on that subject to produce, namely that of his grace himself. If I am to blame for he opinion I form, the noble duke has been the person to mislead me. Here is his bill. He states, \"that the so-213vereignty, ports, and commerce were no otherwise required to be revested in the crown than as they interfered with revenue; and, considering the liberality with Which the said treaty was conducted, it was meant the reservations should be full secured to his family.\" Now, can it be possible that he who uses these words can pretend he was dissatisfied, that the bargain was void or compulsive, or even harsh! These transactions occupy three years: can it be supposed that the opinion here avowed was lightly held or inconsiderately expressed! No, sir, I rely on it as incontestable proof, that there was no opinion then entertained by him or his family, that the bargain was other than beneficial.&#x2014;In 1790, I do admit, that opinion appears changed. Twenty-five years after the transaction are disclosed the first symptoms of discontent on the part of the noble duke; for that period of time he and his family had been in the enjoyment of those advantages which the compact with government secured to them. Then it first occurred to him to advance a claim of addition to that price, which appears to others not merely adequate but most liberal.&#x2014;To account for this change of sentiment is not difficult. Between the first petition in 1780, and that of 1790 which we now have in view, considerable addition had been made by parliament to the insular customs; their gross produce in 1780 was but 3,200l.; in 1790, it approached, within a few pounds, to 7,000l.&#x2014;Here then, sir, is the source of his grace'sdissatisfaction. Here the grounds of his present hopes offurther compensation!&#x2014;After glancing, then, at this new discovery of the compensation paid twenty-five years previously, being inadequate, the petition asks the appointment of commissioners to enquire into the nature and value of the rights and species of property necessary to remain vested in the crown for the security of the public revenue, and as to the injury alledged to be done to the petitioner's remaining interest.&#x2014;How modest and humble this request! How great the contrast with the petition of the present day! such as it was, however, his grace utterly failing in making out any case, the decided hostility of the house to the principle sought to be established, induced the right hon. gent. opposite me to withdraw the bill.&#x2014;In the following year commissioners were sent, under the authority of the king, to institute these enquiries on214the spot. And here I desire to do justice to the selection made; there were on that commission men of the highest character for candour, abilities, and integrity. With the result of their labours, the island, as well as his grace, had reason to express, and each expresses, perfect satisfaction.&#x2014;Here, then, it would naturally have been expected that every litigated object, every dormant claim, every possible subject of dispute, would have been brought forward, canvassed, and sifted to the bottom. Serious cause of complaint have I, sir, against the noble claimant, that when this opportunity offered of discussing a most prominent object in this report, from that discussion he shrunk. Had he then urged that monstrous claim on which the committee and his grace's other friends have so much dwelt, of a despotic power in the lord to impose on commerce what taxes he pleased, he could not have found a person competent to speak on the subject, who would not have witnessed against his claim, and to the reputation of the right being in the whole legislative body. This claim of arbitrary power in the lord proprietor, to ransom his vassals at discretion, with no limit but his moderation and their ability, would have met in the island with neither friend nor supporter.&#x2014;Is it just, is it even decent, sir, to decide a subject so grave and momentous as this, without hearing the whole of the evidence; without giving to the house of Keys an opportunity, before some legal tribunal, of being heard? This body derives its origin from the remotest periods of antiquity: it is perhaps the only Celtic institution remaining upon earth. The insular records go back four centuries. At their commencement the house of Keys existed; but how long anterior it existed under the same appellation, is unknown. Before the revestment, the power of legislation, in all cases whatsoever, they claimed and possessed in union with the lord-proprietor and his council. The mode of election into that house certainly I shall not defend. But however objectionable in theory, no instance whatever of their abuse of power can be adduced. More faithful guardians of the people's rights could not have been found. In every dispute with the lord they have ever steadily been found on the side of the people. When these commissioners were pursuing their enquiries in the island, there were members of the Keys, and other persons then living, whose memory could go back215half a century or upward, who could have stated the traditions of this subject, and explained difficulties, if any there were. To such sort of evidence his grace did not think fit to resort. The merit of this discovery was reserved for the labour and diligent researches of this committee.&#x2014;However valuable the report made, and the evidence collected by these commissioners of enquiry, little good has yet resulted. There lies their report; and the most important suggestions of improvement they have offered, sleep with it.&#x2014;From 1790, the date of his grace's last application to parliament, he appears to have given these poor islanders a long respite. Not till 1801 do we hear again of his claims. In that year comes his petition to the privy council.&#x2014;The course of proceedings on that first petition, deserve attention and applause. As often as the conduct of the administration of that day comes under consideration, so often will it demand my warm approbation. It was an administration in which the public purse was husbanded; but at the same time that it was a government of less cost, it was, in my opinion, one of more vigour than the present.&#x2014;The then minister, combining a just regard to the claims of an individual with the duty he owed the public, sent those claims for investigation to the attorney and solicitor-general. Their report is in all hands. It is the most satisfactory discussion of a mixed matter of law and fact that ever came under my consideration.&#x2014;One of the subscribers of that report now fills a more elevated situation; from what we saw of him, when a member of this house, we are all, I trust, convinced that he will execute the duties of that station with honour to himself and advantage to his country. The other subscriber I sincerely regret, sir, not having the satisfaction of seeing this night in his place, but we all know him to be a man too honourable to permit me to reason from his report, if he had changed the opinions on which it is founded.&#x2014;Able and masterly as that report is, it cannot but produce conviction with every man who brings an unprejudiced mind to its perusal.&#x2014;Not so, it seems, thought the present claimant. To the attorney and solicitor general his grace himself replies! This is not, I presume, very usual his memorial was however accepted; and the privy council proceeded to deliberate and consider the case.&#x2014;They came to a decision, and made216a minute of council.&#x2014;It was not without difficulty we succeeded in bringing before the house this valuable document: it negatives, most completely, his grace's claims.&#x2014; The next step to which the noble claimant resorts is to suggest to the privy council, that he had still another supplemental petition to present, containing new matter of importance.&#x2014;The same principle of equity and moderation which characterised that administration, influenced it to suspend the report till this further evidence was produced.&#x2014;Then comes a most material and fortunate occurrence for the noble duke&#x2014;a change of administration! Mark the difference of their conduct. On this supplementary petition of the duke of Atholl, which turns out to contain not one single fact that can weigh a feather in the scale; without reference, as before, to the attorney and solicitor general; without giving them an opportunity of investigating the contents of this precious supplementary paper; of defending or abandoning their former opinion; the privy-council come to a report in direct opposition to the former, ratifying his grace's claims, and recommending the compensation being granted on the insular revenues; employing in this investigation not many more days than the preceding administration had done years.&#x2014; On this report the present proceedings are founded.&#x2014;Before I proceed, sir, to the consideration of the subject of the report of this committee, I must enter my solemn protest against the policy of the present measure. We are reversing the very purpose and principle of legislation: setting property afloat; rendering bargains insecure. Nothing but positive proof of violence or fraud could justify parliament in entertaining such a measure. It must hereafter be uncertain up to what period possession may be considered as a bar against claims that may be advanced for further compensation. It is not for us, after the lapse of forty years, to examine whether the sale on the part of this family was provident or improvident. Were time no bar, we are precluded from entering into that enquiry by his grace of Atholl's own avowal at the commencement of his career, of the liberality with which the treaty was conducted. If the principle be admitted, that the increased value, in the course of forty years, of any one object whatever sold, be it to the public or to an individual, affords a fit and just claim for the seller's demanding an addition to his price,217then, sir, there is an end to the security of property.&#x2014;To this measure in particular, sir, I object, because we have now but one party in our view. We consider it but with relation to the individual. The interests of the public, the injuries which provoked the servants of the crown to resort to the measures that were supposed to have led to the sale of the island, are now forgotten and unknown. Those who are now guardians of the public purse, no longer feel that sense of duty which impelled the illustrious minister of that day to act as he did in putting down that nuisance. We are now discussing this question as if against an innocent person; as if the country had no cause of complaint against his noble predecessors. It is scarce in recollection, that a yearly sum of 350,000l. was asserted to be lost to the revenue. If this was true, in ten years the public must have sustained an injury of three millions and a half of money. But certain it is, a gain had accrued to the proprietor of at least 50,000l. beyond his fair legal revenue.&#x2014;It is quite immaterial to me whether all this was done with or without his knowledge; he might, and ought not only to have known, but to have prevented it. His duty, as a good subject, forbad his being accessory to a violation of the laws of the parent-country.&#x2014;Why should not the descendants of the dukes of Richmond and Grafton, or various others, demand a review of their contracts? If the country proceeds in a progressive state of improvement, there will be a greater disproportion in forty years between the amount of the revenue they sold, than there is in the present instance; but with this material difference, that what they sold was their right. That which is now claimed springs from what the duke of Atholl had not to sell; and from improvements resulting from British trade, and marks industry.&#x2014;To come then to this report, which seems to me to rest on four allegations: 1st, Precipitancy in carrying into execution the agreement. 2d, Inalienability in the objects conveyed. 3d, Incompetency in parliament to legislate for the Isle of Man. 4th, The notable discovery, recently made, of uncontrollable, despotic power in the fedual proprietor of the Isle of Man; of an absolute monarch created by a limited one. On the first head, this alledged precipitancy. If the charge be not founded on an arraignment of the usual form of proceeding in parliamnt, it appears com-218pletely unfounded.&#x2014;More time than usual, indeed, appears to have been given. It was the noble personages' own fault if they had not more discussion as well before this, as another branch of the legislature.&#x2014;But were I to couple the charge his grace makes of hurry and precipitance at one time, with the admission he makes of perfect liberality at another, this charge might be converted into an argument for defalcation, instead of increase of the price he has received.&#x2014;On the next head, of inalienability, and some supposed defective formalities; as I have not received a legal education, it would ill become me to say a word. The house may probably hear from those who have had that advantage, opinions little according with his grace's. I have, indeed, been informed, that besides the sovereignty alienated to the crown, the family have, from time to time, parted with tithes, and other heads of property. These titles are held perfectly safe, and never have been assailed by the duke of Atholl.&#x2014;But exercising only one's common sense on this allegation, how perfectly irreconcileable it is with the present attempt! his grace of Atholl asks more money. Why? because what he brings to market cannot be sold; because he can take no price for it; because it must be his and his family's property to the end of time. Excellent reasons these for restoring, but the worst possible for further compensating. It is a claim that money cannot satisly.&#x2014;But did he come to parliament on his first, second, or third application, with this allegation? Had he so done, it might have afforded fit matter for examination. This is neither the place, nor the time for fresh investigations. I am convinced, indeed, it is not wished we should look into them. This and the former allegation are merely thrown out as help to amuse those who do not examine minutely.&#x2014;They have no bearing whatever on the question of further compensation.&#x2014;On the next head of the alledged incompetency of parliament to legislate for the Isle of Man, I shall not presume to offer any opinion of my own, armed as I am by the attorney and solicitor general of England with the opinions of lord Coke, and Mr. justice Blackstone; I cannot but agree with them in thinking it a question on which no doubt can be entertained. By lord Coke it has been held that by special name an act of parliament \"may extend to the Isle of Man;\" and sir W. Blackstone219adds, \"that this right has not rested in theory, but has been frequently acted on in parliament.\" To the instances cited by the attorney and solicitor-general, I beg leave, however, to add another, even somewhat prior in time, to any adduced by them: this is the 33d Henry VIII. called \"The bill for Cross-Bows and Hand-Guns;\" which imposes penalties on the use of weapons of certain descriptions. Amongst other places the Isles of Wight and Man are exempted; provided these weapons are not used against deer, and other enumerated animals.&#x2014;If so used, the penalties clearly attached: here therefore, distinctly appears an act of interior domestic legislation for the Isle of Man.&#x2014;The 5th of Elizabeth, c. 5th, affords an instance of the exercise of the very power repeated in that act of the 5th of the king, chap. 39, which the duke of Atholl and his committee affect to term the mischiefact.&#x2014;French wines are forbidden to be imported into the realm of England, or any part of the same, except in English vessels: two exceptions are admitted; of Rochelle wines into Wales; into the Isle of Man, of 100 ton of French wines at the most. For the queen's duties on these excepted wines, express provision is made.&#x2014;It is evident that the Isle of Man, and Wales, are here considered in the same point of view, as members of the realm of England; that, it was equally competent to parliament to legislate for the one as for the other; and that the importation of more than 100 ton of French wine by foreigners, was therefore illegal.&#x2014;The 7th of Geo. I, prohibiting the importation into the Isle of Man of East-India goods, except from great Britain, important as it is in every point of view, has wholly escaped the, attention of this committee.&#x2014;In that act we see another legislative measure, directly affecting the commerce of the island.&#x2014;The 12th Geo. I, forbids the importation from the Isle of Man, into great Britain or Ireland, of any goods not its own produce, and inflicts the penalty of forfeiture, as well of the goods, as of the ship conveying them, superadding fine or imprisonment on the persons concerned in the landing. This statute also authorizes the treasury to treat with the proprietors for their claims over these regalities.&#x2014;The act passed in the next reign, imposing on the seamen of the island the payment of Greenwich-Hospital money, and authorizing the collection of it by the servants of220the crown within the island, is equally decisive. \"Abundantly sufficient,\" we may well conclude with the attorney and solicitor general, they are to show that parliament has, in fact, again and again, exercised that right of legislation which lord Coke and sir W. Blackstone so justly attribute to it: Here is both theory and practice. Nor has it ever been disputed by the inhabitants of the island, or by any person, or at any time that I have heard, except on the present occasion, by the noble claimant.&#x2014;If ever the time was when the competence of parliament on this head, if unfounded, should have been disputed, it was in 1765, when the act for putting down smuggling was proposed.&#x2014;The noble proprietors then petitioned against it. A most eloquent speech, of which the memory still lives in tradition, and has been perpetuated by the press, was then delivered; a case on behalf of the petitioners, of which a copy is now in my hand, was then printed. Does any one of these documents breathe the slightest doubt as to the power of parliament?&#x2014; At that period the proprietors had also the benefit of the professional assistance of another most eminent advocate, Mr. Madocks. But above all, they were aided by one whose judgment and sagacity are known wherever our tongue is spoken, by one of the greatest statesmen and lawyers the country ever produced, in short, by lord Mansfield. Is it possible that this argument, if maintainable, could have escaped his penetrating mind: that it would not have been urged with equal force and more effect than any adduced by the advocates acting for the noble petitioners.&#x2014;Before I advert to the last claim this report states on behalf of the noble duke, of the power of arbitrary taxation existing in the feudal proprietor, I beg leave again to refer to the same valuable document, containing the case submitted to this house in 1765, by those proprietors.&#x2014;Many years ago I discovered it by accident among the papers of a deceased parent. Little could I then dream, that I was this day to produce it as containing a complete refutation of this despotic claim; an unanswerable proof of the right of co-legislation enjoyed by the house of Keys, of which I have the honour to be a member.&#x2014;The petitioners there state the insular government as composed of three estates: 1st, \"The lord, who bath ever retained the rights of the ancient kings in assenting or dissenting to the laws pro-221posed;\" 2d, \"In the governor and council;\" and 3d, \"the Keys, who are the representatives of the commons.&#x2014;Their triple concurrence makes the law.\" \"The laws of the island,\" the petitioners add, \"have established a book of rates.\"&#x2014;Now, sir, were I required to furnish a distinct, clear definition of the power of legislation as it then existed, I could not do better than refer to that prepared by the noble claimant's father. But I ask whether his statement be not as distinctly and clearly irreconcileable with the claim now advanced by this committee? Were further proofs required of the latter's claim being utterly unfounded in reason and in fact, those proofs are furnished by that very committee themselves.&#x2014;In the very first page of their printed proofs they state, from the report of the commissioners of enquiry, as an allegation of his grace, that his family had the power of increasing the duties, with the consent of the legislature.&#x2014;Next they state, in the third page, as collected from the whole of the evidence, that it is not probable that consent would have been given without an equivalent.&#x2014;Really, sir, I am at a loss to conceive how the claim of arbitrary taxation in the lord can, even in their own opinion, have one moment subsisted in contradiction to proofs so decisive as these.&#x2014;But, say the committee, \"they have not discovered, nor were they referred to, any other instance of the interference of the Keys, as to books of rates, or duties on importation or exportation,\" except one in 1736.&#x2014;Again I say, sir, I appeal to their own evidence. In page 42 they themselves insert an insular statute of 1734, imposing duties for 21 years on importation of arrack, equal in amount to the duty before payable; duties on all other spirits; on wines, coffee, tea, India goods, in short, on all foreign goods whatsoever, applicable to the repair of their harbours.&#x2014;This statute, sir, (which has of course the consent and signature of the Keys) I produce in particular, detached from the others, as being in point-blank contradiction to this most unguarded assertion of the committee, \"that they had not discovered or been referred to any other instance of the interference of the Keys as to duties on importations or exportations.\"&#x2014;The intervention of the Keys, as the committee still more broadly assert, was confined to matters of internal regulation, and assessments for local purposes.&#x2014; From their own evidence I will again, sir,222prove the direct contrary. It short, it is impossible, I must repeat, that the framers of this report can have, read the proofs on which they ought to have formed it.&#x2014;Before I look more. minutely into these proofs, part of which was laid before the committee by myself, I think it incumbent on me to notice the expression of surprise with which an hon. and learned bart. has been pleased to accompany his remarks on the part I took on this occasion; as if it were a private, ex parte transaction, in which my interference was improper.&#x2014;I have sat in this house nearly 20 years. On all transactions in which the public has an interest I have constantly thought it the duty of members of parliament to pay attention, and, if in their power, to afford information. This I have considered not merely as excusable, but as their duty. High as the authority may be of the hon. and learned bart. I shall require authority still higher than his before I forego this opinion, and this practice.&#x2014;In proof of the indubitable, and, till now, undisputed, right of the house of Keys to interfere in all matters of legislation without exception, I shall now proceed, sir, to call the attention of the house to the several acts of the insular legislature, termed acts of Tynwald, which the report of this committee lays before us.&#x2014;The first legislative act in order of time, of which a record now exists, is in 1417, within a few years after the grant from the crown to the Stanley family. By this act penalties are inflicted, or declared, against the receiving felons by certain inferior barons; or on persons concealing themselves within these petty jurisdictions. To to this act the Keys are,eo nomine,parties. Objections, I know, may be taken to the form of this instrument. Its style is that of \"indenture,\" but the effect and substance of it are clearly legislative: penalties are imposed by it on the subject. Allowance must be made for defects of form in barbarous times, where the rude and ignorant inhabitant possessed no other language than, his own dialect of the Celtic.&#x2014;Next, sir, I would beg to draw the attention of the house to the first book of insular rates, dated in 1577, which the committee asserts to have been made by the lord of the isle.&#x2014;Again, I say, sir, the direct contrary appears on their own showing. These rates appear, in their very front, to be but \"allowed and confirmed\" by Henry earl of Derby. How can a man allow and confirm his own act? Is it not most palpable223that this act must be tern act of others? that it was complete when presented to him for confirmation? It is not pretended that the lord was sole legislator on any other head but imposing port-duties. How is it possible he could be in this, when he himself, in the very first instance on record, claims to be, not imposer and maker, but merely as giving his allowance and confirmation?&#x2014;Safely as the case might here be left, I do [not leave it here. An assembly of the legislative power of the island is called once a year, or oftener, of which the Keys are constituent members. This is termed the court of Tynwald. Here all legislative acts are proclaimed; and until proclaimed, they are not received as law. Certain customs by the lord's commandment, put in writing by the Deemsters, appear to have been thus proclaimed on the 13th of July, 1577. Now, sir, I defy the noble claimant to show me one solitary instance of any law whatever, founded on the will of the lord, being thus proclaimed. A proclamation at a court of Tynwald, or of a court of Tynwald, must necessarily and essentially be of the acts of that court; the Keys were indispensably members of it: and, after careful research, I cannot find one instance of the lord, absolute as he endeavoured to make himself, though certainly never so absolute as is here pretended to have been, ever attempting to obtain the sanction of this solemn proclamation to his own mandates.&#x2014;Next, sir, I will point to the solution given of a doubt which appears to have arisen on the interpretation of this book of rates. A fee of one penny had been fixed by it for the entry of every boat; a dispute arises to whom the penny belonged. It is decided to belong to the captain's clerk. By whom decided? Why, by the Deemsters and Keys. Now, sir, I ask whether this does not most distinctly negative the assertion that the lord was the single maker of the rate? Would not litigating parties have resorted to the lord to expound what he had himself made? Would not the person whose claim was rejected by the Deemsters and Keys, have complained to the lord of their invasion of his prerogative? would the lord himself have acquiesced in that invasion?&#x2014;To my understanding, these circumstances, even separately, but taken together, most indisputably evince the very contrary of the committee's assertion, and prove the lord proprietor not to have made the rate in224question.&#x2014;In 1692, I am ready to admit, the lord proprietor, by his own and his council's authority, did innovate on this book of rates. The commissioners of enquiry warn us of similar strides of power having been attempted. They tell us of a few \"exceptions in which the commands of the lord proprietor, have been obtruded as laws on the people.\" Between these acts of power, and the constitutional laws of the country, I have already observed, there is this evident mark of distinction: the latter are invariably proclaimed as laws in a court of Tynwald: the former never were. The alteration made in the book of rates in 1692 never was: therefore, I say, it never was the law of the land.&#x2014;Gentleman speak of the house of Keys not having opposed this obnoxious measure. At this distance of time I know not the fact, whether they did or did not. But if not, even at this day motives of excuse for their forbearance may readily be imagined. These, sir, were day of calamity to the Isle of Man: they had other more important subjects of dispute with their lord. He had pressed forward claims to all their lands. The island was then deeply depressed in poverty, and it would have been imprudent to irritate the lord proprietor on a subject of comparatively, and at the moment, little importance to them. These duties were of trivial amount; paid by strangers; and it was not then foreseen how much, and by what means that amount was afterwards to be augmented.&#x2014;Even in 1706, it appears, sir, by an act of Tynwald, stated by the committee, that \"the poverty and mean circumstances of the people\" had prevented the payment of the lord's fines; and that to raise on the island an assessment of so small a sum as 1601. a delay of three years was necessarily given.&#x2014;Where then could the Keys have looked for the resources to enable them to enter into new contests with this powerful lord proprietor? They might be silent; but \"it was their poverty, not their will,\" consented.&#x2014;The motives, or length of time, of this acquiescence, are now of little moment. I shall convince the house, that the lord has solemnly renounced this supposed right. And renunciation of an assumed right proves ten times more strongly against the renouncer, that it was unfounded, than if he never had assumed it.&#x2014;An act of Tynwald of 1736, after stating, \"that the present book of rates had not hitherto had the consent225and concurrence of the 24 Keys,\" \"ordains, consents, and enacts by the authority aforesaid, that the rates modified and altered should be levied without alteration or any additional duties, customs, or other impositions to be laid on any goods exported or imported for the future.\" His grace's friends evidently feel that this act of Tynwald is decisive on the question. They say the Keys \"claimed, or assumed to themselves the right of confirming the rate.\" This is not correct: it was not assumed; their right is admitted. If it could be pretended that the proprietor himself was then unapprized of the extent of his prerogative, does he not appear to have been surrounded by his officers and magistrates? Seven of them subscribe this law. Can it be possible that this despotic power could have had an existence in right, and none of these persons whisper in the lord's ear that he was imposed on? can any man believe that they would all be parties in a robbery of the lord; and not merely of the lord, but of themselves? The rates of 1692, appear to have been imposed; not by the lord singly, but by the lord and council: what could induce the council to combine with the Keys against the lord by whom they were appointed, to deprive him and themselves of power unlimited, but legal?&#x2014;Decisive evidence has, I think, been given, that this right of arbitrary taxation never resided in the lord. But if there were a doubt, a fit occasion offered when the commissioners were on the spot, for its solution. At the proper time, in the proper place, and before competent judges, his grace of Atholl did not think it convenient to institute this enquiry. Sir, I must infer, and any man must infer, he did not, because he knew it would be decided against him.&#x2014;But admitting for a moment the arguments adduced against this odious claim not to be satisfactory; that the evidence on either side was balanced; still I should hope this house must come to a decision favourable to the Keys. It is probable, the practice in this island must have been analogous to that in the surrounding kingdoms. In ours, I deny there ever existed a right to tax the people without their own concurrence.&#x2014;Some modern historians attempt to fix the period when representation began. Vain the attempt! It was not the gift of an Henry or an Edward. From our Saxon progenitors we derive it; and coeval with our representation was the right in the popular assembly to grant or to with-226hold taxes from their sovereign.&#x2014;Such a claim as the present seems at war with the very fundamental laws of society. And here, sir, let me appeal to the authority of one, whose name gives weight to all he has written; to whom the general admission of his own and every succeeding generation, has allowed a place amongst the most enlightened of men. The works of this great man have been thought worthy the particular attention of a prelate, as distinguished by his piety, as he was eminent by his learning and talents. Presiding over one of the colleges at Cambridge, he encouraged the study of the work to which I allude, as the best foundation for the forming pure public principles. Often has he to me inculcated the utility of its frequent perusal; and happy I am in this opportunity of expressing my veneration for the memory of this worthy prelate; my gratitude for his kindness; and the pride I feel in claiming him as my relation. I allude to Locke's immortal treatise on government, as edited by bishop Law. \"If any one,\" he says, \"shall claim a power to lay and levy taxes on the people by his own authority, and without consent of the people, he hereby invades the fundamental law of property, and subverts the end of government; for what property have I in that which another may by right take when he pleases to himself?&#x2014;But to return to the labours of this committee; they have asserted, sir, that the intervention of the Keys was confined, in all instances but one, to matters of internal regulation. Extraordinary assertion! look at their own evidence. On the 3d August, 1711, you find an act of Tynwald for \"preventing frauds in her majesty's customs;\" this is an insular mischief-act which originated in the suggestion of custom-house officers there resident. Had it not been at a subsequent period suspended, this act alone would have cut up smuggling by the roots. The only boon the Keys asked in return, was the liberty of vending their native produce among their wealthier neighbours. It was refused them.&#x2014;I am sorry, sir, here to remark the contrast between the then conduct of this little community, and that of the servants of the crown, the wisdom of the insular legislature, in preferring the advantages resulting from regular industry, as a more certain road to prosperity than the specious profit of illicit commerce. A more enlightened policy would have induced the treasury to comply with so reasonable a227petition; to have conferred it as a favour, if not as a right. Conceiving, then, that no alternative remained but to smuggle or starve, in 1713 the insular legislature suspend the former beneficial law; and probably the smuggler soon resumed his ancient habits.&#x2014;After the feudal proprietor had once consented to the abolition of illicit traffic, it would ill have become him personally to sanction its renewal. To relieve him, perhaps, from this odium, the plan was adopted of granting a lease of his customs to two strangers. The tempting offer was made of a rent of 1000 guineas; and the magnificent idea put in practice of resorting to foreign India companies for a supply of teas and other commodities to smuggle on our shores.&#x2014;Then followed the act,of the 7th Geo. I. inhibiting such importations, except from the mother-country: and within a few years the drawback on goods exported to the island was disallowed.&#x2014;The lessees' profits from farming these customs being thus curtailed, they offered to surrender their term. It was accepted. But does it appear that the feudal proprietor claimed indemnity for the diminution of his profits? A defalcation then probably took place in his income from this source, of 800l. a year, nearly equal to 3000l. at the present day. But we do not find that any complaint was uttered, any allegation made, of wrong done him by parliament in thus abridging his customs. Again, in 1726, the court of Tynwald pass and proclaim a law, approved by the lord, restraining the exportation of salt. Within five years after occurs a strange measure, indeed, for this puissant monarch of man, possessing powers greater than the sovereign of England. Our king can circulate copper coin by proclamation: but here it appears that the feudal proprietor was obliged to go to the house of Keys, for leave to give currency to a few hundred pounds worth of halfpence.&#x2014;On the whole, sir, on this head of the subject, I appeal with perfect confidence and perfect security to the evidence collected by this committee themselves, as proving the direct contrary of their assertions.&#x2014;The last subject, sir, to which I shall entreat the attention of the committee, is that of the revenue under the feudal proprietor. I must hero also begin with entering my protest against treating this object by any means as private property, transferable from hand to hand, or to be made a subject of sale. It is undoubtedly the right of the people;228paid for their benefit; and not to be considered, at any time, or under any circumstances, as merely a source of profit to an individual.&#x2014;By the Derby family it was never probably so viewed. Their princely fortune put them above the need of the miserable produce of these duties. The legislature must have intended them as a small aid toward the defraying the expences of civil government, then wholly incumbent on the proprietor's land-revenue. This his grace retains, liberated from the burthen of civil or military expenditure.&#x2014;Another circumstance I must notice, as placing this subject in a false light, which is the calculating the probable amount of the proprietor's duties in 1765, on present produce, present consumption, or present actual importation. The population in the intermediate time has arisen one half. The degree of increase taken place in the wealth of the island it is difficult to calculate. A comparison between the rents paid then and now would indicate an advance from four to eight times the amount in 1765. With the increased numbers, and the increased means of the inhabitants, how great must be the increase of duties on imported luxuries !&#x2014;But as we must take some criterion, let us even take this most favourable one to the noble claimant. Pursuing it with the attorney and solicitor general, it turns out, that the revenue to the lord, on the most favourable year that had then occurred, according to the antient scale of duty, would have produced 846l. 19s. To which, it is admitted, should be added, the average produce of a duty on herring-boats, a salmon fishery, &c.; 222l. Making together 1068l. 19s.&#x2014;I have also, sir, two calculations, one on an average of seven years, of the actual importations, which, with the addition of the 222l. still does not amount to 1000l. The other, formed on the importations of 1802, the year in which the largest importations ever known were made into the island. With the same addition, this would amount to 1270l. The calculation given in by his grace to the committee makes the licensed articles produce 686l. 3s. 9d. The ad-valorem articles 2199l. Now, sir, it is pretty remarkable, that on a head which can be ascertained, namely, the duties on licensed articles, we agree so closely; but on another, which is not reducible to the same certainty, his grace should differ so widely from every other computation. The same regard to candour which induced the229attorney and solicitor general to give the due credit for the last sum of 222l. would also have induced them to notice their omission, on the other hand, had they been aware of it, to deduct from the amount, the expenses of collection, of the civil government, and all the other charges on the sovereign. In the same, or in a higher ratio, these must have advanced. In 1765 they appear to have amounted to 777l. currency. At this day it is probable they would have absorbed every shilling of these duties.&#x2014;Another observation I must make, Mr. Speaker, is, that these receipts and payments are but in Manks currency; that is, one seventh less than sterling.&#x2014;Thinking, as I do, any reference to present circumstances, in order to draw results applicable to a state of things forty years ago, to be fallacious in itself, and injurious to the cause of the public and the island, still, sir, I cannot avoid making a few further remarks on the computations thus founded.&#x2014;On behalf of the duke of Atholl, a paper of calculations was laid before the committee, applying, as it is said, the rates of 1692, to the importations of 1802.&#x2014;Beside the articles of licensed goods, the present great source of the insular revenue, it appears that in 1802, upon non-enumerated goods, paying certain per-centages, varying from 15 to 2&#x00BD; per cent. arose a revenue of 2198l. 16s. 10d. From that same source, I am informed, his grace computes the propriety per-centage at 2199l. In no case, I believe, but with regard to corn as a matter of regulation, did this exceed 2&#x00BD; per cent. on goods now imported free of duty, or subject to a per-centage.&#x2014;Now, sir, premising that a large proportion of the island, probably a third, perhaps a half, is mountain; assuming the number of productive acres at 160,000, and their average rent at ten shillings; in both instances I doubt exceeding the truth, the amount of rent will be 80,000l.&#x2014;Next, sir, calculating what would be the value of goods to be imported in one year to produce at 2&#x00BD; per cent. 2199l. I find it to be 87,960l. So then beside the principal fund from which these customs arise, namely, duties on licensed goods, the great articles of importation, and which can be ascertained, it is necessary for his grace's case to assert, that the value of non-enumerated goods imported into this still slenderly-peopled island, and which cannot be exactly ascertained, probably exceeds by the sum of 7960l. its whole rental.&#x2014;We see, then,230that to support his grace's case, proofs are resorted to, which in strictness do not apply: when these fancied proofs are examined, they are found, not disputable, not improbable, but, I verily believe, morally impossible to be true.&#x2014;To show how fluctuating the insular revenue is, and ever must be, when governed by a casualty so great as the good or ill success of the herring fishery, I must remark, that the gross amount of revenue in 1804, appears to have been 10,473l. 5s. 3&#x00BD;d. The fishery of that year failed. Had it been as successful as that of 1802, when the bounties amounted to 4001l. 6s. 1d. then, after payment of all charges, the surplus would have been 2625l. 15s. 5d. A pension of 300l. has since, it is said, been imposed on this revenue, which would therefore reduce this year's apparent surplus to 2325l. 15s.5d.&#x2014;The policy of the mother-country, sir, the interests of the island itself, require that its staple, the fishery should receive every possible encouragement. With more hands, and more capital employed, it may yet be considerably extended. The bounties that may hereafter be claimed may call for the whole of the apparent surplus. I understand, indeed, that this event is by no means improbable. The continuance, the extension, or the increase of these bounties, would find in the duke of Atholl, of necessity, a constant enemy. But, sir, on the other hand, his utmost care has been, and would continue to be, exerted to augment the customs. The accounts on your table prove the fluctuation of these customs: at present they are on the decline. The committee state, that the revenue of 1802 produced more than 1801, but of 1803 and 1804 they say nothing. Why? Because the inferences to be drawn from those years, though more to the purpose, do not suit their views of the subject.&#x2014;But, sir, each of these years, and every year, presents a too favourable view of the insular finance. All the commodities there imported are not, I fear, there consumed. I wished to call before the committee these receivers-general, to obtain from them the proof, that no inconsiderable proportion of duties arises in the Isle of Man, on commodities paying low duties, afterward clandestinely re-shipped and smuggled back again.&#x2014;Were the suggestion of the commissioners of enquiry adopted, of transferring to the board of customs the super-intendance of this revenue, their habits of attention, and their experience would soon231check these frauds.&#x2014;Among other evils resulting from its being placed in the hands we now find it, in the committee's report I observe the extraordinary admission that a sum of upward of 20,000l. arising from these customs, is suffered to remain in arrear. Where are we to look for this sum? Are we to advertise for it? Why is it not paid into the exchequer? Has not parliament precisely directed it to be so paid? But we are, I am grieved to say it, so habituated to the violations of acts of parliament, that we discover another flagrant instance, without any emotions of surprise.&#x2014;If this revenue were under the management of the customs, it is by no means probable its produce for so many years would be thus withheld; nor can I understand why this should be permitted.&#x2014;The present claim, by one of its supporters, who appears to admit it to be unfounded in justice, is put on some vague grounds of generosity or liberality. Sir, I am not ashamed to say, that as a member of parliament, as one of the guardians of the public purse, I do not comprehend the term. The liberality of an individual, out of that which is his own, I do understand, and know how to prize and honour. But how can I be liberal out of that which is riot my own? How can the guardian display his fine feelings at the expense of his ward? The member of parliament, out of the pockets of his constituents? But, sir, this act of liberality is attempted to be exercised, not out of the pockets of our constituents, but out of the pockets of those who have no representatives; who exclaim against it; who think it not liberality, but an act of profusion and injustice.&#x2014;So far from giving the present claimant further compensation, they say they are as well entitled to compensation as himself. They have had none, but would think it doubly hard to be exclusively subjected to this second and every further claim of compensation, the already compensated seller thinks fit to advance.&#x2014;We ought not, sir, to drop out of our view in what case the noble claimant himself is placed. You compensate a claim he alledges to be well founded out of an uncertain and fluctuating revenue: you put his interest in direct and constant opposition to the welfare of the island. It will be for ever the interest of him and his descendants to extract the utmost possible amount of duties, to depress as low as possible its necessary expenditure. The bounties to its fisheries, the charges of erecting232and improving public edifices, and every other public improvement; may be so much taken out of his rent-charge. It has been, for instance, thought that some of the insular magistrates and officers receive inadequate salaries. What hope can they have of increase? In short, what measure attended with increased expence will hereafter be effected, if the surplus becomes the joint property of the crown, and an individual? Do you not continue this family, of necessity, either their own enemies, or the hereditary and constant opponents of the island, benefiting by its charges, losing by the sums expended for its advantage? Do you not make it their interest to be perpetually proposing new taxes? Even with regard to the mother-country, the situation may not be void of danger. It will be the interest of the family to encourage, by every means, the largest possible importations; but perfectly indifferent in point of interest it be to them, whether these importations are consumed at home or elsewhere. Is this a situation in which a man ought to be placed?&#x2014;But if it be determined, sir, to admit this claim, if it must be compensated out of the means of those on whom last of all this burthen should be imposed, in the name of God do it at once! Exercise your omnipotence. Take what you please: you may do it with impunity. But do not, create, do not leave behind you a constant source of dissatisfaction. Do not erect a land-mark of discontent, by imposing perpetual burthens, which will at the same time perpetuate those feelings of indiguation which the present measure has excited. Consider how harsh it is to force these islanders to contribute for ever, to a cause which they disclaim and disown.&#x2014;Look, sir, at the case as applied to ourselves. Never was there raised in any country so great a revenue, when compared with its population. No man can pretend but that it is severely felt, yet, sir, it is paid with cheerfulness. Were even greater burthens necessary, so long as the exigencies of the state require it, and we have the means, those burthens we shall manfully bear. And why? Because we have the conviction that they are paid for our own benefit: that we are by that payment secured in the enjoyment of those advantages no other country possesses. Proudly conscious of the pre-eminent and inestimable blessings we enjoy, we are ready to contribute up to any amount the public exigencies may re-233quire. But I would ask the right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer, would these burthens be endured, it there were as general a conviction that they were applied to purposes of individual advantage? Again; would it be safe or prudent to impose the charge of remunerating an individual for services, however brilliant, on this or that town, or this or the other parish? What must be the feelings of the district on whom he was thus quartered? But still more, if its inhabitants considered the burthen imposed on them as arising from other motives than the merits of the favoured individual.&#x2014;The strength of the Isle of Man is its weakness. Its reliance is on the generosity and magnanimity of parliament. If you do them this wrong, and the effect he but momentary, in time they may forget it. The remembrance of past kindness, the hope of your returning favour, will afford sources of consolation: but do not, let me adjure you, do not inflict a wound that is to rankle and fester for ever.&#x2014;No grant exactly of the nature now proposed has ever, I believe, been made. However objectionable some of those the most nearly approaching it may have been, they are lost because coming out of the general mass. Why desert this policy? Why impose on one speck in the empire a burthen intended for the benefit of idividuals?&#x2014;On the whole, I would observe, that the allegations in this petition are unproved and unfounded; that the feudal proprietors did not possess an arbitrary power of imposing taxes; that neither Henry IV. nor James I. in fact, granted, or could grant it; that if it had been attempted to be granted, that it would have been an abuse of power in the grantor; void and illegal in itself; that the duties of 1577 might be legal; but those of 1692 are clearly against law, and fraudulent, till confirmed by the insular legislature; that even at this day the revenue transferred by the proprietors to the crown, certainly could not on its gross produce have averaged 1200l. a year; and probably would not have covered the expences which were incumbent on it; that the present improvements of the island, from which even that revenue would be extracted, are the result of boons granted by the British parliament: that the right of legislation constantly exercised by parliament over the islanders, is founded on the best legal authorities: that the revenue, parliament imposes, the islanders pay cheerfully; but234had they resisted its first imposition, what hope could they have entertained of success? Abandoned by their natural protector; without a friend! with the just odium upon them attaching to this nefarious traffic, that resistance must have been fruitless.&#x2014;The surplus of their revenue they perceive set apart by parliament, undoubtedly for their use. Other proofs of the moderation of parliament toward them they acknowledge, and of the exercise of this branch of its power they do not complain.&#x2014;As to compensation to the noble claimant, this has already been given most amply, as far as money can be its measure. The last proprietor of this regality, weighing the solid advantages to his rent-roll, by parting with the island, against the gratification to be derived from its possession, preferred, and I think wisely, that which was beneficial to his family, to the pride of grasping in his hand a barren sceptre. But if the thing must be done, let it be done in the way least offensive to the feelings of the payers. I trust, however, it will not be done. On the part of the people of the Isle of Man, I protest against its injustice. As a member of parliament, I protest against such a waste of the public money. Never was there a period when it behoved us more narrowly to watch its expenditure. On these grounds I move, \"that the further consideration of this report be put off to this day three months.\"", "author_id": "/people/mr-john-curwen", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

He trusted, that his general conduct, that the important obligations imposed upon him by his rank, character, and situation, afforded a sufficient pledge, that his mind could be influenced by no other motive. With regard to the question now before the house, he was far from feeling the difficulties which presented themselves to the mind of his noble188and learned friend. The ends of \"substantial justice\" required, that the former evidence should be communicated to both parties, unless some positive regulation of the house prevented it: but so far was this from being the case, that their lordships had already ordered copies of the petition, and charges against Mr. justice Fox, to be delivered to him. Surely, if it was right to furnish him with written papers, there could be no impropriety in giving him such as were printed. If, however, their lordships thought right to confine themselves so strictly to analogy, the minutes of the evidence might be communicated to Mr. justice Fox in writing. But as to the question of furnishing papers, printed for the use of their lordships, to other persons, that he considered to be fully decided by the usage of the house. For several years he had been in the daily habit of receiving printed communications from the house. During the trial of Mr. Hastings, he received every day, a printed copy of the evidence, which was printed for the use of the house only. This communication was absolutely necessary, to enable the counsel to manage that important trial; and it was with the perfect knowledge of the house that they possessed it. He was seen with it at the bar, and it frequently was his duty to comment upon it. There were, therefore, two precedents in point, in the present case, in which their lordships had furnished a person accused with written communications; another, in which printed copies of evidence had been delivered to the accused party. No reasonable apprehension could be entertained of any proceeding of their lordships' house having an influence on the conduct of the courts below; the practice of these courts was guided by rules which long prescription had established. But their lordships must recollect, that they were now placed in a situation so anomalous, that no example, drawn from the practice of courts of law, could be expected to apply to it. It had been the lot of their lordships, in the course of the proceedings on this important case, to sustain very different characters. One character, at the commencement of the proceedings, had been assumed from the most honourable of motives; and if blame was imputable in that stage of the business, he was proud to take his share of it. Their lordships were of opinion, that an accusation against a person, whose rank189and character were so truly respectable as that of the learned judge, ought not to be entertained without much delicacy. It was not unnatural to suppose that future accusations might possibly be made by persons whose talents and judgment might have less weight with the house, and who could not claim the attention which was due to the noble marquis. It was, therefore, anxiously wished to protect, by a previous enquiry, persons in the situation of the learned judge, from vexatious proceedings, instituted on frivolous charges. With all the imperfections that belonged to that previous proceeding, it had still the advantage of establishing one useful precedent.&#x2014;It demonstrated their lordships' determination to prevent any judge from being lightly accused. If this was an error, it was an honourable error, and one which originated in the best of motives. Their lordships were now in the situation of judges of the law, and the fact: In addition to that, they had formerly taken upon themselves the character of grand jurors, and it was naturally to be supposed that the evidence to which they had listened in the latter character, must have made someex parteimpression on their minds. To furnish the learned judge with copies of that evidence, was not throwing any discredit on the witnesses, but it was fit their lordships should have an opportunity of comparing the expressions they then used, with those they would now employ upon farther consideration. Such a comparison was necessary, to enable the house to form an opinion of the character, and credit which were due to the evidence of each witness adduced on the part of the prosecution. In a proceeding so entirely new, and anomalous, the means of such a comparison certainly would not be denied, if it could be, afforded consistently with the regulations of the house. The prevent motion went no farther, than to bring the evidence before their lordships. When the proceedings should be on the table, it would be time to determine, whether or not they should be printed; but he was incapable of conceiving how any mischief could arise from their being printed, and furnished to the learned judge. He had already shown that such a course was authorized by precedent; and he was convinced, that, in adopting it on the present occasion, no form of their lordships' house could possibly be violated.", "author_id": "/people/mr-edward-law-1", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},

{"date": ["1805", "jun", "07"], "content": "seeing the house194disposed to proceed, said he should no longer delay his intended motion. The hon. colonel spoke as follows:&#x2014;sir, the proceedings of the late naval court martial held upon vice-admiral sir John Duckworth having been printed and published by the admiral himself, it cannot be the wish either of the admiral nor that of his friends to suppress or keep from public discussion a subject to which they have themselves given such publicity, and therefore I trust there will not be any difference in opinion to prevent those proceedings, and other papers relating to this business, from being laid upon the table of this house. With permission of the house, I will beg leave to read captain Wood's memorial to the lords commissioners of the admiralty, together with the legal opinions given upon a case, for the purpose of ascertaining how far the court martial decided according to their oaths, and according to the 18th article of war. \"The Memorial of Captain James Athol Wood, \"Humbly sheweth, that the sentence of the court martial lately held upon vice-admiral sir J. Duckworth having not only most honourably acquitted the vice-admiral of the several charges preferred against him, but having also declared in general and unqualified terms those charges to have been gross, unfounded, malicious, and scandalous, your memorialist would consider himself unworthy of the commission which he has the honour to bear in his majesty's service, as well as wanting in that respect which he owes to the lords commissioners of the admiralty, were he not, with the greatest deference and respect, to state to their lordships, that so far from the charges which he preferred against vice-admiral Duckworth having been either gross, unfounded, malicious, or scandalous, your memorialist trusts he shall be able to satisfy your lordships, that such charges have been as fully substantiated as it was possible for them to be, under all those unfavourable circumstances under which your memorialist was placed.&#x2014;With respect to the first charge, for oppression in superseding your memorialist in the command of the Acasta, under the pretext of appointing him to the Hercule, a ship of greater consequence, your memorialist begs leave to submit the following observations for your lordships' consideration: after having been constantly and195actively employed under admiral Cornwallis, off Brest, from the commencement of the war, towards the end of last November your lordships were pleased to direct him to proceed to the West Indies with a large and valuable fleet; and on the 2d of February your memorialist arrived with this fleet at Port Royal in Jamaica.&#x2014;The second day after the arrival of your memorialist at that station, vice-admiral Duckworth gave him notice of his determination to remove your memorialist from the command of his own frigate the Acasta into the Hercule, 74-gun ship, at that time at sea; alledging for so unusual and so cruel an exertion of power, not only the good of his majesty's service, but his intention of promoting your memorialist to the command of a ship of superior class. It appears, not only from the evidence of captain Dunn, admiral Duckworth's captain, by whom your lordships' appointment was superseded, but also by the evidence of the admiral's secretary, that admiral Dacres,long before the Acasta arrived, had declared his intention of hoisting his flag on board of the Hercule, and to carry with him his captain and officers. This fact admiral Duckworth never has denied; and accordingly admiral Dacres did hoist his flag on board of the Hercule before your memorialist sailed from Jamaica.&#x2014;It is therefore evident, that the reason which the vice-admiral assigned in his public letter for superseding your memorialist, namely, the good of the service, and giving him the Command of a ship of greater consequence, was false and groundless, and calculated merely to give a colour of justice to an act of the greatest stretch of power, cruelty, and oppression.&#x2014;If the ostensible pretext, that the good of the service required the vice-admiral's return to England on board of the Acasta, your memorialist was surely fully competent to have commanded to England that ship which the lords of the admiralty had so long been pleased to entrust to his charge.&#x2014;Thus, after serving in his majesty's navy upwards of thirty years, without any alledged offence, but on the contrary the strongest testimonies of zealous services, your memorialist has been most oppressively and most unjustly deprived of the command of his majesty's ship Acasta; and, in aggravation to his grievances, compelled to beg and to intreat a passage to Europe on board of his own ship, in a situation very however, inadequate to his rank; whereas two pas196sengers, totally unconnected with his majesty's service, occupied his former cabin; all of which tending to degrade and to lessen your memorialist in the eyes of a ship's company, so long devoted and attached to your memorialist.&#x2014;The second charge against the admiral was, for having, in violation of the 18th article of war, loaded on board of the Acasta various goods and merchandizes, otherwise than for the sole use of his majesty's ship. In support of this second charge, your memorialist has proved by the admission of the admiral himself, that he had loaded on board of the Acasta eleven logs and two slabs of mahogany, measuring at least 16 tons; about 150 1b. weight of Spanish snuff, of the value of upwards of 200 guineas; from 30 to 40 casks of shaddocks and fruits, upwards of 20 pipes and puncheons of wine, rum, &c.; &c.; exclusive of liquors and various articles of household furniture, allowed to be 40 tons and upwards, but which, in the belief of your memorialist, exceeded 100. By the evidence of captain Dunn, the Acasta appeared to him to have been so loaded and lumbered as to have resembled a West Indiaman, and that in direct violation to the printed instruction, the spirit-room prepared for preserving in safety his majesty's spirits, had been cleared out, and the ship's spirits removed into the hold, a very dangerous and insecure place, to make room for the vice-admiral's wines and spirits. It has also been proved, that many of the seamen had been removed from their mess places and births, to stow betwixt decks logs of mahogany and articles of household furniture made up in the island of Jamaica, where, by the evidence of the joiner of the Hercule, he had been employed at the admiral's pen three years.&#x2014;By the 18th article of war, it is expressly declared, that if any officer of any or his majesty's ships of war, shall receive on board, or permit to be received on board such ship or vessel, any goods or merchandizes whatsoever, excepting for the sole use of the ship or vessel, and being convicted thereof, shall be cashiered, and for ever afterwards rendered incapable to serve in the naval service of his majesty. Exclusive thereof, it is further enacted, that any officer so offending, or owner of such goods, shall be liable to forfeit the full value of such goods, to be recovered in a court of law. It is, however, evident from the sentence of this court martial, that nothing loaded on board197of the Acasta, were deemed by those who have so decided, goods or merchandizes, either, because they had not been loaded on board by merchants, or proof adduced of the vice-admiral's intention to sell or to dispose of such goods. If under the head of \"goods or merchandize,\" the legislature only meant goods of which undoubted proof could be adduced of the officer's intention to sell, and the evidence of such intention is to be the confession of the party accused, or the evidence of those connected with him; your memorialist begs leave most respectfully to submit to your lordships, that a door would in such a case be opened, and a most dangerous and extensive latitude given, to the greatest possible abuses. Under the name of \"presents,\" his majesty's ships of war might be converted to the private emolument of individuals, to the utter ruin and destruction of the naval service of his majesty.&#x2014;From this consideration, as well as for the purpose of satisfying himself and friends, that the sentence of the late court martial had been most unjust, founded upon most erroneous opinions, and had grossly injured and insulted the character and feelings of an officer, over whose conduct they had no cognizance; your memorialist was induced to state a case for the opinion of the first lawyers in this country, a copy of which he begs leave to submit for their lordships' information.&#x2014;This case your memorialist begs leave to observe, has been drawn in the most favourable terms for the vice-admiral; admitting that every article loaded by him on board of the Acasta, could be proved to have been intended for presents, and not for sale. Notwithstanding of which, the most eminent lawyers in England have given it as their opinion, that if the court martial had decided according to the 18th article of war, the vice-admiral must inevitably have been cashiered, and for ever rendered incapable of serving his majesty.&#x2014;That the admiral's conduct, in super-seding your memorialist in the command of the Acasta, was unjust, cruel, and oppressive, and that the lords commissioners of the admiralty had not deemed the charge unfounded, your memorialist is warranted in appealing to your lordships, having been pleased immediately on hearing of so unprecedented a stretch of power, to re-appoint your memorialist to the command of the Acasta; a circumstance of which he was unacquainted at the time when he requested a court martial to be198held upon the vice-admiral.&#x2014;That the sentence of the court martial, in acquitting the vice-admiral of the second charge, viz. loading on board of the Acasta, goods and merchandize not intended for the sole use of the ship, is highly illegal and unjust, and is in direct violation of two acts of parliament made for the express purpose of restraining naval officers from such unofficer-like practices, he is warranted in asserting, upon the first legal opinions of England herewith inclosed.&#x2014;Under all these circumstances, and a due consideration of the harsh, cruel, and unmerited treatment which your memorialist has received, he trusts your lordships will be pleased to direct that the proceedings and sentence of this court martial, together with this memorial, be submitted for the opinion of his majesty's law officers, or if, judged necessary, for that of his majesty's judges, in order that your memorialist may have an opportunity of vindicating his character, and of obtaining that justice to which he may appear entitled: and your memorialist shall ever pray. James Athol, Wood, captain r. navy.\" Pall-Mall, May 25, 1805.&#x2014;xviiith article of war. \"If any captain, commander, or other officer of any of his majesty's ships or vessels, shall receive on board, or permit to be received on board such ship or vessel, any goods or merchandizes whatsoever, other than for the sole use of the ship or vessel; except gold, silver, or jewels, and except the goods or merchandizes belonging to any merchant, or other ship or vessel which may be shipwrecked, or in imminent danger of being shipwrecked, either on the high seas, or in any port, creek, or harbour, in order to the preserving them for their proper owners; and except such goods or merchandizes as he shall at any time be ordered to take or receive on board by order of the lord high admiral of great Britain, or the commissioners for executing the office of lord high admiral for the time being; every person so offending, being convicted thereof by the sentence of a court martial, shall be cashiered, and be for ever afterwards rendered incapable to serve in any place or office in the naval service of his majesty, his heirs and successors.

Duckworth deprived of his ship for the purpose of conferring the command upon his own captain, has served in the royal navy upwards of thirty years, and is a post-captain of eight or nine years standing.&#x2014;About three years ago lord St. Vincent appointed him to the command of the Acasta frigate of 44 guns, one of the finest frigates in the navy; and from the recommencement of the war until last November he was employed under admiral Cornwallis in the blockade off Brest, and other French ports.&#x2014;Were it necessary to have references to captain Wood's character in the navy, lord St. Vincent, admirals Cornwallis and Harvey, and many other distinguished officers will bear ample testimony to his merits. Towards the end of last November, the lords commissioners of the admiralty ordered captain Wood to Jamaica with a. valuable convoy of ships, where he arrived the beginning of February. He was the unfortunate bearer of vice-admiral Duckworth's recal, and of admiral Dacres' appointment to succeed him in that command.&#x2014;Admiral Duckworth determined upon returning home in the Acasta, which, as senior officer, he had an un-203doubted right to do, although, had the good of his majesty's service been consulted, he would not have kept that frigate under the walls of Port Royal idle one month until the yellow fever commenced its havock; there were many other frigates that required coming home to England, in which the vice-admiral might have been accommodated. Had admiral Duckworth returned in the Acasta under the command of that captain to whom the lords of the admiralty had thought proper to intrust the command of her, not only the common usage of the service, but that attention which every officer is bound to pay to the common calls of justice and of humanity would have been preserved, but this would not have suited nor have answered the admiral's purposes.&#x2014;The Acasta was a large roomy frigate, and the admiral had a number of things to bring home, which he durst not ask any captain, a stranger, to permit to be loaded on board, and which no one but a confidential friend would have suffered to pass unnoticed. There was also a large freight of treasure to be brought home from Jamaica, 7-eighths of the commission on which captain Wood was entitled to; the other eighth to the admiral. Admiral Duckworth therefore not only determined to return to England in the Acasta, but to deprive captain Wood of the command of her, for the purpose of conferring it upon captain Dunn, the admiral's captain and confidential friend; and for this purpose the vice-admiral appoints capt. Wood to the Hercule, a 74-gun ship, at that time at sea, and assigns as his reason, the giving him a ship of greater consequence. This reason captain Wood knew to be false and groundless, and, as I shall shew hereafter, the vice-admiral himself acknowledged to be so. Independent of this confession of the vice-admiral, admiral Dacres (his successor in the command) bad informed captain Wood officially that he had determined to hoist his flag on board of the Hercule the instant she returned to port, which he accordingly did, and which the vice-admiral knew he would do, before the Acasta arrived at Jamaica.&#x2014;In this manner, sir, was capt. Wood dispossessed of the command of his ship, the distress and mortification resulting therefrom had nearly deprived him of his reason, and labouring under this affliction without a friend on whom he could confide, or with whom he could advise, for the vice-admiral had shifted all the officers; 170 of the ship's com-204pany, as well as the captain of the Acasta, is it to be wondered at, that the vice-admiral should have had the advantage of him at his trial, whose honest sensibility had to contend with power and systematic arrangements, supported by prejudice and partiality, nay even perjury?&#x2014;Exclusive of losing his ship, admiral Duckworth deprived him of at least 2000l. commission, to which he was entitled as commander of the Acasta, as much as to his pay, either given to captain Dunn, or arranged in whatever other manner the admiral chose to dispose of it.&#x2014;To reconcile to the common feelings of mankind, much more to justify so strong a measure, common prudence required that the motives of the vice-admiral himself should have been perfectly pure and disinterested, but it can be proved, that so far from having been actuated by any disinterested and honourable motive, that at tins very time he must have had in contemplation the violation of an act of parliament for which the removal of captain Wood from the ship was absolutely necessary.&#x2014;In the first place, let me call the attention of the house to the defence which the vice-admiral offers for superseding an officer commanding one of his majesty's ships under a commission from the lords commissioners of the admiralty, to give her to a prot&#x00E9;g&#x00E9; of his own; viz. \"that he could not commit the honour of his flag, and his own character to the chapter of accidents, nor cross the Atlantic in a ship commanded by a stranger.\" Good God, sir, could there be a more gross or more scandalous libel against the whole of the captains of the British navy? Excepting captain Dunn, this admiral durst not trust himself in a ship during a few weeks' passage with any British captain with whom he had not a personal acquaintance, and, strange to relate, there could be found a majority of three admirals and nine captains of the British navy, deliberately, in the character of judges, to recognize and approve of this act of violence. by which they acknowledge, that a commission from the admiralty is no protection to them against the whim, or caprice, or revenge, of a commander in chief on a foreign station, who may shift them from the finest frigate in the service into any old hulk bearing a pendant, so that she happens to be of a superior class in the navy list, even when recalled from command, and not going upon service: what have not those gentlemen to answer for to their205brother officers?&#x2014;Let me now submit to the house how totally at variance are the actions and professions of the vice-admiral. By the 18th article of war, \"every naval officer, who either loads on board, or permits to be laden on board of any ship of war, goods or merchandize, excepting for the sole use of the ship, is not only to be cashiered, but to be rendered for ever incapable of serving his majesty. Admiral Duckworth had loaded on board of the Acasta, by his own admission, 11 logs and 2 slabs of mahogany, large wardrobes made at Jamaica by the carpenters of the ship who were eating the king's provisions, and receiving the king's pay, and employed by the vice-admiral for the purpose of making the furniture to be used in his house in England. Any noble-minded man, sir, would have said to his successor, \"these are articles which I found necessary to the convenience and comfort of my command, they have been made at little experience to me, pray consider them as belonging to the house assigned for the commander in chief, and as I now transfer them to you, do you take care that they are transferred to your successor.\" This, sir, might have justified the making them at the king's expence; but to manufacture them at Jamaica, and send them to England in packages, (for it is not pretended that they were put on board for the admiral's use on the passage home,) they can be considered only as articles of trade. I should be glad to know how the captain of the ship, who mustered Redhouse, the admiral's joiner, (as he is called in the minutes of the court martial,) for the three years he was working, on shore, would answer to a charge of false muster, were it to be brought against him and the admiral. With regard to the mahogany, of which there were eleven logs from two to three feet thick, and from 10 to 14 feet long each, also two slabs (stock for a first-rate cabinet-maker in London), I will venture to pronounce, that there is not a member of this house who will say, that those articles could be considered as any thing but \"goods and merchandize,\" within both the spirit and the letter of the act of parliament. There were also shipped on board the Acasta about 20 casks of wine and rum, and from 30 to 40 casks of fruit, besides various other articles not worthy of notice; none of which have been alledged as for the ship's use. To make room for those, he was obliged, if not actually to turn seamen out of their usual206sleeping places, at least to make it very inconvenient to them, and to deprive them of those comforts to which our gallant tars were so well entitled. Capt. Dunn has acknowledged that he ordered the spirit-room to be cleared out and the spirits belonging to his majesty to be stowed in the hold, for the purpose of stowing the admiral's wines and spirits in the public spirit-room, in direct violation of the naval printed instructions, which state particularly the manner in which the spirit-room is to be fitted up, and the wine and spirits are to be taken care of by the purser, who (say the instructions) is never to expect any allowance for leakage of wine or spirits, but to see that the casks be sound and full at their coming on board, and to be answerable for the care of them afterwards, there being proper conveniences made in the hold for securing them from abuses, which are not to be employed to any other use whatsoever.&#x2014;Had captain Wood commanded the Acasta, not a log of mahogany nor any of those various articles enumerated, and acknowledged to have been loaded on board, could have been introduced on board his majesty's ship, without subjecting himself to the penalties of the 18th article of war. Captain Dunn, by his friendly complaisance to his admiral's wishes, is now placed in that unfortunate situation, liable to be tried by a court martial, and dismissed the service.&#x2014;Notwithstanding admiral Duckworth's oppressive and unjust conduct was most clearly proved before the court martial, and indeed admitted by the lords of the admiralty themselves, by their having immediately re-appointed capt. Wood to the command of the Acasta; notwithstanding it was clearly proved by captain Dunn, that the spirit-room, in direct violation of the naval instructions, (pages 120 and 203,) was cleared out to make way for the admiral's liquors; notwithstanding it was admitted by the admiral himself, that he had on board 11 logs and 2 slabs of mahogany, several wardrobes, 200 guineas worth of Spanish snuff, 20 casks of wine and spirits, and 30 or 40 casks of fruit, with various other articles. A naval court martial has not merely acquitted him, but most fully and most honourably acquitted him, of every part of the charge; navy, not satisfied with his acquittal, they have declared the charges gross, unfounded, malicious and scandalous. So illegal and so unjust a sentence, I will venture to assert, upon the207never was pronounced by any court martial.&#x2014;Thus, sir, has not only an act of parliament, formed for the express purpose of restricting naval officers from converting his majesty's ships of war to the private emolument of individuals, been not merely set at defiance, but by the sanction of a court martial the door has been thrown open to abuses, which if not speedily remedied, must end in the ruin of the discipline and good government of the naval service of this country.&#x2014;When even the laws of the country may not have provided any direct and easy road for the protection of individuals from gross and premeditated violence and injustice, but more particularly when those acts of injustice and oppression have been committed against a servant of the public, employed on the public service. I humbly conceive, sir, it is the bounden duty of this house, not merely to enquire, but to sift such matters to the bottom, that they may support, without affection or favour, that high character to which I trust the country will ever look up with confidence.&#x2014;In the present instance, sir, it is not merely acts of gross violence and injustice that is complained of, but the most daring breach of an act of parliament of the very first importance to this country. Under such circumstances, sir, precedent would be unnecessary, but there must be upon record many precedents, not merely respecting the interference of this house, but of courts of law to correct and controul the unjust and illegal proceedings of courts martial. One immediately occurs, and is mentioned by that very able and respectable gentleman, Mr. Mac Arthur, to whom the public is so much indebted for his excellent treatise upon naval courts martial.&#x2014;Capt. Norris was brought to a court martial at his own desire, for misbehaviour off Toulon in the business of Mathews and Lestock; the prosecutor lieutenant Jekyll of the same ship.&#x2014;Lieutenant Jekyll, Palliser, and others addressed the admiralty, complaining of the proceedings of this court martial; the same as captain Wood has done in the present instance. The proceedings were laid before the house of commons, and they were declared to have been partial, arbitrary, and illegal. Admiral Rowley was the president of 25 captains, members of this court martial. Another instance happened the year before of the interference of the court of common pleas.&#x2014;Lieut. Frye of the marines was brought208to a court martial, by the captain of the Oxford man of war, for his disobedience of orders. Sir Chaloner Ogle was president of this court martial. He was sentenced to imprisonment, and to be dismissed the service. He recovered of sir Chaloner Ogle 1000 guineas damages; and lord chief justice Wills told him, he would support an action against every other member of the court martial. He next proceeded against two other members: admiral Mayne and captain Renton, at that time members of a court martial, assembled at Deptford to try admiral Lestock. The court martial addressed the admiralty and his majesty, violently complaining of judge Wills's intereference. The judge issued his capias against every member who signed the address, and they were only pardoned upon the most submissive apoloigy.&#x2014;I shall therefore move, \"that there be laid upon the table of this house the proceedings of a late naval court martial held upon vice-admiral Duckworth; the memorial of Captain Wood to the lords commissioners of the admiralty, dated the 25th instant; accompanying a case, and opinions of the attorney and solicitor general, Messrs.

The members of that house could not be termed representatives of the people, for they were self-elected. The lords of the treasury in 1765 had been authorized to treat with the representatives of the lords of the island, without any supposition that any other parties were entitled. The Duke of Atholl refused to alienate his rights. It was not till the government of this country shewed a disposition to abridge those rights that the alienation was agreed to. The commercial pretensions of this country to legislate for Ireland and America were abandoned; there was no better right to legislate for Man, except as the holders of the rights of the lords. The customs235revenue since 1798 had increased from 6,000l. to 16,000l. a year, and the compensation which was to be regulated by the result of the experiment was claimed accordingly. The sum of 70,000l. with the pension was an inadequate compensation. He adverted to the purchase of the heritable jurisdictions of Scotland, which were very highly paid for, from the consideration of the honours surrendered.

Whatever ingenious reasoning might have been employed by the hon. and learned baronet, there were no facts to shew that the duke of Atholl was independent of this control. The commissioners appointed to enquire into this business said, that if the custom duties were increased, it must have been with the consent of theClaves Insul&#x0153;, who would require a return for such a concession. How, then, could the duke obtain an increase of revenue from this source to the extent that had been pretended? The only question of importance was, if the compensation already made to the house of Atholl was grossly inadequate: if it were not, there could be no sufficient reason for opening what had so long been closed. The increase of profit, from the advance of population, and the improvement of the state of society, could not be any fit ground for such a proceeding. He was in the privy council when this subject was before it, it was not, therefore, wholly new to him. The matter was at that time referred to the law officers of the crown, and their report was received with the respect it deserved. To this report the noble duke was permitted to reply, by the exercise of unusual indulgence, in the form of a memorial; and before the decision of the council was laid before his majesty, his grace applied to submit some new facts, to which also the privy council condescended, with the express injunction, that these new facts should not only be new236but important.

The whole affair had been charged as a ministerial job. He should not easily be suspected of conducing to any project of this kind, and the doubt to was not what the duke of Atholl should receive in remuneration, but whether the house of commons should preserve that dignity and justice in its proceedings, by which it should be ever characterised. Much of the argument had been applied to the sovereign rights of the house of Atholl. He should have been extremely glad to have seen the right hon. the attorney-general in his place, to have denied the existence of such rights, and as he did not appear in his place to support his former opinion, he might at least be permitted to238conjecture, that the right hon. and learned gentleman had abandoned his former sentiments.

But he had not yet seen any country which was not obliged, sooner or698later, to have recourse to compulsion. France had adopted that system before the revolution, and there was not a country on the continent in which it was not practised to a greater or lesser extent. How was it to be supposed, then, that in this flourishing country, considering the great competition which manufactures and agriculture presented, our army could be kept up, without at length resorting to a similar expedient? Enlisting men for a limited period, had already, in some instances, been tried, and had not answered the purpose, nor did he think it ever could. The best means of raising men, was to interest as many as possible in the raising of them. On what other principle was it that the ballot had been found so effectual, but from the circumstance of every person feeling himself interested in the business? As to the volunteer system, he differed widely in his opinion of it, from the hon. mover; nor did he think that any officer in the army would feel hurt at seeing officers of volunteers. For his own part, it gave him pleasure to see men active in the service of their country, and exposing themselves to inconvenience without the prospect of any recompence.

In the one view it must be obvious to the person enlisting that he had an option; in the other, that he had none. It would be always in his power to change his service for a limited number of years, to a more extended service; but he could not,vice versa,change a service tor into one of a shorter endurance. It was not in nature, therefore, that he should not like the one be699ter than the other. Such, likewise, was the system in every other kingdom in Europe. It was a system of economy, as well as the only probable one which promised to be effectual. The price at which men could be obtained would be so much less, as amply to compensate the loss of more frequent recruitings, or rather those increased provision; for soldiers, as would engage most at the expiration. of their term to enter afresh. The honourable. member then proceeded to take a view of the different descriptions of force at present in the service of this country, and contended, that by the diversity jumble was occasioned, which made it difficult, if not impossible, to come at the actual statements; as the apparent increases were not in reality so, but were transfers from one part of our force to another. He particularly dwelt on the immense promises, but trifling effects, produced by Mr. Pitt's bill, Now it was admitted, even by the noble lord who had spoken to-night, that it had completely failed, and he contented himself with arguing, that, at all events, it could do no harm. This was a dreadful falling off from what was at first professed. Yet still the noble lord, averse even now to give up the bill, begs hard for a little longer trial. He shews what it produced during the last week, and calculating on a similar number yet for every week of the year, again argues that it has not had a sufficient trial. This reminded him of an apothecary whom he once knew, and of whom it used to be observed, that whenever any of his medicines was complained of by a patient, as not agreeing with him, he never failed to exclaim \"try it again.\" It had hen said, that the greater slumber of persons were interested in the recruiting the better it would go on, and that on this principle the bill was good for something, as it set 20,000 recruiters at work all at once. But it must be remembered, at the same time, that these men were not limited in the bounty; they might extend it to any sum not exceeding 341. a man; and therefore, instead of talking of these parish officers as 20,000 assistants, (or whatever the number was added, to the ordinary recruiters,) it was more just to describe them as 20,000 additional competitors in the market.", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-windham-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1805", "jul", "08"], "content": "accordingly addressed the house. The hon. member, adverting to a petition on the table from Mr. Todd Jones, (see p 641) expressed his regret that this petition had not been presented at an earlier period of the session, or that the hon. gent. who presented it had not given him notice of his intention to bring the subject before the house; because, in that case, he would have been enabled to have such a case laid before the house as would have fully vindicated his conduct, and that of the Irish government, with respect to the charge which the statement of the petitioner conveyed. But he was now, from the lateness of the session, placed in this dilemma, that he must either make an imperfect defence for himself and the government with which he had been connected, or bring forward circumstances which it would not be fair towards the character of the petitioner to mention, as he had not the immediate opportunity of replying to them. At the time when a right hon. gent. not then in his place, (Mr. Fitzgerald) gave notice of a motion with regard to the several persons arrested, and in custody in Ireland, under the suspension of the habeas corpus act, he did promise himself that such a motion would have afforded him an opportunity to exculpate the government of Ireland from the several charges which had been loosely thrown out against it. He naturally expected and wished that the motion of the right hon. gent. would have led to inquiry because upon such inquiry he had not the least doubt that the result would have been a full acquittal of the accused; nay more, a conclusive evidence of their title to public praise. After some further prefatory remarks the right hon. gent. proceeded to detail the circumstances connected with the attest and detention of Mr. Jones. For some time after his arrest, which the Irish government was induced to order upon information, the particulars of which he could not, for the reason already stated, with any propriety describe, but which were quite satisfactory to their minds as to the necessity of the measure, Mr. Jones remained in prison without any particular inquiry having been instituted into his case. As soon, however, as the trials, which followed the insurrection of 1803, and which so much occupied the attention of the Irish government, had terminated, an inquiry into the case of Mr. Jones took place, The three allegations in the petition which794he thought it necessary to notice were, first, the arrest of the petitioner; secondly, his being detained in prison after, as he states, the government had pronounced him innocent; and, thirdly, the harshness with which he was treated. Now, as to the first point, the right hon. gent. said, that he had already stated the impossibility of giving a full explanation to the house without acting unfairly towards the character of the petitioner. But as to the second point, inquiry being made, it was found that, although the conduct of Mr. Jones was such as justified the strongest suspicion, and would have warranted government in arresting any man; still he being a man of warm temper, and likely to use expressions, and indicate designs which he did not deliberately mean, it was the opinion of government that indulgence might be safely extended to him. In consequence of this opinion it was intimated to a gentleman of the highest respectability at the Irish bar (Mr. Saurin), who interested himself for the petitioner, that government was disposed to liberate him, provided he would quit Ireland, and retire to his residence in this country, where he had been for many years previous to his late return to Ireland. This intimation was communicated to the petitioner; and instead of replying directly to it, he immediately applied to the Irish government, asserting, that what proceeded from their disposition to leniency was a direct acknowledgement of his total innocence, and demanding instantaneous and unconditional liberation, with an indemnity; for his imprisonment. With that demand the Irish government would not feel themselves warranted in complying; particularly because, after the trial of the rebels, and the fullest investigation of the charges against Mr. Jones, his case became much more serious than it appeared to be at the out set. Willing, however, to act with every possible consistent mildness, his case was submitted to the crown lawyers, accompanied by this question, \"Whether it would be proper to liberate Mr. Jones?\" and their unanimous opinion was decidedly in the negative. Still more to ascertain the rectitude of their conduct, the Irish government transmitted the case of Mr. Jones to his majesty's ministers in this country, requiring their advice; and their answer was, that under all the circumstances it would be extremely unadviseable to allow such a person to be at large in Ireland. With this opinion from the law officers in Ireland, and the ministers here, the Irish government felt that they would have incurred a deep responsibility had they complied with the795demand Of the petitioner for unconditional freedom. But as to the charge of severity' in prison, he could assure the house that nothing could be farther, from the disposition and the desire of the Irish government than the wanton oppression of any prisoner. On the contrary, immediately on the arrest of the petitioner special directions were sent to the general commanding the district in which he was imprisoned, that the unfortunate man should be treated with every indulgence that was consistent with the safe custody of his person. Indeed it was remarkable that to none of the generals commanding at Cork, who were directed to inquire into the situation of the prisoner, did the petitioner ever make any complaint of harsh treatment; and he was surprised to see such a complaint in the petition on the table. The right hon. gentleman stated that he should have submitted these observations to the house immediately after he had seen the petition, had he not been prevented by ill health, and he was sorry to observe that an hon. officer (general Tarleton) to whom he could refer upon this subject, was not in his place. The right hon. gent. concluded with again expressing his regret that this business should have been brought forward so late in the session, his wish that it should be fully investigated, and his confidence that the result would completely justify the conduct of the Irish government.", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-wickham-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

He expressed his respect for the opinions already declared by the other house on this subject, and thought the history of the transaction fully justified it. He had no wish to hurt the feelings of any noble lord, but though he was willing to give every credit to the minister, who made the bargain with the house of Atholl. for his desire to save the public money, he must recollect that it was stated that the loss of the public amounted to no less than three hundred and fifty thousand pounds annually from the possession of the royalty of the Isle of Man by the Atholl family. He might, therefore, put it to their lordships, whether there was not a strong claim of justice. He agreed with the noble viscount,in his,desire ,to unite economy-with liberality; but by no means in his application of that rule to the merits of the present case. According to his arguments, there was no ground but fraud on the one side, or fatuity on the other. Such789economy in our generosity as was recommended, came to nothing short of avarice. As to the arguments drawn from the cases Of the duke of Richmond and others, the transactions were different from this: they Were fair and open bargains. They were not questions of dignity, but of plain pounds, shillings, and pence. After several other arguments in support of the bill, he lamented the coarse, harsh, and unnecessary observations, made by the noble and learned lord against the bill, which might surely have been qualified by other expressions. He felt great reverence and respect for high authority, and he felt a jealousy of the effects, opinions delivered in such language, by such authority, might produce. He felt himself, therefore, compelled to complain of the boisterous and rude manner in which&#x2014;[Here lord Ellenborough rose, and observed, that no expressions used by him were such as could justify the application of such terms.] Lord Mulgrave proceeded: He said he should apply to his lordship what one of the characters of our immortal bard, Othello, applied to an old man: \"Signor, your age may more command, me than your weapon.\" He respected his learning, his experience, his authority, and his situation in the state; but his lordship was not to suppose that he and his noble friends on that side of the house were always to sit in silent apathy when he chose to use angry language. Some of the expressions he had used were fitter for demagogues in Palace-yard, who fail at taxes, and introduce every sort of extraneous matter to inflame their audience, than to be used in that house. When he heard irritating and angry language used, it might produce the same sort of language from him; when he heard the word 'job' applied to this measure, he must say he despised the imputation. Such language must always be wrongly used, unless it were intended to follow it up with some positive charge. If a noble person, in a high and venerable situation, did not adapt his expressions to the dignity of that house, nor to the character of his high office, he must feel it due to the dignity of parliament, and due to the character of the bench, to take notice of it, as he felt. Would the noble lord have used such language, in such a stage of a proceeding, in the court in which he presided? He would never submit to be taxed with supporting a 'job'; a conduct of which he knew himself to be incapable. He was really sorry to say so much respecting a noble person of so high a description; but he himself also held a high responsible situation in the conduct of public affairs, and he790thought it justice to himself and others to express his indignation, and to endeavour to set himself right in this point with the house.

His wish was, to do fair justice to the noble duke and to all parties concerned. He considered the compensation question with his mind perfectly unbiassed. He was ready to agree with his noble friends, that if increase of income were taken as the ground, there would be no knowing where to stop: but let noble lords look at the circumstances of the transaction itself. The noble lord then reviewed the case, and observed, that it was evident that the 70,000l.. were taken from a knowledge that that sum was the ultimatum; but it was stated by the Atholl family, that they expected a recommendation to his majesty for some mark of his royal consideration, either by annuity, or in some other way. The question then was, whether what the parties have received, is such as they ought to have taken: and when the difference of the tenure was considered between what was lost and the pension received, he did not think that the latter could be viewed as a sufficient compensation. He did not think the Atholl family had been liberally recompensed. His lordship then alluded to his having been chairman of the committee of the commons on the port of London improvement bill, in which capacity he was led to think a good deal on the subject of compensation ought to be liberal. People ought to be paid for the compulsion imposed upon them. There were some compensations, such as that once proposed in a plan of parliamentary reform, to be given to borough proprietors, to which he could not consent. He could not help thinking that the measure before their lordships was one which was founded in justice. He recollected what had been said by an hon. gent.

If the issue of the debate of the night before last was a mere personal or party triumph; if it was only our own feelings which Were concerned, we might be satisfied, because the noble lord who was the object of the accusation which I had the honour to bring forward, has thought fit to retire from a situation of responsibility, dignity, and emolument, at least from the first situation in point of dignity he held: and as far as any triumph over an individual can be concerned, this has been most complete. But, sir, I was not actuated; and I am sure those Who voted with me on the occasion were not actuated by personal or party motives: I undertook a great cause, in which I had the satisfaction to succeed: I shall not abandon the cause I have undertaken; but I shall still urge the motion of which I gave notice on the former night. If I know any thing of my own heart; if I know any thing of the feelings which actuate me, there is nothing, I trust to God; of, a vindictive spirit within me and having accomplished the end of disclosing the conduct of the noble lord, and having the verdict of the house, I should not, for the mere sake of ulterior punishment, think it necessary to press the subject farther; I should here stop, and desist: but let us consider the situation in which we stand. The noble lord, stigmatized as he is by the vote and proceedings of this house,329has not been dismissed. He has done that which any honourable man may do on feelings of his own. He has tendered his resignation. Is that enough? Lord Melville May be restored to-morrow; he may again be made first lord of the admiralty. Is it fit that should be a possible event? Is it not necessary for the dignity and honour and feelings of this house, than it should be impossible he should be restored to the situation I have described. Reflecting on the proceedings of the other night, I think no man can view them without the deepest gratitude, without experiencing the strongest emotions of joy that such was the event. Many instances have occurred in history where a faction has triumphed over an individual, where persons have been pursued by large majorities of this house; but what is the situation in which we stand? Can there be any page of the journals of parliament which will be looked to in after ages with more pleasure by the true lovers of the country, than the page which records the proceedings of the house on this momentous subject? With an attendance much larger than is usually obtained, the point was equally balanced, and it remained for you, sir, sitting in that seat, which is the seat of impartiality, which is filled, I may say, without paying any undeserved compliment to you, by a person in every respect qualified&#x2014;it remained for you, to whom no party spirit can be imputed, of whom no partiality can possibly be surmised, to decide between the two parties, which was in the right. Your decision did immortal honour to yourself; your decision was looked upon, is looked upon, and ever will be looked upon with joy and satisfaction by the country. The popularity which flows from deeds like these is the greatest satisfaction a man can receive. If we see in all persons whom we meet; if we read in every countenance, in every expression, the congratulation, the self satisfaction; the approbation bestowed on the representatives of the empire&#x2014;if out of this houseWe read our history in a nation's eyes,We have good reason to applaud ourselves; but we shall not have such cause of exultation if we stop here, and do not render it impossible is majesty should ever restore lord Melville. At the same time that I thus express my feelings&#x2014;that I give the house the strong bias of my mind, I mean to speak with an assembly, which has conducted itself with so much honour and respectability, in terms of deference and respect.330If did not think there was a pervading sentiment, that the motion with which I shall conclude would be approved of and adopted, I would not urge it: but from all I have collected, not only from my immediate friends, but from persons divided from that party, with which I am proud to rank myself, and who have opposed that party&#x2014;from what I have heard from every description of persons whose sentiments I have endeavoured to collect, I find a generally prevailing opinion, that it is necessary we should proceed further in this stage of the business. Ulterior proceedings, with reference to others, undoubtedly must be had, and we must tell his majesty in the most solemn way we can, that it is necessary lord Melville should be removed from every office he holds under the crown, and from his majesty's presence and councils for ever. I should like to ask the right hon. gent. opposite me (Mr. Canning) whether some preliminary measures have been taken. Has Mr. Trotter been dismissed? (Mr. Canning answered,yes.) Has Mr. Wilson been dismissed? (Mr. Canning answered,no.) If not, then I say all that is necessary to be done has not been done. There may be particular circumstances, and I am far from meaning to say they do not exist, which may make it necessary to retain such a person as Mr. Wilson in office a few days. Is it the right hon. gent.'s intention to dismiss him? (No answer.) Then I say he ought to be dismissed from his office. He is not fit to hold a situation in the Navy Office, or any other office under government? Yet, even if both are dismissed, ulterior Proceedings must be had; and, in order that it may not be necessary for me again to trouble the house, I take this opportunity of giving notice, that it is my intention, immediately after the holidays, to move that his majesty's attorney-general be instructed to proceed against lord Melville and Mr. Trotter, for an account, in order that (agreeing as I do with the commissioners of naval inquiry) the public may receive back what has been unjustly taken from the public purse, and that the profits so unduly made may be refunded. The way of obtaining restitution I shall leave in the hands of the hon. and learned gent. There are other proceedings necessary to be adopted, in consequence of the Tenth Report, even if the question I shall propose to day should be carried. That it will be carried I can entertain no doubt; it would indeed be an inauspicious dawn of our labours, if the house should331reject it. I hope and trust that the career of that sun, which has just begun to diffuse its warmth and nourish the hopes of the country, will be brilliant, and when it sets, that it will set in glory. It will be necessary that all the proceedings, both of lord Melville and Mr. Trotter, should be enquired into and sifted. The time is come in which I shall, as it is my duty, propose every practicable enquiry. With regard to that part of the subject which you have already investigated, no enquiry could have made it clearer; but there are other matters contained in the report which are dark and mysterious. On them I must throw a light. It was my intention to have proposed a resolution with regard to the transfer of the public money from one service to another, in violation of the law, but I collected from gentlemen with whom I conversed, that those transfers might have been made without such evil intention as I attributed to them. To one transfer the right hon. gent. opposite me has acknowledged he was privy. The transfers might all of them have been honourable. I shall proceed, in conformity with the wish of the house; but it may be necessary for me to mention, that it is my intention, after the holidays, to move for a select committee, to enquire into all the transactions referred to in the report; for I am convinced, no subject of deeper moment can come under the consideration of the house. It appears by the report, that money voted for particular services has been applied to other services. What a precedent does this set up? What a door does it open to fraud? During the whole of the treasurership which preceded, and during the whole which succeeded lord Melville's treasurership, no negotiation of this kind was ever found necessary. It was only during the administration of lord Melville that any such practices were ever carried on in the treasurership of the navy office, according to all the accounts we have of the manner business was transacted. In the course of these transactions a particular circumstance will come to the recollection of the house. What I allude to is, the papers recording them having been destroyed, papers which ought to have been carefully preserved. If such transactions as are stated in the report took place, they ought to have been secretly recorded, in order that, if innocent, the justification of those concerned might appear; or, if guilty, that they might be condemned. There are other parts of the Tenth Report which it may be necessary to refer to a committee,332as well as other circumstances not included in the report. I adverted on a former evening to the conduct of the bank, and meant to have returned to it, but my recollection failed me. Upon the evidence of the chief cashier of the bank, it appeared the bank had not sufficient vouchers for the money issued. I have been given to understand, that the evidence was not correct, but that the bank were correct. If that is the case, let it be set right. Do not let the imputation remain on the bank, if it is an unjust one. In the course of what I offered to the house the other evening, I intimated, from conversation and rumour, which I stated to have been founded on accurate information, that the right hon. gent (Mr. Pitt) was not without blame, I do repeat that charge, and it remains for him to exculpate himself. If he cannot do so now, I shall move for that part of the subject being referred to a committee. I do charge, that he was apprized of the irregular mode of taking the money out of the Bank of England, and placing it in a private, bank. The rumour is, that he was acquainted, from the most direct and authentic source, and that as prime minister and chief financial officer of the country he took no step to prevent it. This is a point which must also be referred to the committee. There are other circumstances, particularly the circumstance which relates to Mr. Jellicoe. This is one of the strongest features of the case, and has made a strong impression on the public, and every person who has heard of it. It is not only lord Melville who is accused, but the commissioners of the treasury. It will be for them to shew upon what ground they granted aquietusto Mr. Jellico, to the amount of 24,000l. To persons who are in the habit of constantly talking of millions, tens of millions, fifties, and hundreds of millions, and who could make a mistake in supposing that to be 186 millions which was only 134 millions; the sum I have mentioned may appear trifling; but I wish to know why aquietuswas given for 24,000l. If it was only for 24 pence, the grounds ought to be enquired into I believe it will be found, that the lords of the treasury were to blame, and that it was obtained under false pretences.&#x2014;Lastly, sir, there is a circumstance on which it is particularly important the house should have information, if it can be obtained. How it is to be obtained I do not know; but things often come to light which we despair of developing. The most important point333on which I dwelt so long the other night, both as it affects the public and lord Melville, as well as his connections, is, whether he was or was not a participator in the peculations charged against Mr. Trotter. That fact is material to be ascertained, and if it is possible, the commissioners will ascertain it. The suspicious circumstances I stated on the last night&#x2014;they have made a deep impression on my mind, and there has been no denial of them.&#x2014;It is stated, by Dr. Swift, that two and two do not always make four. I am sure, according to lord Melville, four and four were not always equal. His lordship had, as the salary of his office, 4,000l. a year; no duties attached to it, but it was clear of all deduction. We heard lord Melville state how he was oppressed by public business, that he had hardly time to rest at night; but that it was necessary for the administration of public affairs they should not be entrusted to other hands than his own; that it was necessary he should continue to be president of the board of control; and that he should have the management of the war. But was it necessary too that he should be treasurer of the navy? Undoubtedly there were always persons willing to receive the emoluments of office without doing the duty as well as his lordship. What does lord Melville do? He gives up 4,000l. a year of his income, as secretary of state, and takes 4,000l. as treasurer of the navy. What does this prove, but that the one was better than the other; that the one promised to yield more in future, that the one was male, and the other female, the one fruitful, the other not; that the one produced only 4,000l. a year, and the other was productive of a great deal more. This is what, on reflection, more and more strengthens my suspicions, for suspicions I admit they are, and must be till they are confirmed: but whether they are confirmed or not, perhaps I do not feel that they Constitute the principal article of charge. The principal article of charge has been substantiated, has been acknowledged by the noble lord himself, under his own hand, and out of his Own mouth; the house of commons has decided on it, and where there is ground of suspicion that he has swerved one hair's breadth, one scruple beyond his duty, it is necessary for the dignity of the house of commons, and for the satisfaction of the people of this empire that he should not again execute his office, and that others should be deterred from acting in the same334way. With this view, I shall move an humble address to his Majesty, praying his majesty to remove lord Melville from his councils for ever, and from all offices held during pleasure of the crown. The noble lord is not the only one by many who has given in his resignation to his majesty. The right hon. gent. opposite has heretofore done the same. But if lord Melville is suffered to retire with his dignities and riches, his resignation will not afford a satisfaction to public justice; and beyond that I do not wish to proceed. As to the punishment the noble lord, if the public Was not concerned, I would say, \"go forth, let us hear of you no more.\" That which he has suffered by the disgraceful situation he has exposed himself to, is infinitely more than I wish him to feel: but the end of punishment is example, and unless he is punished beyond what he has already suffered, he is not sufficiently punished. We know that lord Melville, down to a very late period, has had the confidence of the crown; that the confidence of the crown has been expressed towards him so strongly, that, since the last administration, an addition of 1,500l. a year for life has been conferred on him. It is on the table, printed and known to the whole world, that after lord Melville's having retired to Scotland, I should have supposed for life, he was&#x2014;by the exigencies of the country? no, but by the circumstances of the right hon. gent. opposite, called from his retirement, and given a situation of the greatest responsibility the crown had to give, except that which the right hon. gent. himself holds. He was to receive the emoluments of such office. That was not enough; he was to have 1,500l. a year more. That was not enough; for in case he retired, he was to have a grant for life&#x2014;a patent office; for so long as he should hold the privy seal of Scotland he was to have 1,500l, a year. That is a man therefore under no ordinary circumstances. At the time of this advance, which perhaps it may be necessary to enquire into, there was also a grant to lady Melville of 1,500l. a year of the money of the public, for which no service has been rendered, granted, if not in a clandestine manner, at least in a way that those who affixed the seal to the patent did not understand the nature of it. What office lord Melville holds during pleasure, besides the one which he has resigned, I do not know; I do not know that a pension of the kind I have stated can be valid; or whether, supposing a ser-335vant of the crown to have misconduct himself, such a pension may not be revokable? If it is, it ought to be revoked; if it is not, so much more the pity. Having taken up more of the time of the house than I at first intended, I shall not longer intrude upon their attention, meaning to conduct myself as becomes me towards the members of the house, and particularly those who agreed with me, and trusting that those who disagreed with me on a former evening, will agree with me this night, because there may be many who will now imagine, that the house, having come to the resolutions founded on the report, ought not to stop short, and may therefore concur with me in the vote that lord Melville should be removed from his majesty's councils. In this hope, and with this view, and not meaning to be led away by my own suggestions, unless they should be supported by the house, and without any desire of pressing the house to a division, if it should appear that it is not actuated by sentiments similar to my own, I shall conclude by moving, \"That an humble address be presented to his majesty, praying that his majesty will be graciously pleased to remove lord viscount Melville from all offices held under the crown during pleasure, and from his councils and presence for ever.\"&#x2014;The question being put,", "author_id": "/people/mr-samuel-whitbread-2", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1805", "oct", "10"], "content": "&#x2014;I rise, sir, under no inconsiderable share of embarrassment. I was in some doubt, whether I should take notice of the observations of the right hon. gent. at all. It is indeed, unpleasant to me at all times to enter into any thing in this house where I am personally concerned. With regard to whatever I or my hon. relation have done, I do not feel that we have merited the reproof of the right hon. gent., since I do believe we neither of us have any obligation to confess to the zeal, impartiality, or ability of the noble lord. The right hon. gent. accuses me for the warmth I have displayed respecting this business, and in answer to this accusation it is only necessary to say, that I am quite unconscious of any such bitterness, and it would, I think, be rather difficult for the right hon. gent. to shew in what way it has been evinced. He chooses to congratulate me and my hon. friend near me (Mr. Whitbread) on our more than Spartan virtue in voting against the noble lord, who, as he alleges, was the champion of those who are dear to us by the ties of blood or the connexions of friendship. He tells us that the battle which the noble lord fought for these relations was disinterested, and he admires the return we have made for these magnanimous exertions. This, sir, is a strange kind of language; but it will be proper for me to call the attention of the house to the circumstances to which the right hon. gent. has alluded. It is sufficiently in the recollection of the house that these noble lords being in the service of government, received only bare justice from the ministers of the day. It will be recollected that among the few instances of military glory which distinguished the late war, the two noble lords, triumphing over difficulties of a very formidable nature, had eminently distinguished themselves. On their return to this country from the West Indies, some dissatisfaction arose, and an inquiry was proposed by some members of this house. What was the conduct of these noble persons on that occasion? Did they fly from justice? Did they wish to elude inquiry, or did they discover any anxiety to conceal their conduct behind any mean or dishonourable subterfuge? On the contrary, did they not court inquiry? Did342they not call for the fullest investigation of every part of their conduct, and appeal to the fair decision of the house? The right hon. gent. has spoken as if those noble persons received favours from the noble lord who appeared in their defence; but I utterly disclaim the existence of any such favours. The noble lord defended them because they had served with credit and honour those by whom they were employed. This sort of justice was due, not merely to their particular merits, but it was due to the country whose interests they had promoted. Will the right hon. gent. opposite, who, on the occasion when the motion for an inquiry was brought forward, moved the amendment, say, that he did not seriously believe that the charge was unfounded&#x2014;will he say that he was not convinced that their conduct, so far from being liable to censure, was entitled to the highest approbation and gratitude? Am I then to be told that the noble lord who appeared in defence of the noble lords was conferring a favour on them, or any of those with whom they were connected? Am I to hold myself under obligations to the noble lord for a defence of those gallant officers, whom he himself had employed, and who had signalized themselves in the public service? The right hon. gent., however, takes some merit to the noble lord for employing those who were known not to be in all cases favourable to the administration of that period. Without dwelling on this point, or ascertaining how far the noble lords at that time differed from ministers, it is sufficient for me to say, that to employ naval and military men of all different parties, is no proof of the moderation of ministers. They are compelled, whether they will or not, to employ the Services of those who are distinguished by their talents or their experience, and the minister who would act otherwise would soon find that he could not long persevere in arrangements utterly repugnant both to the feelings of this house and the country. It is hardly possible to conceive ministers guilty of a greater crime than refusing the services of persons of known talents, and to whose employment the only existing objection is some differences of political opinion. But the right hon. gent. has represented the defence of those noble persons as a work of great difficulty. It is of consequence to see, then, how the case really stands. Why, sir as nearly as I can recollect, though I do not remember what was the majority, only sixteen members, that is the odd numbers on the di-343vision of Monday, could be found to support that charge now represented as so formidable. The case was one of the plainest and least intricate that can be supposed, and, therefore, the noble lord's defence was, in point of difficulty, trifling, and, in point of Justice, the noble lords had a right to expect it from those who employed them. I have been obliged to say so much on this topic, for, after what fell from the right hon. gent., it was quite impossible for me to have remained silent. Indeed, the right hon. gent 's allusion to this business was equally ill judged and impolitic. It was calculated to excite unpleasant feelings, without at all advancing that cause which he affected to support. The right hon. gent. has alluded to the warmth with which the noble lord has been attacked; but, really, I am at a loss to discover where the least evidence of it has been exhibited. I have felt no personal warmth or vindictive spirit on the subject, and I am sure no part of the conduct of my hon. friend has betrayed any appearance of a rancorous spirit. I have supported my hon. friend from a sense of duty, and I only regret that I have been prevented from taking that share in the discussion which I could have wished. The right hon. gent. talks of rancour, of which no trace has appeared; but though there has been no rancour, it was impossible not to feel strong indignation when instances of strong delinquency were discovered. My hon. friend urged these delinquencies, with that force which was peculiar to himself; but he never resorted to asperity of observation. He wished only the ends of justice to be fulfilled; but when his object is accomplished, I am sure that my hon. friend will never think for a moment of vindictive measures of punishment. It is with a view to have these ends of justice satisfied that the motion of my hon. friend has this evening been brought forward; but he has declared that if a satisfactory assurance is given that lord Melville has closed his political life, he has no wish to press the motion at the present moment. This surely is no evidence of rancour, of Which the right hon. gent. speaks so loudly in his speech. As to the necessity of the motion I have no sort of hesitation in saying, that unless something is added to the resolution on Monday night, they are left incomplete. After saying that the noble lord had been guilty of a gross violation of an act of parliament, and a high breach of his duty, we shall not discharge our duty to the country without following up such resolu-344tions by some corresponding measures. Without some others it is almost a nullity to suffer the resolutions of Monday to remain on the journals of the house. My hon. friend has said, and has said with truth, that the notification of the resignation of the noble lord by the right hon. gent. is far from satisfying either the house or the country. The resignation of the noble lord, at another period, might have been very proper, but under the present circumstances of the country, his mere resignation of his situation as first lord of the admiralty is far from coming up to the spirit of those resolutions which will afford such general satisfaction in every part of the empire. Lord Melville's resignation after the resolutions of Monday was altogether a matter of course. Neither he nor any other man dared to have continued in power after the opinion of this house was so solemnly and so beneficially expressed. The resignation has taken place; but what security have we obtained that he may not, in a very short time, be recalled to a very confidential situation under the crown? The house will bear in mind that the noble lord still continues a privy counsellor, and one part of my hon. friend's motion is, that he be dismissed, not only from his majesty's councils, but from his presence for ever. It is not at the same time to be forgotten that the noble lord at this time is actually in possession of several lucrative offices held during pleasure; and I do not think that, after the resolutions we have passed, his removal from these would be at all carrying punishment to an improper length. After the declarations we have made, can we take any precautions too strong to insure the object which the majority of the house professed to have in view? The right hon. gent. rests a great deal on delicacy, as an argument for resisting my hon. friend's motion. I, sir, am a friend to delicacy, where it can be exercised consistently with justice; but I can never accede to a proposition for screening convicted guilt from adequate punishment, by any scruples which false delicacy would impose. With a wish then that our resolutions should not be evaded, but carried into the fullest effect, I should certainly be desirous of seeing my hon. friend's motion adopted, as at once the most consistent with our honour, most agreeable to the calls of justice, most consonant to the expectations of the country. I shall say only a few words on some other topics which the right hon. gent. has thought fit to introduce into his speech. The right hon. gent has spoken of345the arbitrary and despotic doctrines brought forward by my hon. and learned relation behind me (Mr. George Ponsonby); but as my hon. and learned relation is himself so competent, it is not necessary for me to trouble you with many observations. But I may just be permitted to ask, whether there be any thing extraordinary or inconsistent with justice, any thing inconsistent with the character of a British lawyer, any thing at all tyrannical or despotic, in having a person accused of a most aggravated crime secured previous to his trial? Could this be called a prejudging of the cause? As well might we be accused of prejudging a criminal, because we found it necessary to shut him up in a prison previous to the proofs of his guilt being fully or fairly considered. Here, however, we were talking of a person not accused, but found guilty. I put it to the house, whether, after the circumstances of Trotter's conduct were known, it was at all decent to employ him in a situation which he had previously employed to the most improper purposes. If Trotter was not dismissed, he ought surely to have been suspended from his office, till the inquiry in this house was closed. The right hon. gent. has advanced nothing to shew that it was not his duty to have followed this course. His whole speech, indeed, was nothing but idle rant and fury, containing nothing addressed to the reason of the house, nothing which affords the least proof that the motion of my hon. friend should not be adopted, as the natural consequence of the previous resolutions. Conceiving, then, this to be the, case, I shall support the motion as called for by every principle of honour, every demand of justice, and every feeling of regard for our character.", "author_id": "/people/mr-charles-grey-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1805", "oct", "10"], "content": "&#x2014;Mr. Speaker; after being so pointedly and personally alluded to by the right hon. gent., I hope I shall be favoured with the attention of the house for a few a moments. Since first I had the honour of a seat in this house, I will not attempt to deny that it has ever been my ardent wish to stand high in the esteem of all the members of whom it is composed. After the vote of Monday, however, a vote so honourable to the character of this assembly, a vote which has exalted its character among all orders in the state who value independence and worth, I confess, that to stand well in your opinion has become a matter of the utmost anxiety. The right hon. gent. has chosen to say, that if I had been a British lawyer I never could possibly346have brought forward those tyrannical, despotic, and oppressive doctrines which he supposes me to have delivered. Of having uttered any such language as could convey the idea of arbitrary principles or practices, I am utterly unconscious. I was followed by a right hon. gent. who is unquestionably one of the most sound and constitutional lawyers, and a judge in one of the highest courts in the kingdom, and it is rather, remarkable that he took not the least notice of these supposed arbitrary doctrines, though he did me the honour to allude to several parts of my speech. If such doctrines had been contained in what I then advanced, it is next to impossible that they should have escaped the observation of his penetrating and comprehensive mind. If I did lay down arbitrary doctrines, they are the same doctrines which many of the most eminent lawyers that this country ever saw have not scrupled to avow. The right hon. gent. however, tells me that if I were a British lawyer, I could not possibly avow the principles he imputes to me. I am not ashamed at any time, sir, or under any circumstances, of my country, and I hope I shall never be guilty of an action which will give my country cause to be ashamed of me. As, however, the right hon. gent. rests so much on my not being a British lawyer, I beg leave to inform him, that I have as good British blood flowing in my veins as the right hon. gent. can boast of in his. I cannot boast of having arrived at so early a period of life as the right hon. gent. at the honours and rewards which the right hon. gentleman now enjoys. What I have earned of honours and rewards have been the result of long labours and painful exertion; but this I can safely assure the house that never till now have I been accused of being an arbitrary or unconstitutional lawyer. I said, sir, alluding to the case of Mr. Trotter, that circumstances had been disclosed which shewed that he ought not to have employed in the office of paymaster of the navy, and I am still of the same opinion. But on what principle is it that the right hon. gent. accuses this declaration as inconsistent with the principles of justice? What are these principles? they are plainly these:&#x2014; that Mr. Trotter had, by his own evidence, proved his guilt; and that the testimony of his friend and patron, lord Melville, instead of weakening, strengthened this opinion. I ask, then, after such evidence was given before the commissioners, if it would have been at all extraordinary or unjust to have347suspended Mr. Trotter till his innocence or guilt was fully ascertained? I say, in such a suspension there was no prejudice. There was, on the contrary, that strict regard to the proper application of the public money, with which the employment of a person even suspected of malversation does not appear to me to be very consistent. If the right hon. member had acted in this way I am fully sensible that neither the house nor the country would have blamed him for his arbitrary or despotic proceedings. I entertain a sincere respect for the right hon. gentleman's talents. Indeed it is not conceivable that without great talents he should, at so early a period of life, have risen to that elevation in the state in which he is now placed. With all my respect for his abilities, however, I must insist, that when he next honours my observations with his notice, he will take a little pains to state accurately what I say, for I protest, with all my esteem for his talents, I should not relish the idea of his making speeches for me.&#x2014; Having said this with respect to the arbitrary doctrines of which he accuses me, I shall, before I sit down say a few words on the general question before the house. My hon. friend seems to me to have framed his motion on the most consistent principles. He very properly says, that though the right hon. gent. opposite (Mr. Pitt) has intimated to us the resignation of lord Melville's situation of first lord of the admiralty, he has not told us, what is much more important, what is much more intimately connected with the resolutions of Monday night, that lord Melville has closed his political life; that he is never more to have any share in the administration of the affairs of this great empire. We all know what are the connections of the noble lord, how far extended are the resources of his influence. None of us are ignorant how intimately he possesses the confidence of the ministers of the crown, and how anxious they, would, at any time, be to receive his advice and support. We have, independent of a motion similar to that of my hon. friend, no security against his return to power, a thing totally inconsistent with the resolutions of Monday, and which would render them mere wastes paper on the journals. But even admitting that lord Melville did normally retire, let it be kept in mind that he still continues a privy councellor, as my hon. friend below me (Mr. Grey) has already very properly remarked. While the connection of the noble lord with the administration of the348country continues such as it now is, I profess that I am not satisfied that we have gained what our grand struggle of Monday so justly entitled us to expect. Let me suppose that this intimacy continues, and that the minister employs his influence to misrepresent and vilify the decisions of this house. Let me suppose that the press is hired into the service, and that the public are told, in publication after publication, by the friends and creatures of ministers, that lord Melville has been run down by a desperate faction in this house&#x2014;that he has been condemned unheard&#x2014;that he offered to call evidence to prove the falsity of the accusations against him, but was refused&#x2014;that, in short, he is a much persecuted, and much injured man. Let me suppose that, by these delusions, the strong sentiments of honourable indignation which now actuate the public mind are a good deal deadened, and that the minister, availing himself of these favourable changes should, during the recess of parliament, venture on the daring measure of once more recommending lord Melville to the service of his sovereign, and that his majesty, fatally yielding to this recommendation, should once more receive him into his councils. Let me suppose this, which is not by any means an impossible case, and what then is to become of all our resolutions, of all our efforts to stem the growth of corruption, of all our exertions to bring peculators, however elevated their rank, or extensive their influence, to an ignominious punishment? It is to guard equally against this and any similar case that I am inclined to support the motion of my hon. friend. The right hon. gent. strongly recommends to us the propriety of leniency in our proceedings; I am no enemy to leniency when properly exerted, and I have no wish that the noble lord should be treated with unnecessary severity; but, before I can be lenient, I must know that the cause of public justice is secure. I must be satisfied that the noble lord shall not again have it in his power to have any weight in our national councils. I wish to have the public money placed safely beyond the reach of the corrupt and profligate. I am willing to shew as much tenderness as possible to the noble lord, though I confess I never had the honour to exchange one word with him in the whole course of my life; but I shall be a party in lenity to no man till I have provided against peculation among great public men. I am clear, sir, for making every public delinquent refund what he has un-349justly obtained out of the public purse, and I shall certainly support my hon. friend in all his motions for carrying through this glorious work of reform. While I shall support the motions for calling lord Melville and Mr. Trotter to a strict account, I shall be equally a friend to any investigation of the control exercised by the treasury over the inferior offices. It is the duty of the treasury to see that negligence and waste do not exist in the inferior departments. I do not impute corrupt practices to the right hon. gent. at the head of the treasury, for I do not like to impute corruption to any one without strong evidence; but I do see from the report, that the superintendance of the treasury has, in many instances, been criminally relaxed. The rank of the commissioners is not to screen them from inquiry; and I trust the future proceedings of the house will fully prove the truth of this opinion. Though I am a representative for another part of the kingdom, I shall feel no hesitation in saying that I consider myself as much a representative for Great Britain as for Ireland, and on all occasions shall endeavour to act on this liberal principle. If the motion is persisted in, it certainly shall have my cordial vote.", "author_id": "/people/mr-george-ponsonby-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

That officer (Mr. Newland) had there intimated that the drafts passed by the treasurer had not always expressed the service on which they were drawn, conformably to the provisions of the act of parliament. If this were the case, the bank were certainly to blame, as he held in his hand a copy of the power under which the paymaster had passed his drafts from the year 1786 until the resignation of lord Melville; this power stated in express words, \"that he should be particularly careful to specify in each and every draft the service for which the money was drawn.\" The fact was, that Mr. Newland, though at the head of the cashier's department of the bank, was not the officer under whose inspection the detail of this branch of business was carried on, and therefore had only delivered a matter of opinion. The officer who paid the drafts from the350navy office had assured the hon. member, that after every research in his power, and to the best of his recollection, no draft had ever been paid without specifying the service. Since August, 1803, the mode of conducting the business had been varied, and sums were written off at once by the bank from the treasurer's account to that of the sub-paymasters of the navy, which accounts were kept also with that corporation.&#x2014;The hon. gent. mentioned that allusions had been made to certain communications in which he was reported to be a party: but herein he begged to set the house right, and, as far as respected him, he could assure them they were founded in mistake. What might have passed with any other gentlemen they could themselves best explain. With respect to Mr. Trotter and Mr. Wilson, every apprehension that they could any longer abuse the confidence of their employer, or misapply the public money, were at an end. The right hon. gent. (Mr. Canning) had sent an order this morning to the bank, prohibiting any money being given to any person connected with the navel department, without a draft signed by himself.&#x2014;The hon. gent. said, that he had voted in favour of the resolutions, because he thought it his duty, because the noble lord, in his opinion, had committed abuses; but he was unwilling to go farther till he should obtain more evidence than the house had yet before them of the motives from which that noble lord had acted. That his lordship had permitted the commission of abuses he was ready to admit, and had voted accordingly, but that his conduct had proceeded from corrupt motives, he thought remained to be proved; and notwithstanding, therefore, the vote he had given on Monday night, he could by no means go along with the hon. gent. in his motion of to-night. He could not help recollecting how long the noble lord had been an able and active servant of the public. From this recollection, he had given his former vote with regret; and, from the same circumstance, could not be induced to go farther, unless from the most positive evidence of the corrupt intention of the noble lord, which evidence was not at present of such a nature as to justify any farther they proceedings.", "author_id": "/people/mr-samuel-thornton", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

The vote he had given on Monday night had been purely disinterested, and had not arisen from the influence of any party. He disapproved of the abuses that had taken place, and had voted accordingly. He would take the liberty, however, though unconnected with any party, to recommend to the hon. gent. not to persist in his present motion. Was the hon. gent. certain that the circumstance of the case, taken in the whole, would warrant such a measure? At any rate, he thought it extremely ill-timed; and the same sense of duty that had prompted him to vote with the hon. gent. on Monday night would also induce him to resist the present motion. The design of the adjournment on the former night, was avowedly to decline any measure on the part of the house till they should see if his majesty would, from the suggestions of his own royal breast, take any step that might supersede the necessity of any further operations on the part of the house. The result had been favourable to the wishes of the house, and had rendered, in his opinion, this measure unnecessary. But why, he asked, such eagerness to follow up the blow that had been already give? for this, he understood, was but a part of the measures that were intended to be adopted, and that other en-352quiries were also to be instituted. He should be told that it was to prevent the noble lord from ever again returning to his majesty's councils; but there was no probability, in his opinion, that he would again be restored. Indeed, he said, it might not be impossible but farther inquiries might lead to discoveries that might render an impeachment necessary. He did not by any means say that such would be the effect of farther inquiry, but that such might be the effect was not impossible. Should such, however, be the effect, it would then be time enough to have recourse to such measures, for at present he deemed them premature. It had been said, that the resolutions of the former night would prove ineffectual, would be attended with no material advantage, unless followed up by a measure of the description of that proposed by the hon. gent.; but it was generally understood that night, he contended, when those resolutions passed, that no farther measures were to be adopted. Had this motion immediately followed the resolutions, it might have been considered as a necessary corollary to those resolutions, and might, as such, have met his support; but the necessity of the measure no longer existed. The step proposed to the house was, besides, contrary to all the precedents with which he was acquainted. So far as his knowledge or experience extended, it never had been the usage of the house to address his majesty against persons out of office. Such was the case in respect to sir Robert Walpole, lord Ranelagh, and others whom the hon. gent. mentioned, against whom no address of removal had been presented to his majesty, though previously perhaps in the contemplation of parliament, when no longer in office. Indeed the very idea was sufficiently absurd, because it was not possible to remove from office those who were in no office. At all events, if the matter was to undergo a full discussion, as intimated by the hon. gent., he would much rather delay any farther proceedings till the result of those inquiries should be ascertained. When the house should have the whole before them, they could then more justly estimate the degree of odium that was to be attached to a conduct which, though irregular, and in violation of an act of parliament, might yet admit of many circumstances of mitigation. In such a discovery he declared he would have much more pleasure than he experienced before in the vote he gave in favour of the resolutions.", "author_id": "/people/mr-henry-bankes", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

If the qualification proposed could be acceded to, consistently with the feelings of the house, the motion made by his hon. friend should not be brought forward. What gentlemen would have agreed to on the last night was exactly the same they were so desirous to put off this night. The only object was to ascertain whether the proceeding recommended was in substance the same as the motion, which was more consistent with the custom and regular from of the house. He censured those who had recourse to argument founded on delicacy and soft sentiment, which should never be introduced or countenanced in a grave assembly. He was less interested for the noble lord from private motives than many others, though he was not uninterested. But when that interest was made use of to influence the decision of a question, of which was the best mode for the house to do its duty, he could not listen to it. If this resolution was a necessary corollary the other night, he saw no reason why it should not be a necessary corollary now. The motion went far beyond what had done, inasmuch as what had been done was no security for the perpetual exclusion of the noble lord, though it was to be expected he would not be reinstated. The only excuse that could be offered to the public for not following up the resolution agreed to on the other night was, that in the progress of the future investigation matter of extenuation may come out. He did not think that could be. He thought the house justified in the vote of the last night, because the whole of the case was before them. If he did not think so, God forbid that he should object to any thing that could place the case in a fuller or purer view! There was nothing to impeach the decision then made on the fairest motives: he should, therefore, require a promise or declaration, which would render it impossible to restore lord Melville. Otherwise, he had such a hold of those who were in power; they were so linked and connected together, that an attempt may be made to counteract what the house had done. One instance was well Known, in which, after a censure more strong than that now passed upon lord Melville, the noble person recovered his situation, and the highest honours of the country were showered on him. What the house pronounced in its354best judgement should therefore not be given up under less than an express pledge for what was implied in the resolution of the former night. It was, therefore, necessary to follow up the resolutions, in order to have security for the future. A right hon. gent. (Mr. Canning) had said, that it ought to be a rule not to proceed with passion and violence; a good rule, certainly; but extremely ill observed on the part of the right hon. gent himself. Had they gone beyond the line? If they had, let it be shewn by argument, and let it not rest upon the intemperate assertions of the right hon. gent. Parliament had made a great effort, such a one as, he was persuaded, would entitle them to the thanks and gratitude of the whole kingdom; he wished that they should continue those efforts; he wished to take security against their falling off. It would be a lamentable instance of the mutability of opinion, if they should forfeit, by indifference or langour, the high honours which their conduct on the preceding evening had obtained them from all sorts of people, honours \"which should be worn now in their newest gloss.\" The right hon. gent. had indulged him self in the use of some strong expressions against the force of popular prejudice and clamour; in that he fully coincided with him. To yield upon any occasion to public clamour, so far as to condemn any one upon it, would be, in his opinion, one of the meanest and most unjust acts of which a deliberative body could be capable. But as the noble lord had not, as he would contend, been condemned under the influence of public clamour, he conceived it the duty of the house to proceed and follow up their resolutions of Monday, by agreeing to the motion of his hon. friend. Leaving out of the question all idea of participation in the profits derived from the use of the public monies, and looking to the abstract crime, the bare and naked violation of an act of parliament, still he would maintain, that the house was in duty bound, if they valued consistency, if they valued the maintenance of their own honour, to proceed and to pass the motion made by his hon. friend as a necessary inference and corollary from the resolutions to which they had agreed on Monday. Gentlemen would do well to recollect, that they were not in a court of strict judicial proceedings, in a court where the interest, the honour, and the feelings of the people were to be considered. They were not to be fettered by the ordinary maxims of the judicial tribunals,355but the privileges of parliament were to be asserted by them in that mode which they thought most likely to establish and preserve them. The noble lord was undoubtedly carus amicis, and, he had no objection that he should long remain so; but it was as true, that he was no longer idoneus patri&#x00E6; and, therefore, he thought it necessary that the house should declare so. If it was understood that the noble lord should not be appointed to any place of trust and confidence, as long as the resolutions agreed to on Monday remained on the journals, that may be urged as an argument against the adoption of his hon. friend's motion; but, after what had passed, it was his opinion that the house if it wished to be consistent with itself should agree to the motion foran address to his majesty.", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-windham-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1805", "oct", "10"], "content": "began by adverting to the manner in which the motion had been spoken of by the hon. gent (Mr. Banks) on the same bench. The hon. gent. allowed that the present motion was a corollary from the resolution of Monday, and declared that if it had been put from the chair immediately after the other resolutions were passed, he must in consistency have given it his support. He wished to know, why he might not equally vote for the motion now, since whatever argument existed for the motion at that time, remained now in full force? The only reason which induced a postponement of the motion then, was the lateness of the hour, and that was the only consideration which induced him to recommend to his hon. friend not to submit his motion till the next meeting of the house. He had frequently seen and complained of the inconveniencies of hurrying through important motions at a very late hour, and as some debate was naturally to be expected on so interesting a subject, he was anxious that every gentleman should have an opportunity of delivering his sentiments. He had said, that among other advantages which would attend the delay would be that of giving the ministry an opportunity of properly performing their duty; but he never even hinted that the identical motion which his hon. friend now submitted to the house would not be brought forward. If the support of the hon. gent. to the bill was, therefore, now lost, it was entirely lost, because his hon. friend and himself had proceeded on a pledge that the motion would be adapted as an obvious corollary from the Resolutions, and that, viewing it in this light, they had yielded to the argumentum ad vericundiam&#x2014;After these introductory observations, Mr. Fox\n            proceeded in substance as follows:&#x2014;The right hon.\n            gent. who spoke second in the debate, has delivered himself in a manner so extraordinary and injudious, that it is really hardly worth while to take notice of his observation. The resolutions of the house on Monday night, seem so completely357to have irritate the right hon. gent. and, so fully to have overpower his mind, that he has his evening taken an opportunity of throwing forth his indignation without providing himself with grounds on which to exercise it. He has chosen to attack, without the slightest appearance of truth, my learned and hon. friend (Mr. G. Ponsonby) as the author of arbitrary and despotic doctrines, and on this I shall not long detain the house after what my learned and hon. friend has said, in so satisfactory a manner. The right hon. gent. accuses my hon. and learned friend of arbitrary doctrines, because he says, that a person proved by evidence to have been guilty of a most corrupt use of the public money, should at least be suspended from his office till the charges against him be fully investigated. Now, all that I have to say on this is, simply, that it such doctrine be arbitrary, the most eminent lawyers in the kingdom have never been backward to promulgate it. It is a doctrine universally acknowledged and acted on in all the relations of life. When we hear or read of a servant, or a steward suspected of peculation or any other breach of trust, and not merely suspected, but actually confessing guilt, we of course order them to quit the office where the grounds of\n            suspicion arose, conceiving that persons so situated are utterly unworthy of trust. But, perhaps the right hon. gent. meant to take up the business of the Tenth Report, and was therefore unwilling to incur the charge of prejudice by the discharge of Mr. Trotter before the trial took place. Under what circumstances is it that the right hon. gent. determined to retain Mr. Trotter in the important office of paymaster of the navy? He had heard that before the commissioners be refused in some cases to answer questions at all, and in others had given equivocating replies. He had heard that he not only refused to answer questions to which, supposing him innocent, the reply was quite obvious, but he had known Mr. Trotter to have used every effort to retard the investigation of the commissioners, and after all this previous knowledge, the right hon. gent. retains him in his employment paymaster. What then, is the reason for this most extraordinary conduct? It is, sir, that hon. Trotter's case wassub judice, and the right hon. gent. does not wish to prejudge him on his trial. The right hon. gent has this evening declared a Trotter is dismissed, when he is as muchsub judiceas he has been at any period since the commissions finished their exa-358mination. Mr. Trotter has not been formally condemned by the house, for we have found him guilty only collaterally, our resolution on Monday evening being exclusively directed against lord Melville. Perhaps, sir, the right hon gent. was alarmed by the impression made by our proceedings, (and they were well calculated to make an impression on persons like the right hon. gent.,) and by a sudden impulse of feeling thought it most prudent to discharge Mr. Trotter without further delay. I cannot impute this decision to any other principle, for ail the reasons that operated for retaining Trotter for several months back still continue in force.&#x2014;The next feature in the very extraordinary speech of the right hon. gent. were the arguments he used for the lenient application of our resolutions against lord Melville, and the circumstances on which this lenity is to be founded. Perhaps, in what I am now about to say, the right hon. gent. may think me bitter and rancorous, but, in spite of this, I feel myself called on to say that I shall never sit in this house and patiently hear these extravagant panegyrics on lord Melville's public conduct. I am at a loss where to find what are the circumstances which are to incline us so powerfully to mercy. What particular claims does he possess to induce the house to pass over his aggravated offence with a comparatively trifling punishment? Is this motive to lenity to be found in the eagerness which his lordship has ever shewn to heap up emoluments, and to systematize corruption? Is it in the gift of the chamberlainship of Fife granted to his wife, with arrears to a vast amount, procured under false pretences? Is it in procuring a year ago fifteen hundred a year in addition, not, sir, the salary of first lord of the admiralty, for I know that is very inadequately paid, but in addition to his salary as lord privy seal for Scotland? But, sir, the right hon. gent. lays a great deal of stress on his discovering no political or party partialities in the appointment of officers, either for the naval or military service. I deny, sir, that there is the least merit in this supposed impartiality. It is what every minister, whatever he is, is obliged to preserve an appearance of, as on open dereliction of it would be instant disgrace. I need not remind the house that lord North sent sir Charles Saunders and admiral keppel to Faulkland Islands, though that expedition unfortunately failed. Indeed party distinctions were almost always from necessity overlooked. But, sir, I cannot hear the359right hon. gent. stating that the noble lord was free from party violence, without minding the house of one or two circumstances, which demonstrate the existence of party spirit in all its most intolerant and disgusting features. I shall mention one, sir, which fell within my own knowledge, and which will fully illustrate my position. At a period of the late war, when the danger of invasion was supposed to be at the height, when offer a voluntary service were eagerly accepted, a numerous and loyal body of men in Tavistock made a tender of their services. The tender was refused by this self same moderate lord Melville, on the sole ground, for no other could be alleged, that the corps, when raised, was to be commanded by the late duke of Bedford. It may perhaps be imagined, that my feelings at the recollection of the deceased are so strong as to hurry me into some degree of exaggeration; but I solemnly protest that I am stating the matter precisely as it happened. And yet, sir, we are to hear of lord Melville's moderation and perfect freedom from all party spirit. There is another circumstance, which also pretty strongly illustrates his lordship's forbearance and superiority to any of the workings of the angry passions. It is well known that the dean of the faculty of advocates in Edinburgh is generally the most eminent person in the profession, and that it is seldom customary to interfere with him from any political considerations. Yet this mild and moderate lord Melville actually did interfere, and by employing all the influence of government against the hon. Henry Erskine, a gentleman confessedly the most eminent at the Scotch bar, was actually dispossessed of a situation which he had for many years held with the greatest honour and credit. So much, sir, for the boasted liberallity of the noble lord, which we are called on to look to for a motive to influence our decision!&#x2014;As to the favour bestowed on two noble lords, on which the right hon. gent. rested so much stress, I entirely agree with my hon. friend near me (Mr. Grey) in every one of his observations. The right hon. gent. says, that my two hon. friends must possess more than Spartan virtue to be able to follow that line of accusation against the noble lord which they had pursued. If extraordinary exertions in virtue were required, I do not know any men in whom they would be more readily found than in my hon. friends. But I must beg leave to say, that they are under no obligations to the noble lord for the defence he made of those relations,360to whom they were naturally so strongly attached, Sir Charles Grey and sir John Jarvis, were selected for a very difficult service in the West- Indies, which they performed with gallantry. Some misunderstanding, however, arising, they returned, and a charge was preferred against them in this house. If I recollect right, there were three divisions on the subject, when the minority were successively thirteen, fourteen, and seventeen, and this was the formidable phalanx which the noble lord had so much merit in combating. I take it for granted that he believed the charge to be false; and if he did believe it to be unfounded, what merit had he in defending the gallant officers? It was no more than an indispensible duty to those whom he had employed on a difficult service, which they executed with promptitude, vigour, and success. If this be merit, it is impossible to say, sir, how far the line of obligation may be extended.&#x2014;An hon. gent. under the gallery (Mr. Samuel Thornton), has given a curious reason for voting for the resolutions on Monday night, on which it is impossible for me not to make a few observations. He says, that he voted for the motion conceiving the noble lord guilty of a certain degree of negligence and inattention. I confess I am utterly astonished at such a declaration, after attending to the language of our resolution, that the noble lord had been guilty of a gross violation of an act of parliament, and a high breach of duty. Surely, sir, this heavy charge is not to be confounded with inattention and negligence. How the hon. member could have misunderstood them, is to me incomprehensible, as they were particularly objected to on the other side of the house, With respect to the resolutions, it appears to me that they complete the criminal part of the charge against the noble lord, and I am not at present for pressing any further proceedings in that way. If the attorney general is to proceed against him for refunding the money, derived from profits of money misapplied, this will be by civil, and not by criminal action, for recovery of money is always ranked among the civil actions. The same observation will apply to any action for recovering grants obtained under false pretences. I have the less objection to press the motion in the mean time, on the grounds of the pledge which the rt. hon. gent. has night so distinctly given to the house. I find, sir, after a careful examination, that during his majesty's long reign, now a period of nearly forty-five years, only the late duke of Devonshire and361myself, have been dismissed his majesty's councils, and I assure you, sir, we want no such person as the noble lord to be our associate. I had almost forgotten Mr. Grattan, who had the like fortune in Ireland. I believe the representatives of the late duke of Devonshire would have no objection, and I am sure I should be proud in his joining our small circle. None of us could, however, be proud of any connexion with such a man as lord Melville has shewn himself to be throughout his whole career of life. I have said, sir, that I would not now press the motion to a discussion, in consequence of the right hon. gent.'s pledge, but I should be grieved indeed to see the resolutions passed without being followed by some lasting result. Such a work as that which we on Monday accomplished must not be suffered to pass away unimproved. From one end of the empire to the other the people Will rejoice in the hope that a better system is a about to be adopted, and we must not let their just expectations be disappointed. It is necessary for us by making lord Melville a signal mark of the vengeance of this house to shew the country that we are indeed their representatives; that we are determined equally to watch over their property and their liberties. The public have received our work with the purest gratitude, but is there no part of this great work to belong to the government?&#x2014;Is his majesty to have no opportunity of manifesting his paternal interests on the subject? In What situation do we leave our sovereign? The people applaud us in the warmest terms. They say the house of commons have taken up our cause againt the whole host of contractors and peculators. The house of lords may do the same; and shall not our beneficent sovereign have an opportunity of expressing the warm interest he takes in every plan for alleviating the burdens and improving the condition of his people? I admire this house as the corner stone of the constitution&#x2014;as the source of all reforms and improvements&#x2014;as the balance by which the constitution is kept in purity and vigour. But I do not wish to exclude the monarchy from its proper share in every beneficent work. I think our resolutions ought to be presented to the throne. Should the house of lords also do the same thing, his majesty might thus be prevented from expressing his dissatisfaction on the subject, to the great prejudice of the people of England. Is that the situation in which ministers ought to leave their sovereign? The house may depend upon it, that this question will be a subject of consideration out of362doors for a long period of time, and that it will be agitated over and over again. It is materially connected with other abuses, and involves the dearest interest of the country. It should be remembered, that Great Britain is at present involved in a struggle which occasions considerable ferment in the public mind; and therefore the public ought to be convinced that substantial justice is done to them. Neglect on this topic will enable those who are inimical to monarchical government to draw a line of distinction between the monarchical part of the constitution and the house of commons; they feeling no mark of disapproval from his majesty similar to that expressed by this house. I Warn ministers not to leave it possible for such language to be held. Let them consider it as a question involving the dearest interests of the country, and the honour the sovereign whom they serve. Trusting, therefore, that ministers will do their duty, I have no Objection that the motion should be withdrawn, in the confidence of a more complete and satisfactory explanation and conclusion at a future day.", "author_id": "/people/mr-charles-fox-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

As guardians of the constitution, the house were met there to defend it from any inroads that might be made upon it, and he considered the resolutions which had been recently adopted as the most likely way to prevent danger to the constitution of the country, from the abuse of extraordinary power lodged in the hands of an individual. It behoved parliament to interfere whenever the public trust was abused or misapplied, and they should take every occasion to punish the offenders. This was the foremost of its duties. It was his opinion, and he mentioned it with deference, that it was the duty of parliament to inquire into all public abuses, and to follow up their resolutions by a minute investigation. He had declared his opinion on this matter on a former night, and he was perfectly satisfied with the sentiments he had delivered. When he voted the night before last, it was from strong sense of public duty, and his desire to maintain the character and reputation of that house. He came down to the house this night without any expectation of a measure similar to that proposed by the hon. gent.; being brought363forward. He had not had any communication with a single individual upon the subject; and he confessed it was not without some surprise, that he heard such a measure brought forward at the present time. He did not say that he should oppose the expediency of the measure of some future period., and vote against it, but he should not vote for it at this time. An hon. gent. had said, that the present motion was a direct corollary of the resolutions of a former night. What occasion then was there for any delay, and why did not the present motion immediately follow the former resolutions? Upon a conviction of the necessity of the vote he then gave, he might have felt it his duty then to have supported this. But, at the same time, he thought circumstances had, since then, been considerably changed, by the resignation of the noble lord, whom we were informed, had since retired from office. He had heard, with considerable pain, the sentiments delivered by a right hon. gent. (Mr. Canning); and he felt the dangerous consequences that were likely to ensue upon the avowal and maintenance of such pernicious principles. He felt as strongly as that right hon. gent. the impropriety of acting from party motives, and he strongly censured such as did. But the right hon. gent. argued thus: \"because I vote for you, you must in return vote for me.\" This, he thought, such an accommodation as was calculated to defeat the ends of justice. He thought it was a proof of honourable confidence, when a minister employed persons that differed from him in sentiment; and he could not but commend the noble lord, and every other person who acted in the same manner. The hon. member concluded, by entreating the hon. mover of the motion, not to do away the happy effect of the vote of the former evening, by attempting to go farther than some, he was persuaded, would think it their duty to accompany him. Governed by no popular feeling, he Would not say, whether he would or would not vote for the measure, but warmly urged the hon. gent. to withdraw his motion.", "author_id": "/people/mr-william-wilberforce-1", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

The proceedings of Monday would be nugatory if364they were not followed up by some motion like the present; at the same time he thought that the house should not be too precipitate in their steps; and he was not sure that it was adviseable to press it forward so rapidly as was proposed by the hon. gentleman.", "author_id": "/people/mr-john-fuller", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},
{"date": ["1805", "oct", "10"], "content": "&#x2014;Sir, I merely rise to express some reasons which I should hope would, in some degree, operate with the hon. mover to withdraw the present motion. I should previously apologize to the house for intruding, while under such severe indisposition, as I fear will scarce enable me to make myself heard. Sir, the hon. gent. who brought forward the resolutions on Monday, and other gentlemen on the same side of the question, used as their strongest argument, that the public looked to the virtue and dignity of the house for immediate justice, and for such severe resolutions as then were moved. The resolution being then carried respecting lord Melville, I mean to say no more upon it, except that God knows, the public must think it sufficiently severe. If the present one proposed was carried, what would the public say to it? They would, sir, instead of ascribing it to justice, to virtue, and a proper, dignified conduct in the house, ascribe it to what the hon. gent. below me (Mr. Fox), has so much dwelt upon, bitterness and rancour. They would say, this noble lord, after full forty years of most meritorious services to the state, and most of these in the highest situations, has had a very unmerited return, severe in the extreme, so much so, that all these measures taken by the house, must certainly have arisen, not from public virtue, but from a most persevering vindictive spirit. Sir, this conclusion is the more natural when we look to the character of that noble lord throughout the country. As to his being concerned in any sort of peculation, it is totally out of the question. No man whatever, I conceive, could believe a thing of the sort. There is no man that has the honour of his acquaintance, who does not know him to be incapable of benefiting by the public money, or by any other thing not perfectly honourable. Such suspicion could scarce arise in the mind of any person, as indeed being directly contrary to the habits of his life. No man has ever valued money less; indeed, from what we all know, if he had chosen to benefit by the public money, he might have had millions. On the contrary, those who have the pleasure of knowing365him best, I believe know, that if he made the two ends meet at the end of the year, he was well pleased. Much has been said about enmity and illiberality, I believe, sir, that all who know his lordship as well as I do, know him to be as honourable, liberal, and humane a character as ever existed. The subject which the hon. member below (Mr. Fox) urged so much, of his lordship's violence in turning out the dean of faculty, I must take the liberty of saying, is completely unfounded. Lord Melville had no more to do in the turning him out than you had. The dean of faculty, sir, is elected by the majority of the votes of that respectable body, over whom he presides, and no individual, however powerful, could influence them in their choice. I must also touch on something which fell from another hon. member of Ireland below me, who was offended with the right hon. gent. opposite (Mr. Canning) saying that no British lawyer would have so acted. The hon. Irish member I see does not know that we commonly, when speaking of British subjects, call them English, be they English, Scotch, or Irish; he therefore, I hope, will never be offended with the word English being applied in future to express any of his majesty's subjects, or suppose it can be meant as an allusion to any particular part of the united kingdom.", "author_id": "/people/mr-david-scott", "author_name": "", "house": "commons"},

There was a country which was probably known to the right hon. gent. only by the account given of it by Dr. Johnson. In that country (Scotland) lord Melville was known to be a bitter political adversary, and he was therefore the more surprised to hear the hon. member who spoke last, who was a native of Scotland, say, that lord Melville did not exert his influence in that country, in a particular instance, which had been alluded to by an hon. gent. near him. He would ask that hon. gent. or any other member of the house, to step forward and say that lord Melville had not exerted all his political influence, and in consequence had succeeded in turning off from a post of honour in the faculty of advocates, a gentleman who was an honour and an ornament to his profession.

{"date": ["1805", "oct", "10"], "content": "hoped it would not be necessary for him to make any apology for offering a few observations on what had been said. He had been arraigned by two right hon. gentlemen, both this night and on the former night, for the way in which he had opened the business. On the former night he had been accused of too much passion in his statement. As he was conscious of feeling nothing of the kind in his mind, he hoped the right hon. gent. would do him the justice to suppose that he had misconceived him in this respect. As to his statement of this night, he denied that he had blamed lord Melville for tendering in his resignation, He thought, on the contrary, that noble lord was right in retiring; but he must be of opinion that ministers were reprehensible in allowing him. There was this difference between him and Mr. Trotter; Mr. Trotter had been dismissed; he had re-368tired! He ought to have been dismissed as well as Mr. Trotter. The hon. gent., however, had been arraigned, as being nearly connected with sir Charles Grey, and also with sir John Jervis, with having omitted to recollect that the noble lord whom he now accused, had been the advocate and supporter of the two hon. characters. It never, however, entered into his mind that those two persons did owe any obligation to lord Melville. He had never considered lord Melville as their advocate. But, supposing it to have been the case, what was meant to he inferred from the fact? Was it to be alleged that the support which lord Melville then gave his two noble friends was a job, and that he (Mr. Whitbread) was now bound to do a job for lord Melville? Sir Charles Grey then stood on his trial. He was acquitted, and was twice thanked by that house for his conduct. Lord Melville, it may be said, moved for those thanks. Be it so. But would it be said he did so without thinking them merited? Far more, would it be urged, because lord Melville chose on that occasion to abandon his duty, that the hon. member and an hon. friend of his (Mr. Grey) were now called on to desert their duty? The right hon. gent. opposite had given a promise that night, that lord Melville should never again hold any office of trust in the management of public affairs; but might not his majesty change his advisers, and might not lord Melville be then again admitted into his councils? What means had the king of knowing what was done hi that house? Had the right hon. gent. communicated their resolutions to his majesty? That could not be; else he must have been dismissed, and would not have been allowed to resign. The hon. member felt anxious that the house should stand high in the public opinion; he felt doubly so, after the proceedings of the other night, lest it should be again let down. He begged to be allowed to state the way in which matters stood on the morning when they last adjourned. Many members were anxious that the concluding motion should then be made. He intimated his intention of bringing it forward that very night. Nothing fell from him indicative of any intention to relinquish his motion; he only wished to postpone the moving it for a few hours on account of the exhausted state of the house. The right hon. gent., without assigning any reason for the additional delay, proposed an adjournment for thirty-six hours. This Was objected to by his hon. friend (Mr. fox),369unless it was understood that in the interval no public business should take place; and the right hon. gent. with a countenance which he (Mr. W.) should not easily forget, said, upon every view of the case, it would be better to adjourn. Could it, however, be in the contemplation of the house, that this delay was for the purpose of allowing lord Melville time to resign? If any member, however, found themselves taken by surprise, he should withdraw his motion, but at the same time he knew that was not a thing calculated to satisfy the public. He said so, not in any spirit of resentment against lord Melville, as if this resolution were necessary to make him feel his situation. If he had any feelings, and the hon. member entertained no doubt he had, nothing could ring them more than the resolution already passed by that house. He was conscious the sense of the house went with him, that it was necessary that lord Melville should never again hold any office of trust. All, therefore, that he desired was to find out some way of entering this opinion on the journals of the house, and that the motion had on that account been withdrawn. The parallels which had been set up as to the motions against ministers being allowed to drop on their resignation, did not at all apply. They were made on the ground of incapacity; this was founded on a delinquency. He know that in common cases, to be expunged from the list of the privy council was no disgrace. It had occurred to his hon. friend (Mr. Fox). The right hon. gent. then in the plenitude of his power, had recommended it as a measure proper for his majesty's adoption. He had, however, since retracted that opinion, and had recommended to his majesty not only to restore him to that honour, but to promote him to his highest confidence. He had asked pardon for his offence before God and man. But, could ever such a recommendation avail in favour of lord Melville; after the resolutions adopted by that house?&#x2014;He was happy to understand that the Bank was not so much to blame as he had supposed; and also to learn, by what fell from the right hon. gent. (Mr. Canning), that the mode of conducting business in his office was entirely changed, such would always happen when principals began to do their duty. But, why, he must ask, was Trotter dismissed, and Wilson not? The right hon. gent. had said, wilson was a deserving officer. With all respect for the assertion of the right hon. gent. he, how-370ever could not help having also a high respect for the authority and opinion of the commissioners of naval enquiry; they said, and the hon. member said too, that Wilson was an improper person to continue in his present or in any other situation of public trust.&#x2014;The hon. gent. said he could not, after what had fallen from hon. friends of his, and from other hon. gentlemen, whose support he was anxious to procure, refuse, in the mean time, to withdraw his motion. He was anxious, however, lest the public should suppose that in passing their former resolutions, they had only adopted in a heat what they were unwilling to follow up; he, therefore, had to suggest what he hoped would meet the opinion of every gentleman present, that a copy of the resolutions of that house, of the former night, be laid before his majesty without any comment. By this means he conceived that the house and the public might be satisfied that lord Melville could not, with any consistency, be restored to any office of emolument for trust under the crown. This, he thought, was the best mode of conciliating different opinions&#x2014;He then moved, \"that his original motion be withdrawn;\" which being agreed to, the hon, gent. proposed, \"that the resolutions of Monday be entered, as read;\" which was also agreed to.

If it could be made out, that any communications to the enemy would follow, no man would be desirous of pressing such a proposition. But this did not seem to him to be possible.

He, however, had that confidence in the kindness and liberal feelings of their lordships, that they would extend the same indulgence to him, which persons who were not accustomed to address their lordships generally obtained. He would5not detain their lordships for any considerable length of time, but content himself with briefly adverting, to the principal features in the speech. The nature of the speech was such as, in his opinion, to preclude the possibility of any opposition to the address which he should have the honour of moving. With respect to the magnitude and importance of the successes which his majesty's arms had obtained, it was impossible there could be any difference of opinion in that house. The activity and perseverance which had been displayed in pursuing the fleets of the enemy, the vigour with which they were attacked when found, and the admirable skill with which that attack was directed, were among the most brilliant achievements in the naval annals of England. Great as the victory of Trafalgar was, the universal sorrow with which the intelligence of the heroic commander who fell in it was received by the country, proved that the triumph of that day had not been cheaply purchased. Venerating, as their lordships undoubtedly must, the services, the character of the immortal commander of the British fleet upon that occasion, with the sentiment which every one must feel of the great services which he had rendered to the country, asserting at once the supremacy of its naval power, and providing, by the almost total destruction of the combined fleet, for its safety, it was impossible that any one in the house could feel disposed to oppose that part of his majesty's speech, which recommended to parliament to enable his majesty to annex to the honours which he had conferred on the family of that great commander a fit mark of the national munificence.&#x2014;The unexpected and disastrous events which had taken place in Germany must be the subject of deep regret to every noble lord, who wished to see the overbearing ambition of France confined within limits consistent with the peace and, tranquillity of the rest of Europe. It, however, should be no small consolation to this country, that nothing had been left undone that depended upon her to ensure the success of the allied arms; and that though his majesty the emperor of Germany had been compelled to abandon the contest, we had still an unshaken, a magnanimous, and a powerful ally in the emperor of Russia. In the propriety of maintaining the closest connection with that great sovereign, he was persuaded their lordships would con-6cur with the recommendation in the speech. There was only one point upon which he would detain the house, and which, though not introduced into his majesty's speech, he hoped to be able to obtain the approbation of their lordships to insert in the address. He wished that some compliment of condolence should be offered to his majesty, upon the decease of his royal brother the late duke of Gloucester. With the amiable and excellent qualities of that much esteemed person, many of their lordships had been familiar for a number of years, and he was confident they would not be averse to express the high sense which they entertained of his virtues, and to condole with his majesty on that melancholy occasion. The noble earl concluded with moving, \"That an humble address be presented to his majesty\", which address was, as usual, an echo of his majesty's speech, and nearly the same as that which we insert in this day's proceedings of the house of commons; see page 15.", "author_id": "/people/mr-george-capell-coningsby", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},
{"date": ["1806", "jan", "28"], "content": "pursuant to notice, to move the thanks of the house to vice-admiral lord Collingwood, and the officers and men under his command, for their conduct in the action, and achieving the glorious victory off Trafalgar, on the 21 st of October last. In stating the grounds on which that motion proceeded, respecting which, he felt confident, there would be no difference of opinion in that house, he believed it would not be deemed irrelevant in him, before he proceeded farther, to endeavour to pay that tribute of applause, which they all must feel was due to that great and illustrious commander, under whose auspices that signal and glorious victory was achieved, whom it was the misfortune of the country to lose in the moment of victory; but a consummation, so glorious to himself, incontrovertibly established his claim to the meed of immortal honour. That, however, was not the sole misfortune the country had recently experienced. She had the misfortune, within a few months, to lose two of the most distinguished military and political characters that ever graced her annals, at an early, and about the same period of their respective lives; under circumstances, and at a time, when all the abilities, vigour, talent, and energy of the country, was requisite for her preservation. He felt, that part of what he now alluded to, was foreign from the subject he had regularly to observe upon, but so much more strongly the occasion which suggested it, that he could not repress its expression. His lordship proceeded to expatiate upon the character of the other illustrious individual, who was the subject of his recent general panegyric. The whole life of that great officer, he observed, was devoted to the service of his country; and never did there exist a person more fully and variously qualified effectually to forward that service, than the noble and gallant viscount, to whom he alluded. In contemplating his professional character, it was impossible to refrain from adverting to the merits of those76who had the opportunity of improving those talents, and directing that spirit of enterprise and intrepidity which displayed itself in his earlier years. On this head, much credit was due to sir Peter Parker, to lord Hood, to earl St. Vincent, and other distinguished officers, to whom such opportunities were afforded. To these, for their early distinguishing, and calling into action, the important qualifications, with which the late gallant viscount was so eminently endowed, much praise was due; and so far, it might be said, those distinguished officers, in the first instance, contributed their parts to the glorious and important services he subsequently rendered. It was not, however, to these great and pre-eminent considerations, of the important victories of the Nile, Copenhagen, and Trafalgar, that their lordships were alone to look for the merits and perfections of that gallant officer; on various occasions, even in the earliest part of his professional life, they were eminently to be found. His various services, as a subordinate officer, while on the Mediterranean station, were is that point of view, particularly to be regarded. In that quarter, not only his zeal and intrepidity were repeatedly manifested, but his talents and professional skill, and in a way which was unequalled by any other officer in similar circumstances! and the same superior display of talent and enterprise was uniformly exhibited by him on every occasion of separate command. When his majesty was first pleased to order a specific remuneration for his services, on the formal representation thereof, which, on his part, became necessary on such an occasion, that illustrious officer had truly set forth, that he was concerned in the capture of seven ships of the line, ten frigates, and a number of smaller armed vessels; that he had been one hundred and twenty times in action with his majesty's enemies, that he had lost one of his limbs, and one of his eyes. These were among the services of his early life, when he was yet comparatively unknown to the country as a distinguished commander, and previous to those glorious and immortal victories which eternised his fame to all posterity. On all these more important occasions, to which extensive command and proportionate responsibility were attached, his powers and exertions appeared to grow and to increase, in proportion to the magnitude and importance of the service on which he was employed.&#x2014;The late glorious action off77Trafalgar, the circumstances of which were so recent and so fresh in all their lordships' minds, it was needless to expatiate on; suffice it to say, that in extensive and important consequences, it exceeded every thing of the kind that graced the annals of the country. That glorious victory bore the same proportion in its magnitude, brilliancy, and important consequences, to the achievement at Copenhagen, that the latter did to the previously unparalleled victory of the Nile, and which, in fact, that victory did, in all those respects, to every other that preceded it. It seemed as if the energies of his mind, and the powers of his exertion, expanded, and progressively increased, on the respective occasions of those glorious victories, and in each of them he seemed to surpass what he had exhibited in the foregoing instance. The superior endowments possessed by the gallant admiral, were not to be considered alone as operating through himself; his example and influence pervaded ail those who were placed under him in command; his merits were not confined to that glorious energy he displayed in the heat of action; the coolness and discrimination of his mind, formed a pre-eminent trait in his character; his promptitude to make the most of every advantage that presented itself; a most striking instance of which, and of unprecedented presence of mind, was manifested in his conduct in the critical and important affair at Copenhagen. These, however, were far from constituting the whole of his merits as an officer; his breast burned with to pure, a noble, a generous love of glory, which was the main spring of all his heroic actions; and he had the faculty of electrifying all those around him with a similar enthusiasm. No marks of ferocity or cruelty, which so often stained the laurels of successful victories, ever dimmed the lustre of his achievements; but humanity and mercy were the characteristics of his glorious conduct after the hour of victory. His conduct in private life was equally admirable with that which he uniformly manifested in his professional career. All the virtues which could adorn human nature, were to be found in the illustrious Nelson. The attribute of mercy was what most eminently distinguished him. In the language of the poet, it was not his wish toWade through slaughter to a throne,\n            \"Or shut the gates of mercy on mankind.It was impossible the glorious example of such a man could be without a correspond-78ent effect on the character of others. In this way was to be considered the conduct of many of those who were placed under his command. The high opinion which the gallant lord expressed for that meritorious office, whose conduct was more regularly the subject of consideration that night, was equally creditable to both. On leaving this country, he expressed his satisfaction at the appointment of the noble Collingwood to the command; and his perfect confidence in his skill, talents and exertions. He then proceeded to comment on the gallant and meritorious conduct of lord Collingwood, in the action off Trafalgar, and of which many of the most skilful of the profession spoke in terms of unqualified applause. The first motion which he had to submit to their lordships was, for the thanks of the house to vice-admiral lord Collingwood; the second was for the like to rear-admiral the earl of Northesk; and, lastly, to the subordinate officers and seamen under their command; and, if ever skill and bravery were manifested by British officers and seamen, on any one occasion more than another, it was in the action off Trafalgar. Of this splendid and important victory, there was one prominent circumstance to be considered; namely, the great inequality of the contending fleets. He had to apologise to their lordships, for having detained them rather longer than was usual on such instances, but the proportionably greater magnitude and importance of the particular occasion, he trusted, would plead his excuse. He then moved, \"That the thanks of this house be given to vice-admiral lord Collingwood, for his very gallant and meritorious conduct in the command of the fleet under the late admiral lord viscount Nelson, in the action off Cape Trafalgar, on the 21st of October last, and that the lord Chancellor do communicate the said thanks to his lordship.\"", "author_id": "/people/mr-robert-jenkinson", "author_name": "", "house": "lords"},

Having said thus much, he should satisfy himself, for the present, with reading the amendment which he had drawn up. His lordship then read over the amendment. The purport of it tended to express the deep concern which the house felt at the disasters recently sustained by his majesty's allies on the Continent: and to assure his majesty, that the house would take the earliest opportunity of enquiring into the causes of these disasters, so far as they might be connected with the conduct of his majesty's ministers; and to suggest such measures as should appear to be necessary for averting the dangers which threatened this country.

That consideration ought, most certainly, to be no longer postponed than was necessary to put their lordships completely in possession of the subjects which demanded their most serious enquiry. It was desirable that their lordships' decision should9be preceded by the most complete investigation; but, for his own part, he confessed, that some of the topics connected with the present state of the country were so urgent, that any delay in bringing them under discussion could be justified only by the motive which influenced the conduct of the noble lord below him. There was not a man of liberal ideas, but must feel the deepest regret for the indisposition of the individual to whom he alluded. If such must be the feeling of that noble lord, and of every other man, how much more forcibly must that sentiment of regret he felt by himself, who had passed so many years of his life in the most intimate connection with the right hon. gentleman? At the same time that he thus felt himself bound to express his gratitude to the noble lord, for the motive which inclined him to postpone his intended amendment, he was also called upon to thank him, for his determination to bring forward the subject on an early day.

There was not an Englishman but must experience the sincerest regret at the indisposition of an individual who was the admiration, not only of his own country, but of the world; and he could well believe, that the impression which it made on the feelings of the noble lord, must be increased in a degree proportioned to the sincere friendship which had long subsisted between them, and the more intimate opportunities which he had had of appreciating his transcendent merits. He could, however, assure their lordships, that his majesty's ministers were then fully prepared, should it be the pleasure of the house, to enter into the most comprehensive discussion of their conduct. But he would, at the same time, freely state, that his majesty's speech was intentionally couched in such language as it was supposed would create no difference of opinion as to the terms of the address. Ministers felt, that the existing state of affairs required the most ample communications on their part; and they were anxious only to delay any discussion until such communications could be laid before parliament.
