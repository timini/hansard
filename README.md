I'm just starting out with an analysis of the UK Parlimentary Archive. The broad goals at the minute are to create language models from the speaches give by UK officials in the House of Commons and the House of Lords. I have many interestng questions to answer about this dataset, please take a look at the issues here to see some that are being investigated.
